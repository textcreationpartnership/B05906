            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:179659:8"/>and aſſiſtance, of giving which he judged him no doubt very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, otherwiſe he would never have kept that intimate correſpondence with him, which it is very well known he did.</p>
                  <p>He was alſo a perſon of a pleaſant Converſation, and altogether free of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, took delight when deſired, to diſcourſe of his Art, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to ſuch Gentlemen, whom he thought inclined to like horſes, and alſo without any kind of reſervedneſs anſwered them ſuch Queſtions, as they (out of an earneſt deſire to be inſtructed by ſo knowing and excellent a Maſter) thought fit to propoſe to him: And I can ſay this with the more certainty being my ſelf many times an Eye-witneſs to it, becauſe of my good fortune in being for near two years his Schollar; ſo that for my own part, I do ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the very little I underſtand of Horſemanſhip, I owe either to his good Inſtructions when alive, or to his Writings now he is gone, and I make no doubt, but they ſhall have the like good effects upon any ingenious Reader, who with a ſincere Intention and judicious reflection, ſhall deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeriouſly peruſe them.</p>
                  <p>T'is true his Writings are not many, but of all of them which to my knowledge are extant, this Intituled <hi>The Parfait Mareſchal,</hi> which I have taken the pains to Tranſlate, is accounted the chief, and alſo lookt upon by the moſt part of underſtanding Horſemen, who have throughly peruſed it, to be indeed a <hi>Maſter peice</hi> upon the Subject whereof it treateth; and that I may in a few words give you a general <hi>Idea</hi> of its Contents, ſuch ſhort and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial accounts proving frequently very acceptable, eſpecially of a Book wherein there is ſomewhat more than ordinary expected; I ſhall briefly run through the general heads of the whole.</p>
                  <p>The Book then is divided into two parts, and in the <hi>First Part</hi> you have, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſeveral diſcourſes ſhowing the true ſhapes of a horſe, with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act directions to prevent being impoſed upon, and Cheated when you come to buy one, where alſo all the imperfections of a horſe both Before and Behind, are deſcribed ſo to the Life, that a Man muſt be very dull if he come not to underſtand them: <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have a diſcourſe of <hi>Shoeing,</hi> and excellent directions to keep horſes of all kinds, whether for Saddle or Coach, either at home or upon Travel, with an exact deſcription of what Furniture is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Travel, and how to preſerve your horſes from being ſpoilt by it; which is no ſmall matter, as I believe all who have made either a Campaign, or any great Journey, can teſtify: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you have methods ſet down to be uſed in the Spring, for preventing Diſeaſes in horſes, together with the Art of Bleeding and Purging: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You have an account of all the Plaiſters and Ointments, that are moſt uſeful in the Cureing of Horſes; and then <hi>Lastly,</hi> this <hi>First Part</hi> is cloſed with two moſt uſeful Diſcourſes, The <hi>Firſt</hi> concerning the raiſing a true Breed of Horſes, and the <hi>Second</hi> of Bits and Branches, where you have exact Inſtructions, for fitting all kinds of horſes with proper and convenient Bridles, let their Mouths be never ſo bad; of all which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the particulars, would be too Tedious in this place, and therefore I forbear it, but they are indeed the very beſt that ever I read upon theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Second Part,</hi> You have a moſt exact and learnd Deſcription, of all the Diſeaſes this moſt uſeful Creature is ſubject to, together with their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and a moſt methodical way of applying them, either according to the different Conſtitutions of the Horſes you have to deal withal, or the mildneſs and Malignity of the Diſeaſe: And indeed in this point he ſo far exceeds all other Authors, that they may be very well ſaid only ſuperficially to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Receipts, but he both to recommend and apply them to the bottom, and that for the moſt part with ſuch ſucceſs, that they rarely fail to eradicate,
<pb facs="tcp:179659:8"/>the very principles of that Ferment which occaſioned the diſtemper; Thus much of our excellent Author, and the general Heads of his Book.</p>
                  <p>It now remains that I give the Reader a ſhort account, of that wherein I think my ſelf a little more particularly concerned, and that is, of this Tranſlation of it into Engliſh, which I alſo Judge ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe of ſome conſiderable alterations I have made in it, which are not to be found in the French Coppy; for</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Whereas in the French Impreſſion the Treatiſe of Diſeaſes is in the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> I have in this Tranſlation placed it in the <hi>Second,</hi> which was the true form and order, it was firſt writ and publiſhed in at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Author himſelf, he being neceſſitate (as you may ſee more at large in his own enſueing Preface) to tranſpoſe the parts of this laſt Edition, that by ſo conſiderable an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, his own True and Genuine Copies, might be diſtinguiſhed from ſome Falſe ones, which were about that time Counterfeit at <hi>Lions;</hi> and even although it had not come at firſt from our Authors Hands in this Order, yet would I have inclined for ſeveral Reaſons to make this Alteration; for to inſtance but one; is it not a great deal more methodical, yea even more natural, that a man ſhould firſt know the true Shapes of a horſe, and wherein the Perfection and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of each particular Member conſiſts, as alſo how to Govern him at Home and upon Travel, then that he at very firſt engage himſelf, in the ſtudy of Cureing all the Diſeaſes, and Accidental Diſaſters, to which this moſt ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and uſeful Creature is but too frequently ſubject? To do otherwiſe, is me-thinks to Renverſe the Order of things, and a man had as good attempt to read before he can Spell, or run before he can walk, as endeavour to know what belongeth to the Cure of Horſes, without firſt underſtanding theſe very firſt Rudiments of Horſemanſhip I have named; Now this is what the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Book in the French Coppy treateth of, and therefore I thought fit in this Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make it the <hi>Firſt;</hi> ſo here you have the Reaſon, and I think a very good one too, for the firſt conſiderable Alteration in this Book, to wit the Tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of its parts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, the dividing the moſt part of the Chapters into Sections, which to me ſeemed a much more diſtinct way, eſpecially for the Second Part, then that uſed by the Author, becauſe in that Part, he maketh almoſt always a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of each different Receipt, as well as of every particular Diſeaſe or Diſtemper, which did ſo mightily encreaſe the Number of Chapters, that they amounted in that one Part to 180. and were in my Opinion very inconvenient, not ſo much becauſe of their great Number, as becauſe no man could eaſily at firſt view, know by the Title of the Remedy, to what Diſeaſe it was chiefly appropriate; at preſent I have endeavoured to rectify this, by making almoſt no more Chapters in the 2d <hi>Part,</hi> than there are Diſeaſes or Infirmities incident to Horſes (which however ſtill amount to about 120) and reducing all the Remedies for each particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, to Diſtinct Sections only; So that a man may now at firſt opening the Book, know certainly by the direction for the Chapter at the head of each Page, that ſuch a Diſeaſe is particularly treated of in that Chapter, and conſequently that all the Sections contained in it, are only ſo many different Remedies, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appropriate to that Diſeaſe or Infirmity, although they may be alſo good for ſome others, according as they ſhall be particularly preſcribed by the Author.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Alteration, or rather Improvement I have made, and which is not to be found in any of the French Impreſſions, is <hi>First,</hi> the Addition of a moſt exact Collection of Horſemanſhip, which I have taken from the very beſt of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon that Subject, and which I thought fit to add to the Firſt Part by way of <hi>Supplement,</hi> there being little or nothing of the Art of Riding contained in it: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> An Alphabetical Catalogue, of all the Simples and Drugs diſperſed through the whole Book, together with their French and Latin Appellations;
<pb facs="tcp:179659:9"/>as alſo for the benefite of ſuch as do not underſtand them, a ſhort explication of the Weights and Meaſures, with the moſt uſeful French <hi>Terms</hi> of Horſemanſhip, mentioned throughout the whole work, all which are likewiſe ſet down in an Alphabetical order, immediatly after the Catalogue of Simples.</p>
                  <p>Now this little <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Catalogue. I judged would be of ſingular uſe, for although the Book be in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, yet the Catalogue maketh it almoſt univerſally uſeful, all Europe over; For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuppoſe a Gentleman buy this Book, and for the benefit of his Horſes take it along with him to the Army in <hi>Flanders, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom in Europe, I ſay underſtanding Engliſh, if he intend to cauſe compoſe any Remedy, he needs but apply himſelf to ſome skilful Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary (who if he be ſuch, muſt be Maſter of Latin, or at leaſt ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Latin Names of all Simples) to whom reading over the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Names of the Druggs, together with their Doſes, which compoſe any Remedy, the Gentleman himſelf explaining, in any Language, wherein he can be beſt underſtood by the Apothecary, the method of Compoſition from this Engliſh Impreſſion; the Apothecary, I ſay, if he be not a meer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or blockhead, cannot fail being thus directed, to make up exactly the moſt compoſed Remedy in the whole Book, and the Ointment, Charge, Drench, or whatever elſe, being once prepared, the Gentleman may give Orders anent it himſelf, according to the Directions of the Book, with the ſame dexterity and certainty, as if he had been at home in his native Countrey, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt made up by a <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Apothecary; all which is certainly no ſmall Advantage to any of our Countrey-men, who by their employments in time of War, are obliged to a frequent attendance upon the Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or elſewhere, as his Majeſtie's Service ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>So you ſee, you have in this one Book, all that any Gentleman needs know, either as to <hi>Breeding, Backing, Bitting, Keeping, Cureing,</hi> or <hi>Shoeing</hi> any kind of Horſe, for whatever Service he be deſigned, and therefore I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, no judicious Perſon, who is a lover of Horſes, will diſpute the uſefulneſs of this Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>The Book, as I told you before, is in <hi>French,</hi> Entituled, <hi>Le Parfait Mareſchal,</hi> or Compleat Farrier, and how much we ſtand in need of good ones, whereof there is ſuch a ſcarcity in theſe Iſlands, I leave to thoſe, who having Horſes of a conſiderable Value, ſometimes falling ſick amongſt their hands, and know not poſſibly what methods to take for their Recovery, to judge; And indeed, to deal ingenuouſly, it was chiefly this Conſideration, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the eſteem I had for the Author, and great delight I take my ſelf in Horſes, which firſt put me upon the Fancy of Tranſlating it, wherein, if I have gratifyed a good many Curious Gentlemen, who earneſtly wiſht for it, yet I am perſwaded I have diſappointed not a few Criticiſing. I ſhould have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, Invidious and Self conceited Sparks, who with all their hearts I know expected, and wiſhed me to fail in my undertaking, and who are ſo mean ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they cannot endure any publick Work ſhould be gone about, which they are not either capable to perform themſelves, or of the Theory whereof they are not at leaſt ſo much Maſters, as to be in a capacity, without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ignorance, to pretend and alledge the commiſſion of ſome few faults or eſcapes, whereby they may have a kind of pretext to backbite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Performer: But for the exactneſs of the Tranſlation, I leave it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it ſelf, being very certain, that whatever Faults ſome Nice people may find in the Language, yet they will find none in the Sence, which is what I chiefly aimed at in the Verſion: and for their Critical Backbiting, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Humour, I am reſolved not to be in the leaſt concerned at it, ſeeing in my opinion, the very Vice it ſelf, carries along with it its own puniſhment,
<pb facs="tcp:179659:9"/>beſides, I am of St <hi>Valerian</hi>'s mind, that, <hi>Plena victoria eſt ad clamantem tacere, &amp; non reſpondere provocanti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, ſeeing this Book in French is acknowledg'd by all who ever peruſed it, to be the beſt, and moſt methodical that ever was writ upon the Subject, I cannot comprehend, how we in Britain have ſo far overſeen our ſelves, as altogether to neglect its Tranſlation till now, eſpecially, when ſo few Curious Books are publiſhed in <hi>French</hi> upon any other Subject, but what are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly made <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but I judge the Reaſons of it to be chiefly theſe four.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> It was too great, nay I may rather ſay too difficult a task for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Farrier to undertake, both becauſe of the <hi>French</hi> Language, which few of that Profeſſion are Maſters of; as alſo, becauſe there is in it, a great deal more of what by Phyſicians is called <hi>Method,</hi> than in any Book as yet writ upon the ſame Subject; No wonder then, the Engliſhing of it was not attempted by ſuch, whoſe knowledge in Phyſick is generally but very ſuperficial, and Practice not performed with near ſo much Order and Method as is to be found here: It may alſo be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Farriers,</hi> whoſe Tread and Calling is their Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, may have willingly omitted it, (even although otherwiſe very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing it) leſt its accuracy and plainneſs, for both which this Book is ſo highly eſteemed, might have prejudged their Employment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are but few Gentlemen, who although very capable to undertake ſuch a Work, will yet be at the trouble and pains to engage in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible what a vaſt difference there is, between Engliſhing a few Pages, and tranſlating a conſiderable Volume; and I know, that many have for this very reaſon admited, how that I, whoſe Employment and Buſineſs lay not at all this way, ſhould have ever concerned my ſelf with it: But to ſatisfy a little ſuch inquiſitive Perſons as to this. I ſay, that the Subject I have made choice of, is not only very Gentlemany, and therefore worthy any mans allowing ſome ſpare hours upon the ſtudy of it, but I muſt alſo let them know, that ſeveral things which many other Gentlemen look upon as toils and troubles, are to me real Recreations and Divertiſements; and as it is my humor to abominate idleneſs, ſo I always deſigned that my innocent Occupations, might not only be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſeful to my ſelf, but alſo beneficial, if poſſible, to others, whereof I have already given ſeveral Proofs, in treating of a Subject no leſs uſeful and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemany than this; and as the divertiſement and ſatisfaction I have had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating this Tranſlation, hath abundantly recompenſed my labour (for I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you what ever may be the thoughts of ſome narrow and mean ſpirited Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I never intended any proſpect of gain ſhould) ſo I make no doubt, but the ſerious peruſal of it will ſufficiently anſwer my expectation, by giving all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſatisfaction to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Reaſon proceeds from an Objection, which I have heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made againſt the Book in General, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of its Receipts are not only difficult to prepare, but alſo very chargeable; now although I know this will have no weight with any who know the Book, yet ſeeing it hath been, and ſtill may be a Stumbling-block to many, who know not its Worth and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I ſhall endeavour to remove it. <hi>First</hi> then, as to the great difficulty there is in prepareing ſome of the Receipts, I ſay that is eaſily remeded. by either making uſe of ſuch as are leaſt compoſed, (and whereof there are a great many in the Book, of the ſame nature and vertue, although not altogether ſo great, with thoſe that are moſt difficult to prepare) or otherwiſe, where there is an abſolute neceſſity to make uſe of any which are more compoſed; by employing ſome diſcreet and skilful Apothecary, who may be commonly found in the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Town or Village: And as to the <hi>Second,</hi> which is their chargeableneſs and exceſſive Rate, beſides, as I have already ſaid, that there are many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of an eaſie compoſition, as well as more difficult, ſo there are alſo others
<pb facs="tcp:179659:10"/>which may be had at a very eaſy Rate, and are therefore moſt proper for Horſes of a ſmall value; not but that they are alſo good for the fineſt of Horſes, however I judge them more proper for the courſeſt and moſt common, ſuch as your ordinary Hackneys, plough and Cart-horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where a man hath Horſes which are very fine, and of a great value, I cannot imagine, that he will grudge at the giving out twenty <hi>ſhillings,</hi> that ſo he may ſave himſelf 100, 200, or 300 <hi>Pounds,</hi> many Horſes in Europe being known to be valued at theſe Rates, and even in <hi>England</hi> there are ſome of 100, 150, and 200 <hi>Pounds</hi> price, ſo that I ſay, to ſave Horſes of ſo great a value, I cannot fancy that any Nobleman, or Gentleman, who takes delight in them, will ſcruple the laying out of 20 or 30 <hi>ſhillings,</hi> which is more than the price of the moſt compoſed Remedy in the whole Book; and although the common Vehicle recommended by our Author, be Claret or White Wine, both becauſe the courſeſt kind of it, which is good enough for Horſes, is procured at a very eaſy Rate in <hi>France,</hi> as alſo becauſe they have not in that Country the conveniency of getting good Ale, yet it doth not hinder, but that in many caſes where he ordereth Claret or White Wine, we in theſe Iſlands, (where Wines are ſold at a pretty dear Rate, and where good Ale may be eaſily had) may make uſe of Ale, if we find no indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity lying upon us, to make only uſe of Wine, which in ſome caſes there is, as the nature of the Remedy, with a little Experience will quickly diſcover to any: And thus I hope I have removed a common, but in my Opinion, very weak and frivolous Objection, made by a kind of men, who value a <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Noble,</hi> more than the fineſt <hi>Courſer</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Reaſon, why this Tranſlation hath been omitted, and which will, I believe, be found to be the ſtrongeſt of all, is that we are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much perſwaded of the Ezcellency of our old Writers, ſuch as <hi>Blundevil, Markham, De la Gray,</hi> and ſome others, that we imagine none can outſtrip or exceed them, and yet the moſt part of thoſe who have writ in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language upon this Subject, were <hi>French</hi> Men; For the <hi>Duke of Newcaſtle,</hi> by what I can learn, never writ any thing of <hi>Marſhalry,</hi> what ever he might have done, had he lived, for we find in his Engliſh Book of Horſemanſhip laſt Publiſhed, that he deſigned ſuch a Treatiſe, but that it was ever either finiſhed, or ſo much as begun to, is what I could never as yet be certainly informed of; ſo that, generally ſpeaking, I ſay we muſt ſtill acknowledge, that we are in a great meaſure beholden to the <hi>French,</hi> for our chiefeſt Knowledge and Skill in this Science; and who ever ſhall take the pains to peruſe theſe Writers and this, as I have done the moſt part of them, will find ſuch a difference betwixt them, that I am confident, if he be any thing of a Horſeman, he will make no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
                  <p>Let this long neglect then of ours, now we have this admirable Piece in our own Language, make us the more foreward, throughly to peruſe and practiſe its Directions, that ſo we may with the greater ſucceſs, improve in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Science, which (as the Art Military) is lookt upon not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtudy even of Princes, whereof ſeveral inſtances might be given; and that this Tranſlation may have ſo good and wiſhed for effect, is the earneſt deſire of him, who is not only a Well-wiſher to Marſhalry and Horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but alſo according to his ſmall power and capacity, an Encourager and Promoter of all Heroick and Gentlemany Studies and Exerciſes whatſoever.</p>

                  <head>THE AUTHOR'S EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
                  <p>HERE is a new Edition of the <hi>Parfait Mareſchal,</hi> wherein I am to give you new diſcoveries, which without doubt will make it preferable to the former; I changed many things in the laſt, to distinguiſh it from thoſe which were Counterfeit by ſome Bookſellers at <hi>Lions,</hi> accuſtomed to deceive the Publick by defective Editions, wherein they ſhamefully join Negligence with Diſhoneſty; They altered in this my Work the Names of the Drugs, and thereby rendered them unintelligible; they falſified in many remedies the Doſe, and conſequently made the Cure worſe than the Diſeaſe: To free the publick of this inconveniency I have in this new Edition changed the order of the preceeding, by tranſpoſing the two Parts which compoſe the Whole, and putting the <hi>Second</hi> in place of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the end ſo remarkable a change, which immediatly strikes the Eyes, might without Choquing either Reaſon or Symmetry, ſerve to diſtinguiſh the true and genuine Copies from the falſe.</p>
                  <p>Since that time, Experience and Reflections have given me new Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whereof I intend to make the Publick a Sharer; thereby the better to Anſwer the expectation of many Strangers, who having already Tranſlated this Book into ſeveral Languages, and preparing for new Editions, will be no doubt very well ſatisfied, to find it more Exact and Correct than heretofore: In many parts I have taken away whole Remedies, which appeared to me not ſo good as thoſe I have put in their places, and I have cleared the most part of the Pages, of thoſe trouble ſome Characters, ſuch as <hi>Croche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I had left in my former Editions, out of an indulgent Humor, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of many <hi>Farriers,</hi> and ſome opiniative Humours, certain Remedies, or rather certain Old <hi>Rotes</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> which a long cuſtom had ſo Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed, that I ſcarcely believed I could wholly destroy them; at preſent I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this Tolleration, and although I put my ſelf in hazard of exciteing againſt me this Croud of People, infatuated with their falſe Opinions, yet I declare that I am abſolutely againſt theſe Old and deſpicable <hi>Routines,</hi> and pretend
<pb facs="tcp:179659:11"/>after having first rejected them, to ſubſtitute in their places wholſome Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for example; amongst the different Remedies which I had given for Foundering in the feet, I had ſlipt in that bad Cuſtom of <hi>Gartering,</hi> for Reaſons I ſhall explain in the Chapter Treating of that Infirmity; If I had omitted that <hi>Routine,</hi> People would either have accuſed me of ſingularity, or that I had been ignorant of a practice, which had been by time beyond the compaſs of Memorie, rooted and establiſhed among the <hi>Farriers;</hi> Now, I quit that Circumſpection, and intend to prove that the uſe of Garters is to be aboliſhed, and that if they are not altogether unprofitable, yet they generally do more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice than good. This I ſhall make clearly appear to ſuch, who are endued but with a moderate portion of Reaſon and good ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame with what they commonly practiſe upon a Horſe that is strained in the Shoulder or Haunch, for ſeveral <hi>Farriers</hi> prepoſseſt with the old <hi>Routine,</hi> cauſe the Horſe if the strain be in the Shoulder (<hi>Nager à Sec</hi> as the French call it, which is nothing elſe but the tying up of the ſound Leg, with a peice of ſmall Rope to his fore thigh, that ſo he may not ſet it to the ground, and then they conſtrain him to walk upon his three Legs; You ſhall have the Reaſon why they do this in its proper place) and if it be in the Haunch, then they make him draw in the Harrows, which is nothing elſe but to redouble the pain in a part already very much afflicted; and it is the ſame, as if a man who hath ſtrained his Knee or Thigh, ſhould go <hi>Cripple</hi> and walk upon it.</p>
                  <p>But in this occaſion they don't reſt there, for having forced the horſe either to walk thus upon three Legs, or to draw in the Harrows, they at the very ſame time, blood him in the Plat Veins, or flat of the Thighs, which is a manifest <hi>Counter-time,</hi> and very great imprudence, becauſe the horſe's whole Blood being agitated by the violent motion of going upon three Legs. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there evacuats none but that which is purest, and moſt filled with Animal Spirits; So that nature remains weakned, and far leſs capable to Re eſtabliſh the Shoulder or Thigh which they intend to Cure; Beſides that to take Blood in ſuch an occaſion from the Plat-Vein, is but to draw down the Humor upon the part afflicted, whereas by a more judicious practice, they might make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion and divert it, by Blooding in the Neck.</p>
                  <p>Don't they fall again into another Mistake againſt Good Practice and Custom, when they ſuſpect a Horſe of having the Glaunders, becauſe he hath Kernels, and casteth at the Noſe? for then they begin by removing the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels as if they were the Cauſe of the Glanders, whereas they are only its Effects, and a Horſe is no leſs Glander'd for having the Kernels taken away; alſo a Horſe which casteth at the Noſe, may be perhaps but Colded, although he appear to have the Glanders: But their abuſe goes yet further, becauſe when they obſerve that a Horſe Casts after the Kernels are removed, they then give him ſome Cordials after their own faſhion, which neither Cure the Horſe, nor ſo much as prevent his Casting, ſo that for laſt refuge they Purge and Repurge him, which is a great abuſe, and the true and ready way to render the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe incureable; it being most certain, that Purging in ſuch a caſe produces a bad effect, becauſe it diſorders and confounds nature, by forceing her to take another way to diſcharge her ſelf, than that ſhe would have choſen of her own accord: They would prevent ſuch accidents as theſe, if they were capable of a little Speculation, but it is not for them this Axiom is made, <hi>Medicus eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector naturae;</hi> for in fine a man ſhould always accomodate himſelf to Nature, and croſs and oppoſe her as little as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I could play the Critick longer, and could recite a great many more examples, but I refer the Reader to the Firſt<note n="*" place="margin">In this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Second.</note> part of this work, which will instruct him in every thing relating to the Knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:179659:11"/>Horſes, and aſſiſt him to make Judicious Reflections upon the Cauſe and Signs of their Diſeaſes; he will find them there Defined with ſo great care and exactneſs, that he will ſcarcely receive more exact <hi>Ideas</hi> of them any where elſe, and if he will but join to them a little Practice, and apply himſelf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Application of the Remedies, he will be in no danger of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by the Miſchievous and pitiful <hi>Routines</hi> of ſome of our common <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,</hi> and of another Set of People who are no leſs to be feared. I mean certain Half knowing Men; who having but Superficial Notions of what I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, fancie to amuſe the World with a great <hi>Fracas</hi> of words, but ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold their peace when People require their Effects: I tell my Opinion with a great deal of freedom, but yet with more Ingenuity and Candor, and all know that my Words and Actions are free from any mean By end, and that I have no other motive herein, but after a Generous way to oblige the Publick, and particularly thoſe who delight in Horſes. I conclude, by ſaying that a Man may alſo receive ſome happy Impreſſions, relating to this Subject and ſome others fit for frameing the Spirit of a Young Gentleman, by Reading a Book entituled in French, <hi>Les Arts De l'homme d'epée,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>G. Guillet,</hi> wherein is found amongst other things, the Facility of Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, for the Terms and Definitions of each Subject, are there ſet down in an Alphabetical order: Many people have found ſo much good by it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that I fancie the Publick will be in ſome meaſure beholden to me for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt all the Creatures, there is none which yeeldeth more profit and pleaſure to Man than the Horſe; He is Stately in Triumphs,<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> adroit and bold in the moſt Dangerous Engagments, and ſtrong and hardy to endure any kind of Fatigue or Labour: A Horſe is uſeful in all the great Interpriſes of War: There is none more fit for Traffick and Husbandry, nor ſo agreeable for divertiſement: But all Horſes which People make choice of both for War and the Mannage, do not always anſwer Expectation: and of thoſe alſo which are deſigned for draught, many are overcome by a Moderat Labour, and can endure no extraordinary Fatigue; yea Travellers do not always meet with that conveniency and pleaſure which they expect from their Journey Pads; All the advantages which may juſtly be expected from Horſes are not eaſy to be met with, and that which is moſt troubleſome of all to thoſe who diligently ſeek after them, is, that after they have met with a good and well ſhapt Horſe, and one that is adroit and vigorous, oft times for want of skill to Govern him, or thorow the remiſneſs of a Groom who neglecteth to dreſs him, for not having regulat his Dyet, or for having watered him unſeaſonably, or by any other accident, (which the want of skill in this Art may have made a Man fall into) the Horſe is brought to ſuch a Condition as renders him altogether unſerviceable: theſe Malheurs are oft-times of great importance, and prove alwayes hurtful, yet they ſo frequently fall out, that without a little experience and Skill, a particular application, and exact precaution for preventing them, a Man cannot ſometimes ſhun loſeing Horſes of conſiderable value.</p>
                     <p>I am therefore perſwaded, that thoſe who delight in Horſes will be very well ſatisfied, that I have taken the pains to make this Book appear in publick, with all the perfection imaginable lay in my power: In the ſeveral impreſſions which have been hitherto, I made the publick a ſharer of the skill, which I acquired not only from new Remedies, but alſo from ſeveral Experiences and obſervations for the application of the ſaid Remedies; I therefore hope that this laſt Edition will clear all the Doubts which have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me, and that People will find in it wherewithal to ſatisfie themſelves: I am in a continual practice, and I ſee an infinite number of Diſeaſ'd Horſes, ſo that daily I learn and diſcover things, which were either doubtful, or unknown to me; It was alwayes my aim to find out eaſie Remedies, and alſo ſufficient to recover Horſes, and put them in a condition to ſerve, in which I ſucceeded ſometimes: And in this Edition if you will give your ſelf the trouble to peruſe it, you will find that I have taken away ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which were too difficult to be practiſed, and have put in their places others farmore eaſy and as good, that I have alſo amended the faults which were in others, and finally that I have put all things in ſuch a condition, that I believe thoſe who are curious will confeſs, that I muſt needs have been at a great dale of pains, to bring this Book to that exactneſs in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179659:23"/>which it is at prelent; I preſcribe not in it any new Recept, but what by experience hath been found good, and for the convenience of thoſe who deſired it, I have reduced it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts.</p>
                     <p>That I may therefore inſtruct you methodically, to prevent all the above-mentioned inconveniencies, I ſhall firſt teach you to know all the parts of a Horſe, the ſame figures which are in the Diſcourſe, being to be found upon the following print in their reſpective places, ſee plate 1ſt.</p>

                     <p>THE Head being the ſeat of the Animal faculty,<note place="margin">CHAP. I. The Names of all the parts, which generally frame or Compoſe a Horſes Body.</note> the ſource of docility and Caprice, the Principle of motion and reſt, is without debate the moſt conſiderable part of a Horſes Body; it conſiſts of diverſe parts, which according as they are juſtly proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, give it it's exact ſhape and comlineſs; I ſhall name them briefly and in order, contenting my ſelf for the moſt part with the repreſentation of them, as they are mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Figures in the following Plate which is the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The EARS are a part well known.</p>
                     <p>The FOREHEAD is marked 1.</p>
                     <p>The TEMPLES are marked 2.</p>
                     <p>The EYE-PITS, or Hollowes which are above the Eye-brows, and which when very deep cauſe a horſe look ſurly and ugly, by making him appear old, are marked 3</p>
                     <p>The EYE-BROWS are above the eyes, and below thoſe above mentioned Pits.</p>
                     <p>The EYES (by which as in a looking Glaſs may be perceived the mettle, Courage, Malice, Health, and Indiſpoſition of a Horſe) ſhould be conſidered with attention; they conſiſt of two parts, not to mention the Eye-lids, which are thoſe Skins which cover the Eyes, when a Horſe is either aſleep or ſhutting them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part is the Glaſs or Criſtal, which encloſeth the whole ſubſtance of the Eye, and giveth it the form of a tranſparent Glob: I will not diſcourſe here of the Humours whereof the Eye is Compoſed, that diſcourſe belonging properly to Phyſicians.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part is the ground or bottom of the Eye, which is properly the pupil or Apple of the Eye, and which is called by ſome the joy or Life of the Eye; the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this diviſion of the eye is of Conſequence, that theſe two parts may be the better Diſtinguiſhed and not confounded together, for the Criſtal is that part of the Eye people perceive at the very firſt looking to it, and the bottom or apple of the Eye is not perceived, but by looking attentively, and in through the criſtal to it, and then will the ground or inward part of the eye appear.</p>
                     <p>Behind the eyes and towards the Throat, is the GANACHE (as they called it in <hi>French</hi>) or that part of the Nether <hi>Jaw-bone,</hi> which when a Horſe hath his head exactly well placed, toucheth the neck next to that part of it, which is called the Onſet of the Head; it is moveable, and ſerveth to give his under-jaws that motion, by which with the help of the teeth, they chaw and grind his provender; it is marked 4.</p>
                     <p>The NOSTRILS are thoſe overtures, through which a Horſe doth breath.</p>
                     <p>The NOSE is at the end of the head, and below the Noſtrils marked 5.</p>
                     <p>The word MOUTH is only appropriat to men, and by a particular priviledge to Horſes; that part is divided into ſeveral others, whereof ſome are External, and others Internal.</p>
                     <p>The External or outward parts of the Mouth, are firſt the <hi>LIPS,</hi> which are theſe thick skin that cover the teeth and gums.</p>

                     <p>The BEARD is the ſecond External part, it is the place where the curb reſteth and preſſeth the Horſe, when the bridle is drawn a little firm to bring in his head to it's right place; it is marked, 6.</p>
                     <p>The third part of the Mouth, is the TIP of the NOSE, which is as it were a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the upper lip, which covereth the teeth, and preſerveth them from cold and the injuries of the Air.</p>
                     <p>The fourth External part of the Mouth, is the CHIN, which is alſo a part of the under-lip which covereth the teeth; Marked 7.</p>
                     <p>In the Internal parts of the Mouth, people conſider firſt the BARRS, which are a part of the Gumms, but without any teeth, ſo that Nature ſeemeth to have appointed them as a place, for the mouth of the Bit to reſt upon.</p>
                     <p>The BARRS are propperly the very ridges or upper parts of the Gumms, betwixt the under Tuſhes and Grinders, for the outward ſides of them are always called the Gumms.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part is the TONGUE.</p>
                     <p>The third is the CHANNEL which is the hollow betwixt the two Barrs or nether jaw-bones, in which the Tongue is lodged.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is the PALAT, which is the Roof of the mouth, and the place where Horſes are commonly bled with a ſharp pointed horne, to refreſh and give them an Appetite.</p>
                     <p>The fifth and laſt is the TEETH which are of five kinds.</p>
                     <p>The firſt are the JAW-TEETH or Grinders, which are in Number Twenty four, <hi>viz,</hi> Twelve in the upper jaw, and as many below, with which the Horſe doth bruiſe and grind his provender by the Motion of the inferiour jaw, the ſuperior remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always immoveable and fixed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond are thoſe Small teeth which come forth before, when a Foal is about three Months old, and which he beginneth to caſt about two Years and a half thereafter, in the ſame order as they did firſt grow; they are therefore upon that account, called MILK or FOAL-TEETH.</p>
                     <p>The third are the TUSHES, which Mr. <hi>De La Brow</hi> calleth <hi>Eſchalions,</hi> thoſe are Teeth placed alone in the Barrs, betwixt the Fore-teeth and Grinders, one upon each ſide below, and as many above almoſt juſt oppoſite to them: Mares have ſeldom any of theſe Tuſhes, and when they have them they are but ſmall; it is alſo thought an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in thoſe which have them.</p>
                     <p>The fourth kind are thoſe which grow before in place of the Foal-teeth, and with which Horſes draw their Fodder, or cut their graſs when they are a grazing, they are called GATHERERS, and being ſix above and as many below, are divided into three kinds, <hi>viz</hi> the NIPPERS, the MIDDLE TEETH or SEPARATERS, and the OUTWARD or CORNER ones; The Nippers which are the two teeth in the midle both above and below, are thoſe which a Horſe firſt changeth, the middle Teeth or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraters, which are the two next the Nippers one upon each ſide of them both above and below, (and called Separaters becauſe they Separate the Nippers from the Corner teeth) are thoſe which change next, And the Outward and Corner ones, which are thoſe next the Tuſhes both above and below, and by which the age of a Horſe is known, are thoſe which he caſteth laſt; the age is alſo known by the Middle Teeth or Separaters; So the Number of the fore-teeth are twelve, ſix above and ſix below, by which it is eaſie to conclude, that a Horſe hath in all Fourty teeth, and a Mare but Thirty Six.</p>
                     <p>Having named and made known to you the parts of a Horſes Head, which are moſt apparent to our ſight, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ingadge my ſelf to deſcribe the Internal and moſt hidden parts thereof, which lye not ſo open and diſcovered to us, ſuch as thoſe of the brain and nerves, becauſe thoſe Perſons who have the curioſity to be more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in them, may receive that ſatisfaction from the Anatomy of the <hi>Sieur Ruiny,</hi> or Mr <hi>Snap's</hi> Anatomy of a Horſe in Engliſh, who hath treated very exactly of them,</p>
                     <p>The NECK is limited above by the CREST OR MANE, (which is that long hair which goeth from betwixt his Eares, all along the very Top or Ridge of the Creſt, down almoſt to the tip of his ſhoulders) and below by the Throat or wind-pipe: It is Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 8.8.</p>
                     <p>The WITHERS begin where the Mane endeth, and are joyned to, and end at the very top of the ſhoulder blades, they are Marked 9.</p>
                     <p>The SHOULDERS are below the Withers on each ſide, and in a manner incloſe the Breaſt, which is called by ſome the Counter, and deſcend to the place of their inſertion, or joyning to the ſhoulder bone: they are marked 10. 10. 10.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179659:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>The BREAST or COUNTER is below the wind-pipe, and betwixt the two ſhoulders before; Marked 11. 11.</p>
                     <p>The BACK or REINS, beginneth at the Withers, and taketh up as much length as a pad-ſalde of a reaſonable bigneſs will cover; It is Marked 12.13.</p>
                     <p>The LOYNS begin at that place where the hinder part of the Sadle reſteth, and although they be called the Loyns, yet properly they are nothing elſe but a continuation of the Back or Reins.</p>
                     <p>The RIBBS begin at the Back, and environ the Cheſt or Belly: they are marked 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</p>
                     <p>The BELLY is well enough known, it is oppoſite to the Back, and that part which People commonly ſtrike when they make uſe of their Spurrs.</p>
                     <p>The FLANKS are at the extremity of the Belly where the Ribbs are wanting, and below the Loyns: marked 15. 15.</p>
                     <p>The HANCHES begin at thoſe two Bones, which are at the upper part of the Flanks near to the Crupper, although the whole hinder part upon each ſide, from the Crupper to the Ham or Hough, goeth commonly under that name.</p>
                     <p>The CROUPE or upper part of the Buttocks, beginneth betwixt thoſe two abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Bones, and near the Loyns, and reacheth to the very Rump or Dock, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all that ſpace which is of a round or circular form, and where commonly the Crupper of the Sadle doth reſt.</p>
                     <p>The FORE-LEGS are compoſed of thoſe following parts.</p>
                     <p>The SHOULDER, or rather SHOULDER-BLADE which we mentioned before, marked 10. 10. 10. doth ſomewhat reſemble a Shoulder of Mutton, and is placed much after the ſame faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The SHOULDER-BONE, it is Bone which reacheth betwixt the Shoulder-blade, and Elbow-joynt, and is placed oppoſite to that part of the Belly, where the girths ly after a Horſe is ſadled, it is marked 16. When that Bone lyeth ſo cloſe to the body, that a Man findeth difficulty in putting his hand betwixt the Horſes body and <hi>Elbow,</hi> it is a deformity which always diſcovers, that the Horſe when riding will carry his Legs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: It is very fit to make this obſervation in Colts, and albeit this be not the proper place to mention it, yet leſt it might have eſcaped my memory, for lack of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſcourſe of it, I have here ſet it down.</p>
                     <p>The ARM or FORE-THIGH, reacheth from the Elbow Joint to the Knee, and beginneth the Foreleg; it is marked 17. 18. At that part where the Arm or Fore-thigh beginneth, upon the fore part of the Leg near to the Elbow joint, and a litle inclining towards the inſide, there lyeth a vein, called the Baſilick Vein (in French <hi>L'ars</hi> and by common Farriers the Plat-veine) in which Horſes are bled upon ſeveral occaſions: it is marked 17.</p>
                     <p>The KNEE is below the Arm or Fore Thigh, and juſt oppoſite to the ply or bending of the forelegs; it is marked 19 in the left leg of the figure plate 1ſt.</p>
                     <p>The SHANK is that part of the Fore leg, which is betwixt the Knee and ſecond joynt next to the foot, which is called the Fet-lock or Paſtern joynt, and is marked 19. 19.</p>
                     <p>The FET-LOCK or PASTERN joynt, is that joynt <hi>I</hi> juſt now mentioned, it is marked 20, and is the very next to the Foot.</p>
                     <p>The PASTERN, is the diſtance betwixt the foreſaid joynt and the Coronet of the hoof: it is marked 21.</p>
                     <p>The CORONET is that part round the very top of the Foot, where the hair groweth and falleth down upon the hoof; it is marked 22. Theſe are the names of all the parts belonging to the Fore-legs.</p>
                     <p>The FOOT conſiſts of the HOOF or COFFIN, which is all that Horn that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears when the Horſe has his foot ſet to the ground: it is marked 23, 24, 25.</p>
                     <p>The QUARTERS are the two ſides of the foot from 24 to 23.</p>
                     <p>The HEEL is the hinder part of the foot, and hath two ſides where the Quarters terminate; it is marked 23.</p>
                     <p>The TOE is the fore part of the foot, marked 25.</p>
                     <p>The foot muſt be taken up, that the parts following may be perceived.</p>
                     <p>The FRUSH or FROG, which is placed from the midle of the ſole towards the Heel upon both ſides, is a part more ſoft and more elevate than the reſt of the ſole, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates juſt at the Heel.</p>
                     <p>The SOLE is as it were a plate of horn, which environing the Fruſh covereth the whole bottom of the Foot, all people know it, becauſe when a ſhoe is right placed, it ſhould not at all reſt upon it, and but very ſeldom touch it.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:179659:26"/>
                     <p>The COFFIN BONE or LITTLE-FOOT, is that bone which is to the foot as a heart or kernel, It is quite ſurrounded and covered by the hoof, fruſh, and ſole, and is not perceived when even the Horſes ſole is quite taken out, being covered upon all ſides by a coat of fleſh, which hindreth the bone to appear.</p>
                     <p>It now remains that I name the parts of the hind-legs, whereof the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are, the upper bone of the hanch near to the Croup and upper part of the buttocks, called <hi>Os ilium,</hi> and marked 26.</p>
                     <p>The STIFFLE, otherwayes called the great Muſcle, is that part of the hind leg, which advanceth towards the Horſes belly as he is riding, it is marked 27, and is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous part to receive a blow or ſtroke upon.</p>
                     <p>The THIGH or GASKOIN begineth at the Stiffle, and reacheth to the ply or bending of the ham, and is contained betwixt the figures 27, and 29.</p>
                     <p>The HAM or HOUGH, is the ply or bending of the hind-leg marked 29. 29. and comprehendeth likewayes the poynt behind, and oppoſite to the ply, called the <hi>Hock,</hi> it is marked 30.</p>
                     <p>The PLY or bending of the Ham where the Selender cometh, is marked 29.</p>
                     <p>The part where the SPAVEN cometh, which is a little beneath the ply and in the inſide, is marked 31, and where the Excreſcence cometh, which is called in French <hi>Le jardon,</hi> and which is almoſt of the ſame nature with the <hi>Spaven,</hi> only that it is upon the out ſide, is the number 32.</p>
                     <p>From the Ham to the Paſtern joynt, is that part of the leg which in the fore-legs is called the SHANK, but in the hind the INSTEP, marked 33; the reſt of the parts to the very ſole, have the ſame denominations as in the fore legs, <hi>viz,</hi> Fet-clock joynt, Paſtern, Coronet, Hoof or Coffin, with the reſt of it's parts.</p>

                     <p>The goodneſs and beauty of this creature are almoſt inſeparable, ſo that being capable to know a well ſhap't Horſe, a man will come by degrees to know a good one; for, <hi>omne pulchrum eſt etiam bonum;</hi> and becauſe the definition which <hi>Cicero</hi> giveth of beauty is in my opinion pretty, and may very well anſwer my ſubject, I ſhall here ſet it down: <hi>pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo corporis apta compoſitione membrorum, cum coloris quadam ſuavitate movet oculos, &amp; delectat hoc ipſo, quod inter ſe omnes partes conſentiunt;</hi> if this or any other paſſages of latine in this book, appear ſtrange to ſome, let them comfort themſelves with this, that the not underſtanding of them will not make them a whit the leſs skilfull.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Head</hi> of a Horſe ſhould be ſmall, narrow, lean and dry;<note place="margin">of the Head in general.</note> every Horſe which hath a big and groſs head, may come eaſily becauſe of it's weight, to reſt and loll upon the bridle, and thereby in a journey incommode the hand of the Rider; beſides that he can never be very agreeable, and appear ſtately with a big Head, unleſs he have a very long and well turned neck, and place his Head well, in which caſe, he will not fail to make a pretty good appearance; the head is an eſſential part for beauty, without the good ſhapes of which a Horſe can never look well, for although all the reſt of his body be well ſhap't, yet if his Head be ſquare and groſs, he will appear a great deal worſe, and be leſs eſteemed, than if that imperfection lay in any other part of his body; as for the legs, their ſhape is far more important for goodneſs and ſervice, than beauty.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have their Heads groſs and charged with fleſh, are ſubject to the infirmities of the Eyes, but this is not to be underſtood of all big Heads, for a Horſe may have a Head big with bones, and but a very little fleſh upon it, ſo that he will not bemore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179659:27"/>in that caſe to ſuch defluxions, than if his Head were ſmaller; thoſe Heads which are overcharged with Fleſh, are thoſe we call fat or groſs Heads, and not the other, which although big yet are very lean and bony.</p>
                     <p>Now there being a particular ſhape required in every part of the Head, it will be fit to treat of them in order.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ears</hi> ſhould be little, narrow, ſtraight and hardy, and the whole conſiſtance of them thin and delicat, that is to ſay, the Cartilage whereof they are compoſed ſhould be no wayes thick, they ſhould be well placed, and to know how, there ſhould be but a little diſtance betwixt them; that is, they ſhould be placed upon the very top of the Head,<note place="margin">of the Ears.</note> and their poynts when ſtiled or prickt, ſhould be nearer to other than their roots; when a Horſe in galloping or travelling, carrieth his Eares pointed forwards as much as poſſible, then he is ſaid to have a bold, hardy, or brisk Ear; alſo when a Horſe travelleth he ſhould keep them firm, for if he marketh every ſtep he maketh by a motion of his Eares, then he will reſemble a Hog; when the Eares are low they are not right placed, and then they have them alſo ordinarly long and lolling, which are called <hi>Leave-eares,</hi> ſuch Horſes are commonly very durable, but however, upon this obſervation I would not buy a Horſe who hath his Eares ſo placed, becauſe although this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth him but little prejudice, yet he is nothing the better for it, and it is alſo very unbecoming.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> hath made a pretty enough remark upon the Eares of a Horſe, for he ſaith that by the motion of the Ears a man may judge of the intention and deſign, or courage of a Horſe, juſt as one doth a Dogs inclination by the motion of his Tail; the obſervation is good and holds for the moſt part, eſpecially in ill natur'd and vitious Horſes, for it may be very well obſerved by the motion of their Ears, if they deſign any deſperat Action, when a man requireth any thing of them they are not capable to perform, or when he conſtraineth them to do any thing by violence, or the force of blows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Forehead</hi> or Brow,<note place="margin">of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> ſhould be ſomewhat broad, ſome will have it not altogether flat but a little raiſed, becauſe they think it maketh a Horſe look more bold and ſtately, this ſhape reſembleth ſomewhat that of a Ram; my opinion is that a flat forehead is the moſt beautiful; theſe Horſes which are called Diſh fac'd (in French <hi>Camus</hi>) have the forepart of their head, from a little below their Eyes to the place where the Noſe-band of the bridle reſteth, a little low and hollow, ſuch Horſes are commonly durable, but very oft ſtubborn and ill natur'd.</p>
                     <p>All the forepart of the Head in general, ſhould be narrow, contrary to that in Men, for if it were too broad it would be an imperfection.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe ſhould have in his Fore head, that which we call a Feather, which is a natural frizling, or rather a turning of the Hair which formeth as it were a Center, from whence the reſt of the neighbouring Hair doth proceed; if he have two of them one near to the other, or that even touch other, the mark is ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p>Some people are ſo far miſtaken, as to believe, that when the Feather is below the Eyes it is a ſign of a weak ſight, and the contrary if it be above them; but experience will diſcover to you the uncertainty of this obſervation.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe be neither White, Dapled, nor approaching theſe colours, he ſhould have a Star or Blaze in his Fore-head, it is almoſt always a defect not only for the beauty, but alſo for the goodneſs of a Horſe when he is of any Dark colour, to be without one, as I ſhall ſhow you in it's proper place.<note place="margin">of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eye-pits</hi> or hollowes above the Eye browes, ſhould no wayes be too much ſunk, for if they are deep and hollow they are ugly, and the more they are ſunk, the more they make the Horſe appear to be old; nevertheleſs ſuch Horſes which come of an old Size or Stallion, have that deffect from their very youth, ſome more and others leſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eyes</hi> which are bright,<note place="margin">of the Eyes.</note> lively, full of fire, and pretty large and full, are moſt eſteemed; thoſe which are very big are not the beſt, neither ſhould they be too goggling, or ſtareing out of the Head, but equal with it, and have a large and full pupil or ground.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Eye ſhould be reſolute, impudent, and brisk; a Horſe to appear well, ſhould look to his object fixedly and with a kind of diſdain, and not look another way, for a brazen face and impudence do mightily become a Horſe; and in the Eye is alſo diſcovered his Inclination, Paſſion, Malice, Health, and Indiſpoſition; <hi>profecto in ocul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Littly hollow Eyes are ugly, and are called Pigs-eyes, it is true they prove ſometimes good, but they muſt be very narrowly conſidered.</p>
                     <p>When the Eyes are ſunk, or that the Eye-browes are too elevate, and as they were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179659:27"/>ſwelled, it is a ſign of vitiouſneſs and ill nature; ſuch kind of horſes have ordinarly a melancholy aſpect or countenance, but are commonly of great fatigue.</p>
                     <p>The Eye is the moſt tender and delicate part of the whole Body, being the laſt which is formed in the Womb, and the firſt that dyeth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jaw-bones,</hi> from top to bottom ſhould be narrow and lean, the diſtance betwixt them at the throat ſhould be pretty large and hollow, and ſo proportionably tapring to the very chin, that he may with the more eaſe place his Head when required; if the Jaw bone be too ſquare, that is, if there be too great diſtance betwixt the Eye, and that part of it which toucheth his neck, it is not only ugly and unbecoming, but alſo hindereth him to place his Head; alſo if the Jaw bones be ſquare or broad, and but a little diſtance betwixt them,<note place="margin">of the Jaw-bones.</note> ſo ſoon as the bridle is pulled to bring in his head to its moſt becoming poſture, the Bone meeting with his Neck will hinder him to place his Head, eſpecially if he have alſo with that imperfection a ſhort and thick neck; but becauſe this is not the propper place to diſcourſe of the inconveniencies which flow from a narrow jaw'd Horſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhall at preſent forbear ſaying any more of it.</p>
                     <p>From that part where the Noſe-band of the bridle reſteth,<note place="margin">of the Muzle.</note> which is ſomewhat below the middle of the Jaw-bone, and where it begineth to ſtraiten and become narrow, I ſay from that part to his very <hi>Muzle,</hi> he ſhould have nothing but skin and bone, ſo conſequently the ſmaller the better; and to make you the more eaſily comprehend how this part of a Horſes head ſhould be ſhap't, people commonly ſay that he ſhould drink out of a Bear-glaſs, by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of his <hi>Muzle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which will mightily contribute to the right ſhaping of this part in Colts, is to cauſe cut out the Nerves in that place, this doth extreamly dry up and macerat the lower parts of the Head, and alſo as ſome people ſay, preventeth the fat and thick growing of the neck.</p>
                     <p>Alſo that a Head may be the better ſhap't, it ſhould not be too long; the Heads which are too long are unbecoming, and are called Cymbal heads, (in French <hi>Teſles de vielle</hi>) That which doth moſt contribute to the good appearance and air of a Head, is a fine onſet, and exact ſituation when it is placed, for without that a well ſhap't one will appear but ugly, and with it an ill ſhap't will appear paſſible well and indifferent; a Horſe hath his head well placed, when it is ſet high, and that he can bring it in to it's natural ſituation, which is ſo, that all the fore-part of the head from the very brow to the noſe, be perpendicular to the ground, and that if there were a line and plummet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to it, it would hang equally alongſt it, and but juſt ſhave or raze it,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Noſtrils</hi> ſhould be large and extended, that ſo one may perceive the Vermilion,<note place="margin">of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</note> or red that is a little within them, eſpecially when the horſe ſneereth; the wideneſs of the Noſtrils doth not a little contribute, to that eaſineſs which a horſe ſhould have in breathing.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore upon this account, that the Spaniards and many others, cut up their horſes Noſtrils, to facilitate their Breathing in violent courſes, which when ſuch horſes are brought to <hi>France,</hi> is the cauſe of their being thought purſy or broken winded; but they are reputed ſuch, only by thoſe who have never been farther then their own Country Village or home, even although they have been born in or about <hi>Paris;</hi> but this cutting up of the Noſtrils beſides the eaſe it giveth in breathing, bringeth alſo another advantage alongſt with it, for it preventeth a horſes neighing, which is very convenient for ſuch perſons as go upon party, for then the neighing of their horſes cannot diſcover them, and I believe this is the chief reaſon why ſome horſes noſtrils are cut up, becauſe after it they neigh very rarely or not at all.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> almoſt all the curtail'd horſes have their Noſtrils cut up, although their Wind be abundantly good, but in <hi>France</hi> quite the contrary, for there they never cut up the Noſtrils, but of ſuch poor horſes as have their wind broke, and their Lungs quite ſpent and conſumed with purſyneſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mouth</hi> ſhould be indifferently well cloven, when it is too much,<note place="margin">of the Mouth.</note> there is a great difficulty ſo to bit a horſe, as that he do not ſwallow it as we ſay; And if he have a little Mouth and not enough cloven, then with difficulty can the Mouth of the Bit be right lodged in it, without either making him wrinkle his Lips, or the mouth of the Bit to reſt upon his Tuſhes; a reaſonable big Mouth is more uſeful for the goodneſs, then beauty of a horſe, as are alſo all the internal parts which doe not appear but when the Mouth is opened, nevertheleſs ſeing they are ſo eſſential to goodneſs, and are in place of a Rudder whereby to govern him right or wrong, I ſhall without ſtrictly tying my ſelf to ſet every thing in it's proper place, continue this matter,<note place="margin">of the Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> ſhould be ſmall, otherwayes it will be difficult to keep the bit from preſſing it, which making the tongue to extend over his barrs and cover them, will render his <hi>Appuy</hi> (as the French call it) or feeling of the preſſure of the bit dull, by hindering it's operation and effect upon the Barrs; for no liberty of any bit whatſoever is capable to contain theſe big Tongues, although the Channel or hollow betwixt the horſes Jaws, be abundantly deep and large: ſuch horſes as have very big Tongues, have ſeldom or never a good and ſenſible Mouth, becauſe the barrs are commonly flat and low.</p>
                     <p>A horſe ſhould have his <hi>Barrs</hi> ſharp ridged, and lean, for all the ſubjection which a horſe ſuffereth by the Bridle proceeding from the Barrs,<note place="margin">of the Barrs.</note> if they have not the above-mention'd qualities, they will be very little or not at all ſenſible, ſo that he can never have a good Mouth; for if they be flat, Round, and unſenſible, the Bit will not work it's effect, and to take hold of ſuch a horſe by his Tail, or by the Bridle to govern him, will prove much about one.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Channel</hi> or hollow betwixt the under-jaws,<note place="margin">of the Channel.</note> ſhould be large enough to contain his Tongue, that it be not preſſed with the mouth of the Bit, which ſhould alwayes have a little liberty in the midle of it.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Palate</hi> ſhould be lean, for if it be fat, that is, if it be full and high, ſo that it be equal almoſt with the extremities of his upper Teeth,<note place="margin">of the palat.</note> the leaſt height in the liberty of a Bit will incommode him, and if that part prove too ſenſible and tickliſh, the horſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the trouble and pain he receives from the liberty of the Bit, which hurteth him in that place, will either chack in the Bridle and be alwayes throwing up of his head, or otherwayes carry it too low, which beſides the deformity of it, will alſo very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the hand of the Rider.<note place="margin">of the Lips.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thin and little <hi>Lips</hi> contribute to a horſes having a good Mouth, but the contrary if they be large and thick.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Beard</hi> ſhould be neither flat,<note place="margin">of the Beard.</note> nor too high raiſed or pointed; if it have any of theſe imperfections it is ill ſhap't, and the Curb can never be made to reſt in it's right place; it ſhould alſo have but little fleſh upon it, and almoſt nothing but skin and bone, without any kind of Chops, hardneſs, or ſwelling; all theſe conditions make a good Mouth, whereas if the horſe had any of them in too great a degree or exceſs, his Mouth would prove bad by being too good: For example, if his Barrs were ſo ſenſible and ſharp, that they could not ſuffer the preſſure of the Bit, and conſequently that the horſe could not endure the pulling of the Bridle to keep him in ſubjection, this would be a great defect; 'tis true, the other parts particularly the Beard, have ſeldom that degree of ſenſibility and tenderneſs, although it is affirmed by the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in his book of riding, that the beard is the moſt ſenſible part of a horſes mouth.</p>
                     <p>The general qualifications of a good Mouth,<note place="margin">The general qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a good mouth.</note> are to have the feeling equal, firm, and gentle, the ſtop Eaſie and Firm, to have neither Swelling, Hurt, nor Bruiſe, to have the inward parts of the Mouth Freſh and full of froath; this Froath denoteth the right conſtitution of a horſe, who having his Mouth alwayes moiſt will not ſo eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat, and is a token that he delighteth in the bit, becauſe it maketh his Mouth to froath, and thereby giveth him pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>This is what is moſt conſiderable and neceſſary, for the knowledge of a beautifull and well ſhap't head: I ſhall not ſtop to tell you the number of bones whereof it is compoſed, nor their names, that being altogether of no uſe to a Gentleman, and but of very little even to a Farrier.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Neck,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">of the Neck.</note> it ſhould be lean and have but little fleſh upon it; and to be well ſhap't, it ſhould at it's outgoing from the Withers riſe with a ſlop upwards, diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees towards the head, and framing very near ſuch a compaſs or turn as doth the neck of a Swan; it ſhould be long, raiſed, lean, and thin towards the Mane, that is, it ſhould have but a little fleſh upon it near to the growing of the Mane, and the whole Neck conſidered in it's bulk, ſhould neither be too ſlender nor too much turned, becauſe either of theſe two extremes will give the horſe occaſion <hi>to arm himſelf,</hi> or reſt his chin upon his Counter.</p>
                     <p>The Barbs and Spaniſh horſes, which have their Necks thick and ſome-what charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fleſh, are the better of it, for they have their heads more fixed, their feeling of the bit better, and are not ſo ſubject to the throwing up of their heads; for my own part, I eſteem far more a Spaniſh horſe with ſome what of a thick Neck, than if he had it altogether ſmall and ſlender; beſides their Necks do not increaſe in thickneſs as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aged, but upon the contrary, the Neck of a Spaniſh horſe the older he groweth, the more it diminiſheth.</p>

                     <p>In mares, it is a good quality to have their Necks a little groſs and charged with fleſh, becauſe they have them for the moſt part but too thin and delicat, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a mare that hath ſome what of a thick Neck and raiſed Creſt, people ſay that ſhe hath a horſes Neck, which is a perfection in her, becauſe as I ſaid, they have almoſt all that defect of being too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Necks which are called <hi>Renverſed,</hi> or turn'd as it were up ſide down, are thoſe in with the Fleſh that ſhould be next the Mane, and give the Neck it's juſt turn in that part, is placed quite below and next to the Throat, which rendereth the Neck ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ill ſhap't, and is alſo the cauſe of the branches of the Bit's more readily reſting upon the Counter.</p>
                     <p>They are alſo called <hi>Deer-Necks,</hi> becauſe of the reſemblance to thoſe of Deers; or <hi>Cock thropled,</hi> in reſpect of their reſemblance to thoſe of Cocks:</p>
                     <p>There are alſo Necks which at the Creſt incline to one ſide, which by ſome are called <hi>Renverſed</hi> Necks, but very impropperly; for although the top of the Neck or Creſt hang and incline to one ſide, yet it is not of theſe People mean, when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a <hi>Renverſed</hi> Neck, for theſe incline only to one ſide, by reaſon of having too much Fleſh next to the Mane, but the other to wit the <hi>Renverſed,</hi> for having it below upon the nether part of the Neck, and near to the Throat.</p>
                     <p>To know if the neck be well ſhap't, you muſt with the bit bring in the Horſes head, and place it in it's moſt becoming poſture, and to be right ſhap't, the under part of it next to the Throat, ſhould not riſe perpendicularly, for thoſe which doe ſo are called <hi>falſe</hi> Necks, and the other which have that part of the Jaw-bone next to the Throat more backwards than the lower part of the ſaid Throat next to the Counter, are thoſe <hi>Renverſed</hi> or <hi>Cock-thropled</hi> Necks I juſt now diſcourſed of; ſo that a Neck which is well ſhap't, ſhould deſcend from the upper part of the Jaw-bone or onſet of the Head, all along ſlopwayes to the very Counter, that is, that part of the Neck next to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Jaw-bone, ſhould be more advanced than the lower part next to the breſt or Counter, this is what I underſtand by ſaying it ſhould deſcend ſlopwayes, and not altogether perpendicularly and ſtraight.<note place="margin">of the Mane.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hair</hi> of the <hi>Mane</hi> ſhould be long, thin, and fine, if it be frizled ſo much the better; large and thick Manes are a burthen to the Neck, and make it oft times incline and ly to one ſide, beſides that they are very unbecoming, and without an extraordinary care a perfect neſt for filth and duſt; large and thick Manes do alſo occaſion the Itch, in Horſes which are not carefully lookt after.</p>
                     <p>A well ſhap't neck, is yet more requiſite for the beatuy of a Horſe, than is a ſmall and ſlender head, for if a Horſe have his Neck very long, well raiſed, and turned, no doubt but he will appear comely, even although his head be a little ſquare and groſs and that he but place it right, eſpecially if with ſuch a Neck he have a well turn'd Buttock, and withall a good Horſe-man upon his Back.</p>

                        <hi>John Taquet</hi> who hath writ a diſcourſe of breeding Horſes, and how to know their ſhapes, which is pritty good for the time in which he lived, will have a Horſes neck to be thick and round, from the upper part of the Jaw-Bones to his very ſhoulders, to the end ſaith he, that he may not have the fault which the Turkiſh Horſes have, who but too eaſily ply their Necks, and who although he have it ſtiff and no ways flexible, yet becauſe of that ſhape of the Neck will turn with the more eaſe as he ſayeth; this reaſoning of his might have been good about two hundred years ago when this Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lived, but now a dayes we look upon it as a conſiderable imperfection in a Horſe, to have a very ſtiff neck, and which will not ply but with difficulty: <hi>I</hi> therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the ſaid <hi>John Taquet</hi> to the Duke of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> who will diſcover to him, that one of the greateſt imperfections a Horſe can have, is to be too Straight, Round, and Stiff necked.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have a well ſhap't Neck, although their Jaw-bones be ſome-what broad, yet if they bring in their head well, and that the fore part of it be narrow, they will make a very good figure; but although a Horſe have a very fine head, if he have not alſo with it a fine turned and well-ſhap't Neck, he will never appear handſome and comely.</p>
                     <p>A well ſhap't Neck, beſides the agreeableneſs and beauty it giveth to a Horſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes alſo very much to the other good qualities he ſhould have, in ſo far as it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him either light or heavy on the hand, according as it is fine or courſe;<note place="margin">of the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</note> but it is not the ſhape of the Neck alone, which maketh a Horſe light or heavy on the hand, but good or bad legs and feet, and ſtrong or weak Reins; however the Neck hath a great ſhare in it.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:179659:29"/>
                     <p>At the Lower part of the Neck upon the upper ſide, and at the end of the Mane, is the <hi>Withers,</hi> which ſhould be ſome what elevate and pritty long, becauſe it is a ſign of ſtrength and goodneſs; Moreover when the Withers are well raiſed, they keep the ſadle in its juſt place, and hinder it from coming forward upon his ſhoulders and Neck, which doth immediatly ſpoil and gall a Horſe; and if to keep it back you make uſe of a Crupper, it will not fail alſo to hurt him, becauſe of the great weight of the Sadle inclining, and conſequently of the Rider preſſing alwayes forwards.</p>
                     <p>The Withers although raiſed, ſhould not be too fleſhy, for then they will be much more ſubject to galling, and when hurt very difficult to cure; but if he have them lean, and but little more than skin and bone upon them, then they will be juſt ſo as a good and fine Horſe ſhould have them.<note place="margin">Of the Breaſt or Counter.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>A large and full <hi>Breaſt</hi> or <hi>Counter,</hi> is alwayes eſteemed in light or ſmall ſized Horſes, but in Dutch and Frizland Horſes they are commonly too large, which maketh them heavy; this is not to ſay but for Horſes deſigned for draught, large and broad Counters do very well, for they make them draw with the more eaſe, and the Harneſs galleth them leſs, but to ballance that advantage, ſuch Breaſts or Counters make them much more heavy, having by that means the perfect quality of a Cart-horſe, who the more he is tyed to the ground and the bigger, the better he is, and if with all this he have alſo a good wind, then he is moſt excellent, all horſes which have their mouths nought may draw in a Cart, but not in a Coach, where they muſt be light, and have a pritty good and ſenſible Mouth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Shoulders</hi> ſhould be of a middle ſize,<note place="margin">Of the Shoulders,</note> flat, and but little fleſh upon them, the joint next to the breaſt and the reſt of the whole ſhoulder very glib and moveable, a horſe which is charged with ſhoulders can never be agreeable to the Rider, for he will not only weary ſooner, but trip and ſtumble every minute; if a horſes ſhoulders be not very moveable, but ſtiff and unwieldy (which People call fixed or pegged ſhoulders,) then he will never have any nimbleneſs or agreeableneſs; but above all if with ſuch large ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he have a thick and big Neck, then his legs will be the ſooner ſpoylt and ruined, becauſe the weight of both the one and the other will very ſoon undoe the legs, which muſt ſupport that great burthen, as well in the Stable as upon Journey.</p>
                     <p>The ſhoulders are one of the parts of a horſe chiefly to be conſidered, becauſe in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horſe they ſhould be exactly lookt to, and you ſhould not take it for a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a horſe, that people ſay he is broad and large over all; it is a commendation indeed for the but tock, but if his ſhoulders are too large it is a great imperfection.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the directions I ſhall give you, to know when a horſe hath too large ſhoulders, you may obſerve this; a horſe which hath too great a diſtance betwixt his fore thighs, juſt at the top next to his ſhoulders, if he be a horſe of an ordinary ſize, and that that diſtance exceed half a foot, it is too much, and I can aſſure you ſuch a horſe is charged with ſhoulders, or hath them too big and large; he may have alſo too little a diſtance between them, and then he will be narrow breaſted or ſtrainted in the ſhoulders, which is a conſiderable fault, therefore a horſe of a middle ſize ſhould have about half a foot, or five inches diſtance between his fore-thighs, and when he is ſtanding ſtraight upon his limbs, there ſhould be a leſs diſtance between his feet, than betwixt his fore thighs near to the ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who ſeek after horſes which are moſt open before, (which is to have a great diſtance between the fore-thighs near to the ſhoulders) mightily deceive themſelves, for ſuch horſes have almoſt always but too large ſhoulders; it is not that I would adviſe you to chooſe them too narrow, becauſe ſuch horſes as have them are apt to ſtumble, and eaſily fall either in galloping or upon an ordinary pace, beſides that ſuch shoulders are unpleaſant to look to, and make a horſe appear ugly, narrow shoulder'd horſes do alſo commonly croſs their legs and cut themſelves in travelling; I shall ſpeak a great deal more of the knowledge of ſhoulders, when I diſcourſe of what is to be obſerved in buying a horſe.</p>
                     <p>A horſe should have <hi>double Reins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Reins of Back.</note> which is when he hath them a little more elevate upon each ſide of the back bone than upon it, and that paſſing you hand along it, you find it large, well furniſhed, and double, by the hollow that goeth all along the back-bone; the back ſhould be firme, and not at all hollow or bending from the the Withers to the Croupe, but ſtraight, and fashioned after the Reins of certain Mules.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe horſes which are hollow back't, are commonly light and have their Necks raiſed and high, but it is an imperfection; they are called Sadle-backed; and beſides that ſuch horſes have not ordinarly much ſtrength, it is alſo difficult ſo to fit a ſadle for them that it do not gall them, they have alſo commonly exceſſive big bellies, called
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179659:29"/>ſwallowed or gulped bellies, in French <hi>Ventres avalles,</hi> which render them very uncomely.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ribbs</hi> ſhould be circular and full, taking their tour or compaſs from the very back bone, to the end that thoſe parts which they contain, which are the Lungs and others, may be the more eaſily lodged, and that the Horſe may have alſo the better belly and fuller flank.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Belly</hi> ſhould be but of an ordinary bigneſs in middle ſized Horſes, but in Coach Horſes the larger the better, provyding they be not altogether gulped or ſwallowed, ſuch as thoſe of Cowes or of a Mare with foal, but that it be round and well incloſed within the Ribbs, and rather extending upon the ſides than dounwards.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Flanks</hi> ſhould be full, at the top of which upon each ſide,<note place="margin">Of the Flanks.</note> there ſhould be a kind of frizour of the hair, or feather as we call it, the nearer thoſe feathers approach one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other upon the top near to the loyns, ſo much the better, but if they be as it were within view of other, then the mark is excellent.</p>
                     <p>The diſtance between the laſt Rib and Haunch bone, which is propperly the Flank, ſhould be but ſhort; which we terme well coupled. The Horſes which are shorteſt in that place, are longeſt of having their flanks ruined or ſpoilt by exceſſive labour, but the contrary is obſerved in thoſe who have it long.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Croupe</hi> should be large and round, and ſo turned,<note place="margin">Of the croupe.</note> that the tops of the two haunch bones be not within view of other; the greater diſtance there is between thoſe two bones, the better is the mark, and the Croupe ſo much the finer and larger, but it is an imperfection if thoſe two bones appear too high, and then a Horſe is called horn-hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by ſuch as have but ordinary skill; for my own part I never met with a horn-hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Horſe, becauſe I make all thoſe luſty and plump which People call ſo, and when they are thus in good caſe, thoſe high bones do not more appear, 'tis true I have had more difficulty in making ſome fat and plump than others, becauſe they had thoſe two bones extremely elevate, and even in view of other, but at laſt I made them abundantly luſty, and then they were no more that which People call horn-hipped.</p>
                     <p>The Croupe ſhould not be ſtraight nor ſwallowed up next to the tail, but take it's tour and compaſs from the haunch bones, to the very dock or onſet of the tail, and ſhould be divided in two by a hollow or channel, going from between the two haunch bones al along to the very dock.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tail</hi> ſhould be firme, ſtrong, immoveable, and well furniſhed with hair;<note place="margin">of the Tail.</note> the Dock ſhould be big, ſtiff, and placed pritty high, thoſe who have it too low ſet have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom good Reins, and never a beautyfull Croupe; ſome Horſes have it too high ſet, which maketh their buttocks appear poynted, and of the ſhape of a plum, which is very unbecomeing; thoſe Horſes which have but very little hair upon their tails are called Rat-tail'd, and paſs commonly for good ones, but this one mark is not ſufficient to make a Horſe be eſteemed, becauſe to be a good one their are a great many more required; having gone through all the parts of a Horſes body, we muſt now come to his for-legs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fore-legs</hi> have ſeverall parts, and each of them their particular beauty and ſhape;<note place="margin">of the fore-thighs.</note> the arm or fore-thigh ſhould be large and Nervous, and if the muſcle marked 17 below the Baſilick veine, <hi>in French L' ars,</hi> be big, nervous, and fleſhy, ſo much the better, for although the ſhank from the knee to the paſtern joynt be ſmall, yet if his fore thigh be ſtrong, and that the above mentioned Muſcle be large, it will in ſome meaſure ſupply the defect of the ſhank.</p>
                     <p>Another obſervation relateing to the fore-thigh, is that it ſhould be pritty long, which wll make the Horſe the longer a wearying upon travell, becauſe the greateſt ſtrength of the leg lying in the fore-thigh, and the leaſt in the ſhank and other parts, it is to be preſumed that the part which is moſt weak being ſhorteſt, it will be in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to endure fatigue, but then the leg will not have ſo gracefull a motion, that is to ſay, ſo fine and delicat a ply and movement in ſtepping and galloping; this great motion, is that which maketh Horſes deſigned for hunting and Courſing, or even for Iourneying, to become ſooner wearied, but then it is very gracfull and much eſteemed for the mannage.</p>
                     <p>For in Mannag'd Horſes it is quite contrary, becauſe the ſhorter the fore-thighs or arms are, ſo much the better, and one of the moſt becomeing things in a mannaged Horſe, is to have a ſtately and gracefull motion with his fore-legs, now the ſhorter the fore-thighs are, the greater motion the legs make, which is very much to be taken notice to in buying of Colts, or Barbs newly come over which people deſign for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, becauſe no Horſe which wanteth this comely movement, can be agreable and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to thoſe who behold him in his mannage.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:179659:30"/>
                     <p>For ſuch Horſes there is required a great deal of art, with an extraordinary patience, the moſt part of them having no natural diſpoſition to it; for Horſes wanting a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full motion of their legs, although well mannaged, yet are very difficult to be kept juſt and in order, that is, to be made to go well.</p>
                     <p>The larger and broader the <hi>Shank</hi> is, or that part of the fore-leg from the knee to the paſtern joynt, ſo much the better; you will know when it is ſo, by the back-ſinew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance from the bone, or pritty well ſeparate from it, and having no kind of ſwelling or humor betwixt it and the bone, which may cauſe the leg to appear round;<note place="margin">of the shank.</note> Horſes which have a ſmall back-ſinew, have it almoſt alwayes cloſe upon the bone, and are ſubject to become round legged, people call ſuch legs, <hi>Ox legs,</hi> becauſe of their reſemblance to thoſe of Oxen.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knee</hi> ſhould be flat and large,<note place="margin">of the Knee.</note> without any ſwelling or roundneſs upon the top of it, and the ſhank as I ſaid, broad, flat, and ſhort, the back-ſinew well detatched from it; and near to the paſtern joynt ſhould be perceived the two little bones which lye upon each ſide of the ſhank bone, but theſe little bones do but ſeldom appear except in ſmall ſized Horſes, ſuch as Barbs and Spaniſh Horſes; the back-ſinews ſhould be alſo firme and large without any hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Back-ſinews are the moſt conſiderable parts of a Horſes legs, thoſe which are big and without any ſwelling are the beſt, becauſe ſuch legs as have them ſmall will be ſoon ſpoylt, the Horſe will eaſily halt, and upon the leaſt travell or fatigue, the leg will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come round and gourded, which as it is an imperfection in the ſhape, ſo far more in the goodneſs of a leg.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>paſterne joynt</hi> ſhould be proportionably large to the ſize of the Horſe,<note place="margin">of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern joynt and paſtern</note> broad, and without any ſwelling or ſorrance, haveing a little tuft of hair behind called the fet-lock, in french <hi>Le Fanon.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Paſterne</hi> ſhould be ſhort, eſpecially in middle ſized Horſes; the paſterns which are too long, are weak and cannot endure travell, Horſes which have them are called long joynted; Large and big Horſes which have too ſhort paſterns become ſoon <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Upon the the contrary there are Barbs, and Horſes whoſe Sires and Dams are of different countreyes, called in french <hi>Chevaux Echappez</hi> that are extreamly long paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern'd, ſo that in travelling their paſtern joynts do almoſt touch the ground, which is a ſign of great weakneſs, at leaſt in that part, if it be not alſo univerſal.</p>
                     <p>This imperfection of being long joynted, is of more conſequence againſt the goodneſs than beauty of a Horſe, and proceeds commonly form an old ſtallion, therefore a man ſhould never make choiſe of a middle ſized Horſe for a ſtallion, which is long joynted.<note place="margin">of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet and hoof.</note>

                     <p>A Horſe ſhould alſo ſtand firme upon his legs, which will contribute ſome-what to his comelineſs, and when he ſtandeth ſtill in one place, their ſhould be a greater diſtance between the upper parts of his two fore-thighs, than between his feet, that is, the diſtance betwixt the fore-legs, ſhould enlarge by degrees from the feet to the breaſt or Counter, and by this meanes a Horſe will be more firme upon his Limbs, and alſo appear more beautyfull.</p>

                     <p>A horſe who hath good feet before, hath ſeldome bad ones behind, except by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; therefore people look to the hind feet but ſlightly, and (as the French ſay) <hi>En paſſant.</hi>

                     <p>Commonly the hind-feet are good, when the fore feet are weak and tender, the <hi>Seimes</hi> as the french call them, which are rents or clifts in the quarters of the feet from the Coronet to the ſhoe, are almoſt the only Sorrances which the hind-feet are ſubject to, except ſometimes the Crown-Scab upon the coronet, the figg in the ſole, and the hornfruſh and brittle.</p>
                     <p>There remaines as yet one very viſible imperfection to be conſidered, which is when Horſes are ſet too high upon their legs, that is, when their legs are longer than the proportion of their bodies requireth, whereby not only their beauty but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Antients have determined a meaſure for them, although in my opinion there is no other required than that which is given by ones eye, ſeing any perſon who is a little accuſtomed to look to Horſes, will eaſily know if a Horſes body be too high ſet, or have <hi>trop de jour</hi> as the french term it: but to ſatisfie the Curious in this point, they may take a threed and meaſure from the Withers to his elbow, and what ever length that is, he ſhould have the ſame diſtance betwixt the Elbow and lower part of his heel, for if he have more, his legs will be too long; many people meaſure their Colts when a year old, and take the diſtance from the lower part of the heel to their elbow, and ſay that their body will alwayes grow, untill there be the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between their Elbow and Withers, as there was betwixt the elbow and lower part of the heel; becauſe ſay they, at a year old a Colt hath his legs as long as ever, which I have indeed obſerved in ſome, but not in all: The Duke of New-Caſtle in his book of Horſe-manſhip, condemnes mightily this obſervation, and in my opinion not without good ground.</p>

                     <p>I do with them acknowledge, that thoſe who imitate not the Antients have not that juſtneſs and skill, eſpecially in what relateth to the delineation and exact ſhaping of humane bodies, but as to the matter of Horſes, although Antients have obſerved the juſt delineation of many parts, yet they have failed in ſome, and to give you a few inſtunces of it, I ſhall diſcourſe of the <hi>Attitude</hi> or ſituation, which is properly the poſtures in which they put the Horſes they repreſent, and I ſay that the moſt part of the poſtures they have given to Horſes, ſhould not be imitate in this age wherein we live.</p>
                     <p>The Horſes of the Antients were no wayes mannaged, and but under little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, yea they were more oddly bridled, than the Cravats and Turkiſh Horſes are in theſe countreyes, and all the actions they repreſented them performing under a man, appeared deſperate and furious, becauſe the Riders themſelves did not know what to require of them, and the Horſes being full of mettal and Choler, performed ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as did rather diſcover their being tranſported, and in a kind of fury, than ſhow their obedience and ſubjection to the will of the Rider.</p>
                     <p>Their Bits which were badly choſen, and capable to render a Horſe deſperate, might contribute much to it, eſpecially the Riders being not at all Horſemen; and the horſes having alſo no ſadles, but only a kind of cloath or houſe upon them, did ſo incommode their Riders, that they could ſcarce keep their backs, and then Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them which their heels and ſpurrs, they cauſed their horſes, ſome of which were extraordinary well ſhapt and vigorous, to perform ſuch actions as would appear to us now a dayes ſo ſtrange and extravagant, that we could ſcarce endure to look to them being ſo diſorderly and contrary to all the Rules of art.</p>
                     <p>Now the modern Painters and Sculptors, endeavour to imitate thoſe ugly, fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vitious actions, becauſe the Ancients have repreſented them; t'is true, in them it was pardonable, for they knew none better, in which to cauſe their horſes appear either more lively or vigorous, but now that the art of rideing is brought to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that people have fallen upon methods to reduce horſes, and bring them under
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179659:31"/>a perfect ſubjection and obedience, and to have no other will ſave that of their Riders, it is known more and more, that the actions of obedience wherewith a Horſe is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, cauſe him performe Ayres a great dale more fine, and infinitly more agreeable to the ſoectators; and in thoſe actions or Ayres, there appears ſuch a harmony and beauty, that what ever they do contrary to them is diſpleasing, and cannot be endured.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, ſince the art of bitting Horſes is arrived at it's greateſt perfection, the bits which are made uſe of now a dayes, beſides that they place a Horſes head right, give alſo his neck the moſt beautifull turne and ſituation it is capable of, without force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to open his mouth as the bits of the Antients did, which cut and ſpoylt the Barrs, and were of no other uſe but to torment a Horſe, and make him ſhow a pair of wide frightfull Jawes, for in the very inſtant that a Horſe openeth his mouth, the action and figure it maketh are ſo diſpleaſing, that people ſay he openeth his jawes out of deriſion and contempt; Nevertheleſs all the Horſes repreſented by the Antients, either in Imboſsed metal or flat painting, do open their mouths after ſuch an Extraordinary manner, that it is one of the moſt horrible and chocking ſights, in fine the moſt unpleaſant and unbecoming action, that a Horſe can poſſibly performe under a man.</p>
                     <p>All this being conſidered, I ask any man of ſenſe if we ſhould imitate the Antients in thoſe things, wherein they were wrong and erred; if they have only repreſented Horſes in poſtures of rage and deſpair, they could not do otherwayes, becauſe they knew no better; but now a dayes to repreſent under a King, great Prince, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of an army, a Horſe in ſuch actions of fury and tranſport, would be enough to make the Spectators believe, that either the Rider knowes not to Govern him, or that the Horſe is altogether diſobedient, which would be thought ridiculous for any to imagine, in this age wherein we live; becauſe perſons of that condition and quality, mount no Horſes but ſuch as are very well adjuſted, and under a perfect ſubjection, having their heads and necks exactly well placed, and performing ſome fine <hi>Peſade</hi> or becomeing <hi>Paſſage,</hi> which make them appear brisk and ſtately, and without ſeeming in the leaſt to deny, that perfect obedience which they ſhould give to their Riders.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps people may anſwer to this, that a Horſe repreſented in ſuch an obedient poſture, will appear no ways gracefull, and that unleſs he be repreſented performing ſome extraordinary action, which may diſcover his mettle and be a token of his Courage, he will appear altogether dull and without life; but there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in repreſentations, that is, to put a Horſe in ſuch a poſture as may make him appear full of Courage, extraordinary Nervous, and with a kind of fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtayedneſs in his motions, and to paint him in Deſpair and rage as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have done; and I believe I am not much deceived, that if a Horſe be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a ſtately carriage, and well upon his Haunches, performing a beautifull <hi>Peſade</hi> or <hi>Corvet,</hi> with a good motion of his arms or forethighs, which will diſcover that he hath a gracefull movement, and if withall, his muſcles, nerves and Veins, be marked in their due places, I ſay ſuch a Horſe will certainly appear a thouſand times more lively and beautifull, and alſo more gracefull and agreeable in ſuch a poſture, than thoſe of the Antients in their extravagant actions, having their mouths open, their necks Renverſed, and endeavouring to force the hand of the Rider.</p>
                     <p>The Antients have placed the head wrong, in moſt part of the deſigns they have left us of Horſes, either in paint or ſculpture; for the forepart of the head ſhould ſtand alwayes perpendicular or plum, whatever poſture the body of the Horſe be in which is beneath the Rider, therefore to have the Noſe extended in galloping or other wayes, as they have repreſented them, is a conſiderable errour; the neck in the upper part of it next to the mane, ſhould make a Tour very near like that of a Swans neck, it ſhould be thinneſt towards the mane, and the under part ſhould ſlop towards the breaſt or Counter, that is, that part of the throat next to his nether jaws, ſhould be four inches more advanced than that part of it next his Counter, for if the Throat ſtand perpendicular it is falſe, and if it be further back at the onſet of the head, then it is at his Counter, then it is that we call <hi>Deer-necked</hi> or <hi>Cock-thropled,</hi> which is an imperfection the Antients have very wrongouſly given to all their Horſes, repreſented either in painting, carv'd work, or imboſſed metal; as alſo to make the Creſt, which is the part out of which the mane groweth, too thick and groſs, eſpecially betwixt the eares, where it maketh that part too broad, is a fault; for the neck ſhould be almoſt flat upon each ſide of the mane, and but a little fleſh upon it.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:179659:32"/>
                     <p>For the Eares, it is indeed becoming to have their points placed nearer other than their roots, to make them appear more hardy and brisk, but if they are too much cloſed at the points as many painters repreſent them, then they are wrong, which I could eaſily make appear, would it not prove too tedious to conſume time upon ſo ſmall a matter; the Eares ſhould be placed on the very upper part of the head, and pretty near to one another.</p>
                     <p>For the ſhoulders there is a great debate anent them; the ſculptors ſay that the biggeſt and largeſt are the moſt beautifull; t'is true they are the beſt for draught Horſes, but if ſadle Horles had their ſhoulders large, fleſhy, and broad, as the painters affect to repreſent them, they would be fit only for a Cart, for they would be heavie and fixed to the ground, which is properly what they call in french <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne grande Carogne,</hi> or great Carion; but for this they ſay, that to make a Horſe ſeem active his Muſcles muſt appear, and if he be not very full in the ſhoulders, and have alſo the joynt at the inſertion of the ſhoulder bone with the blade, much advanced, they cannot be decerned, and ſo he will never appear with any kind of life or vigour; I again man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the quite contrary, that in a full and large ſhoulder charged with fleſh, the Muſcles will appear but little or not at all; do they appear in a very groſs or corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man? they will appear juſt as little in ſuch large and fleſhy ſhoulders, and I aſſure you, that in a flat ſhoulder with little fleſh, and which hath in a manner nothing upon it but skin and bone, which is as the ſhoulder of a fine and will ſhapt Horſe ſhould be, the Muſcles, and Nerves will all appear as if they were natural; whereas if the Nerves and Muſcles be repreſented in a large and round ſhoulder, they will be contrary to Nature and perhaps wrong placed, becauſe they cannot be well perceived in any Horſe who hath his ſhoulders ſo full and fleſhy.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, repreſenting thoſe big ſhoulders with the joint which toucheth the poitrall of the ſadle, much advanced, there is ſuch a diſtance and breadth in the Counter of the Horſe, that he is as full and broad in the ſhoulders as in the Croupe, and that is alſo another fault accompanying the Errours of the Painters and Sculptors, for although a Horſe to be well ſhapt, ſhould be open and a little full before, yet if he be too much it is an imperfection, and quality only fit for a Cart Horſe; for the fore parts of a Horſes ſhoulders, that is, the diſtance which is between the one and the other, ſhould be only a little more than half the breadth of his hinder quarter, or hauuches, ſo that when people ſpeak of a well ſhapt Horſe, they ſay he is full and broad in the Croupe but not in the Shoulders, that is to ſay, the diſtance between them ſhould be but ſmall, and therefore the Shoulders of an exact ſhapt Horſe, are compared to thoſe of a Hare; judge then if Painters have reaſon to make ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Shoulders, when they deſign to repreſent a brave and beautiful horſe.</p>
                     <p>That Muſcle which is upon the inſide of the fore thigh and below the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cannot be repreſented too full and fleſhy, for ſuch a ſhape becomes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely; the reſt of the fore-thigh ſhould be large, the Nerves and Muſcles well placed, and the knees big and pretty flat; ſome paintets place Muſcles upon them: I have ſeen in horſes repreſented in <hi>Relievo</hi> or caſt Metal, to the number of three placed upon the flat of the knee, which is contrary to Nature, for horſes have never any in that part: as for the paſtern joynts of the fore-legs, they make them commonly too big; people to look to them would take them to be ſwelled or gourded, their paſterns too long, and to compleat all a very big foot which is diſproportionable to the leg, and conſequently a groſs imperfection; for the thighs they make them too lean; you will ſee in ſome of their horſes a large Croupe, and fleſhy haunches, Which is very right, but then they give them lean and ſlender thighs, which is wrong; the Muſcles which are upon the outſides of them ſhould be large and fleſhy, and the whole thighs well furniſh'd: one needs not go far to diſcover this fault in a horſe repreſented in imboſſed Metal, which is much eſteemed and with reaſon, for it is done by an excellent Workman; theſe faults of the thigh and knee which I have remarked, are there all Viſible.</p>
                     <p>When a horſe is upon his haunches, makeing a <hi>Corvet</hi> or <hi>peſade,</hi> the whole weight of his body reſteth upon his Hams, ſo that truly in that caſe all the Nerves, Muſcles and Veins, ſhould appear; but as a horſe does not continue long in that action, that ſo he may be exactly deſigned, the Painters in ſtead of placeing thoſe heights and hollows where they ſhould be according to nature, make too many of them, and repreſent a Ham full of Courbs, Jardons, or Spavens, and alſo make large plyes or folds in that part of the Ham where the Sellender cometh, to the number of two or three, which is abſolutly contrary to the order of Nature, for ſuch large folds are called wreaths or rouls, in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179659:32"/>french <hi>des Bourlets</hi> which are viſible marks of a horſe which hath been much uſed; and if a Horſe have ſuch Swellings in the bending of his Hams, he would not be ſound enough to be repreſented in imboſſed work; yea although he ſhould be beautifull enough for that purpoſe, yet at leaſt his faults ſhould not be imitated, which are theſe wreaths or <hi>Bourlets</hi> which he hath in his Hams: The Ham or hough ſhould be large, broad, lean, and very hollow, ſo that if people make Swellings where there ſhould be none, in place of repreſenting a beautifull Horſe, they will diſcover one Cripple and Maimed.</p>
                     <p>As for the paſtern joynts of the hind legs, of theſe Horſes which the Painters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent upon their haunches, they make them and the Inſteps all of one peice as it were, and the paſtern the ſame, as if the horſe had no ply in his paſtern joynt, which can no wayes be; for every Horſe that performeth any motion upon his baunches, for example a <hi>Corvet;</hi> as the paſtern joynts of the hind legs are thereby much ſtreſſed, and that all the weight of his body reſteth upon them, they muſt of neceſſity ply and bend, and that ſo very much, that the back parts of the paſtern joynts touch almoſt the ground, which is what may be dayly ſeen in the Academies of riding; yet the Sculptors never fail to repreſent the Inſiep of the hind leg, paſtern joynt and paſtern, all in a ſtraight line as if they were of one peice, like to the leg of a dog, which is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; almoſt all the Horſes which I have ſeen either painted or carved in my time, had this fault.</p>
                     <p>The painters may have this to retort upon me, that in the repreſentation of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall humane body, they aſſiſt nature as one may ſay, becauſe the moſt perfectly ſhapt bodies that they make choice of for a model, have ſome parts ſo formed, that if they were repreſented according to nature, they would be found no wayes agreeable, and people would judge them defective; <hi>I</hi> grant this is true, but then they do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men which are exactly well ſhap't, have all the parts of their body ſo framed as they repreſent them; upon the contrary Horſes are ſeldom found perfectly well ſhapt, neither are the moſt beautifull ſo in all their particular members; and therefore nature ſhould only be imitated in that wherein ſhe is right and beautifull, but not wherein ſhe is deformed, which is what the Painters and Sculptors do: for to enlarge a Horſes ſhoulders, and to give him Muſcles where he ſhould have none, is to make him fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and monſtruous, and of a beautifull and well ſhapt Horſe, to make one fit only for a Cart.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe Gentlemen, I mean the Painters and Sculptors, read what I have been ſaying, I believe they will confeſs that antiquity ſhould only be imitated in that wherein it is right, and not where it is defective; for it's being Antient maketh it no leſs an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and errour: Many people very dextrous in their art, to whom I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated theſe reaſons, have agreed with me in what I ſaid. I know very well that what the Greeks have left us of raiſed and carved work in monuments, are moſt exactmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels for Sculpture and Painting, but it is not the ſame in reſpect to the poſtures wherein they put their Horſes; and that which Monſieur <hi>Mignar</hi> hath painted under the King the year he took <hi>Araſtrick,</hi> and which is in one of the Galleries of <hi>Verſatles,</hi> is the moſt beautifull, the beſt deſigned, and the moſt exactly ſhapt that hath ever yet appeared, for it is placed according to the rules of Horſemanſhip, and is in truth juſt as it ought to be; for it is conform to beautifull nature, and every part of it ſo exactly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately deſigned, that it may for ever ſerve as a model for all the Painters, by which they may ſtudy and learn how a beautifull Horſe ſhould be ſhapt; for let any man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it critically and to the outmoſt rigour, but without prejudice or humour, and he muſt acknowledge, that there hath never as yet appeared one more perfect.</p>
                     <p>This digreſſion is a little too long for an impatient reader, who very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himſelf, whether Horſes be well or ill deſign'd and painted, for providing he have good ones himſelfe he is ſatisfied; perhaps he is in the right on't, and it is probable the threed of my diſcourſe hath inſenſibly drawn me on; but I entreat him to conſider my intention and deſign, and if that will not ſatisfie him, I muſt be ſo plain as to tell him, that I have had a great dale more trouble in writing, than he in reading of it, eſpecially not being obliged to it, as I advertiſed him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, and ſo we are quits.</p>
                     <p>I am now going to diſcourſe of the goodneſs of a Horſe, and of his faults and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and I dare promiſe that every one who can underſtand what I am going to write, may call himſelf skilful in this matter: experienc will teach him, that a man may eaſily arrive at this knowledge, if he carefuly apply himſelf to underſtand, what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the following Chapters; it is not enough to read them over once or twice, he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179659:33"/>muſt underſtand them; yea after he hath read them go viſit and conſider Horſes, and obſerve all the particulars which have been taken notice of; it is true there is required ſomewhat of pains and application to do this, and it is a kind of trouble to thoſe who do not delight in it, which perſons may aſſure themſelves, that without having a liking for Horſes, they ſhall but with difficulty become knowing and skilful.</p>

                     <p>For both may judge of the ſoundneſs of a Horſe; that is, that the leaſt lameneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection ſhall not eſcape any of them, but then the one will judge of the agreeableneſs and eaſineſs, of the united and equal ſtrength which is found in his Actions, or of a rude knit and uneaſy force; in fine, the one will deſcern that the Horſe is fit for a perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the other will only know, that he is a good ſound Horſe and without fault, but will not be able to penetrat farther, and this is what cannot but with great difficulty be taught by writ; there is required for it a long practice and a nice fancy; I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all I know of it which is but little, yea it is alſo difficult to arrive at that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licateneſs of Knowledge, without being a Horſeman, having a great experience, and having alſo Rid a great many Horſes.</p>

                     <p>A Horſe hath four kinds of Teeth, his age is known by ſome of them, and others ſerve to grind the provender where with he ſubſiſteth; the firſt which grow are the <hi>Feal-Teeth,</hi> which come forth a few months after he is foaled, theſe are little and very Whyte, not at all hollow, and are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the reſt; the ſecond are the Tuſhes, and the third are theſe Teeth, which grow in place of the Foal-teeth after they are caſt, of which the outward ones, or thoſe next the corners ſhow the age; theſe Corner teeth are placed next to the Tuſhes, and upon the out ſides of the fore-teeth both above and below: ſome people in conſidering a Horſes Age look to the upper teeth, but then it is only when the Horſe is pretty Aged, and that there can be nothing known by theſe below.</p>
                     <p>A little before a Horſe hath attained to the Age of thirty Months, which is two years and a half, he hath twelve Foal-teeth in the fore part of his mouth, ſix above and ſix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (I do not hear ſpeak of his Chop-teeth or Grinders) at thirty Months or a little after, four of theſe Foal-teeth fall, two above and two below in the very middle; in ſome Horſes they do not fall till they have three years, the obſervation not being ſo exact and juſt as to Anſwer always thirty Months: there groweth then in the place of theſe four Foal-teeth which fell, four others which are called Nippers or Gatherers, they are thoſe in the middle, and with which a Horſe cutteth his graſs when he is a grazing; you muſt remark that the Teeth which come in place of the Foal-teeth are a great deal bigger, ſtronger, and larger than them, alſo they are theſe which a Horſe keepeth all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, ſeing he never changeth them more.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe hath changed but two Teeth above and two below, which Teeth are as I ſaid called Gatherers, then it is certain that he is at moſt but three years old, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but thirty Months which is only two years and a half.</p>
                     <p>At three years and a half, but rarely at four, there falleth other four Foal-teeth, two above and two below, whereof one upon each ſide of the Gatherers both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and in their places come four others, very near as big, large, and ſtrong, as the Gatherers, which are called Separaters, becauſe they ſeparate the Gatherers from the outward or Corner Teeth; when a Horſe hath changed four Teeth above and as many below, then he may be ſaid to have three years and a half, and very oft four.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth after this to a horſe, only four Foal-teeth in the Corners, which he changeth moſt commonly at four years and a half; you now ſee after what order a horſe changeth his Teeth, to wit four teeth at two years and a half, which is thirty Months, and are called Gatherers; four at three years and a half, which are thoſe between the Gatherers and Corner-teeth, called Separaters; and at four years and a half the outward or Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth: to begin therefore to know the age of a horſe exactly by the Teeth, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179659:34"/>to keep in your memory, two years and a half, three years and a half, and four years and a half; that is to ſay, when a horſe hath caſt but two Teeth above and as many below, that then he hath but two years and a half, if he have changed four above and as many below, that he hath three years and a half, and that if he have caſt all ſix both above and below, which is to have them all changed, that then he has four years and a half.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved that the Corner-teeth in the upper Gums, are caſt before theſe in the nether, and that upon the contrary the Tuſhes grow out in the under Gums, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe in the upper, and oftimes Horſes are very ſick when the Tuſhes of the Upper-Gums cut, but are never ſo when theſe below come forth; there are alſo ſome Horſes which have no Foal-teeth, they being already all changed, and whoſe Tuſhes neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have not as yet cut the Upper-gums, although they have changed their Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth, which are theſe of the Fore-teeth by which the age of a Horſe is beſt known.</p>
                     <p>It remains now to diſcourſe of the Tuſhes, which are not as the other Teeth, for they are preceeded by no Foal-teeth in the places where they come, but grow up when a Horſe is about three years and a half old; the obſervations which are taken from the Tuſhes, are the abſolutly moſt certain for the knowing of a Horſes age, and ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of in their proper place.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Gatherers and Separaters have peirced or cut the Gums, they make all their growth in fifteen days, but the Corner teeth do not grow ſo ſuddenly, yet that doth not hinder but that at their very firſt appearing and coming out, they are as thick and broad as the other, but they are no higher than the thickneſs of a Crown peice, and very ſharp and hollow; it may ſometimes fall out that the Corner-teeth, will appear almoſt at the ſame very time with the Tuſhes, ſometimes before them, but moſt frequently after, for it is moſt ordinary for the Tuſhes to grow up before the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-teeth are caſt.</p>
                     <p>I obſerved in Germany (the fatigue of the War having killed a great many Horſes) that the Horſe Courſers did pull out their Horſes Foal-teeth at three years old, to force nature to produce ſooner Teeth of a bigger ſize; and becauſe a Horſe of three years is not fit for the Wars, and only begins to be ſerviceable at four or five, they, that they might the better ſell or put them off, made uſe of this trick and cunning to make them appear of the age of four or five, which is an age in which the German Horſes are as good and capable to ſerve, as if they were full eight; but it is not the ſame in France, for the Horſes there of four years old are but very unfit for the Wars.</p>
                     <p>It is very rare to find a Mare who hath Tuſhes, and when they have them they are a great dale ſmaller than thoſe in Horſes, and are no wayes uſeful for the knowing of their Age; there are alſo ſome People who leſs eſteem ſuch Mares as have them, and <hi>I</hi> am alſo of their Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have been accuſtomed to eat Oats or Straw when very young, that is at two years or two years and an half old, appear by the Teeth to be elder then really they are, for beſides that it maketh them ſooner to change their Foal-teeth, it alſo very much uſeth and weareth thoſe which come in their Places, by which means the mark is ſooner worn out, as I ſhall ſhow you hereafter.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe hath no more Foal-teeth, and that his Outward or Corner-teeth begin only to appear, he is then in his fifth year, that is, he hath about four years and an half, and is feeding, or as we ſay going in his fifth; for it is a common way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ones ſelf and underſtood by all, that untill the inner ſide of a Horſes Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth be as high as the outward, he is ſtill but five years old, as I ſhall afterward explain.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Corner-teeth come forth, they appear to be only of equal height with the Gums, after which they grow by degrees, and at full five they are above the Gums as I ſhall explain; now the difference between thoſe teeth and the others which are next to them, is that they are ſharp upon the out ſide and the inward part as yet full of fleſh, and then proportionably as they grow the fleſh within diſappeareth, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the place of it a hollow over all the inward part of the Teeth, which as yet are not flat in the top, that is, they are not ſo high upon the inſide as upon the out, which they will come to be, about a year after they have cut and appeared.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall repeat it again that I may be the better underſtood; ſo ſoon then as a Horſe puts forth his Corner-teeth, they are only of equal height with the Gums upon the outſide, and the inſide of them is filled with fleſh untill he be near five; ſo when a Horſe hath put forth his Corner-teeth, and that they are as yet filled with Fleſh, you may confidently affirm that he is not as yet five, becauſe at five years old, the fleſh which filled the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of theſe Teeth diſappears; from five to five and an half, the Corner-teeth remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179659:34"/>hollow in the inſide, and that part which was filled with fleſh is empty, and will continue ſo till five and a half; from five and a half untill ſix, that hollow which is upon the inſide filleth up, the Teeth grow, and become flat and equal on both ſides on the top, and there remaineth but a little cavity in the middle, both edges of the Teeth being as I ſaid of an equal height; People obſerve this Cavity or Mark in the very upper parts of theſe Teeth, which ſomewhat reſembleth the Bud or Eye of a dry Bean, and then they ſay a Horſe is entring ſix; for ſo long as a Horſes Corner teeth, are not ſo high upon the inſide as upon the out, he is ſtill ſaid to be but five, although he be five and a half and ſometimes ſix.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe this matter is of conſequence, you would do well to remember, that at two years and a half the Gatherers are put forth, at three years and a half the middle Teeth or Separaters, and at four years and a half the Corner teeth, which are filled upon the inſide with fleſh, and upon the out ſide are only about the thickneſs of a Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece above the Gums, and ſo they continue till five; from five to five and a half, the fleſh diſappears and the Teeth remain hollow, that is, the inner edge is not ſo high as the outward, which at that time will be about the thickneſs of two Crown-pieces above the Gums; from five years and a half to ſix, that hollow diminiſheth, and the Teeth at ſix are level and equal upon the top, that is, have there inſides as high as their outward, and there remaineth only a little hollow or black ſpeck in the middle, which as I ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth the Bud or Eye of a dry Bean, and then the Teeth are above the Gums about the breadth of ones little finger; thus have you the age of a Horſe very diſtinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained until he be ſix years old, and perhaps a little too tediouſly.</p>
                     <p>After a Horſe hath come to this age, people look only to the Corner-teeth, the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters, and Tuſhes, to know if he have Mark; becauſe the firſt Teeth which grow up, after a Horſe caſteth his Foale-teeth, are the Gatherers, and as they are firſt put forth, ſo the mark doth firſt wear out of them; after them do the Separaters grow up, and they alſo by degrees loſs their mark; and laſt of all are the Corner-teeth put forth, and it is only upon them which people look, to know if a Horſe as yet marketh, for in the reſt there is but very little to look to, unleſs that the Horſe were naturally hollow or ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooth'd, which I ſhall explain hereafter.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe is ſaid to have mark, when his Corner-teeth are a little hollow and black in the middle; yet to be black is not enough, for they muſt alſo have a little hollow in the middle, about the breadth of the thickneſs of a Farthing, and the black ſpeck muſt be in the bottom of it.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe of ſix years old marketh after the manner I have ſhewn you, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Corner-teeth are above the Gums about the thickneſs of ones little finger, in ſome a little more but not much.</p>
                     <p>I ſay at full ſix, a Horſe will have his Corner-teeth the breadth of ones little finger above his Gums, and the black and hollow part of his Teeeth will be diminiſhed, but then his Tuſhes will be at their full length; at ſeven years old his Corner-teeth will be yet longer, as about the thickneſs of the ſecond, or Ring-finger, and the hollow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite worn out and gone.</p>
                     <p>At eight years old the Horſe will have Razed, that is, none of his Teeth will have any hollow in them, but be flat quite over which we call Razed, and then they will have of height about the thickneſs of the middle-finger above the Gums; you muſt then after that a Horſe hath put forth his Corner-teeth, conſider well the height they have above his Gums, beſides the little black Cavity that ſhould be alwayes in the middle of them, that ſo you may the better judge of his age, and you ſhall make your Obſervation after this manner following.</p>
                     <p>From four years old and a half untill five, the Corner-teeth will be above the Gums about the thickneſs of a Crown-peice, from five to five and a half, about the thickneſs of two Crown-pieces, and at ſix years old the breadth of ones Little-finger, at ſeven years the breadth of ones Ring-finger, and at eight the thickneſs of ones Middle-finger; thoſe different heights are thus diſtinguiſhed, to be in place of a local memory to thoſe who intend to be inſtructed; when I ſay height or thickneſs, I mean the length of the Teeth, and when I mention Fingers, I underſtand thoſe of a mans hand who is of an ordinary ſtature.</p>
                     <p>Now perhaps ſome pretender or half skilful perſon will ſay, that there is here a great many Repetitions of one and the ſame thing, and that it had been enough to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned each particular but once; that to know the age is no ſuch difficult matter, as that it ſhould be needful ſo frequently to repeat the particulars of it: But I muſt anſwer this Doctor or Teacher, that it is not for him I have writ, and that whoever readeth this with a deſign to profite by it, will be ſo far from finding fault with Repetitions, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179659:35"/>upon the contrary they will be rather a ſatisfaction to him, and that whereby he will be the better inſtructed and cleared.</p>
                     <p>It is a common received opinion amongſt moſt people, that Horſes Raze, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely loſe their mark at eight years old, but I have ſeen a great many which had not Razed even at nine, who according to that ordinary obſervation, would have paſled but for Horſes of ſeven, but that is of ſmall conſequence providing they be thought young; for the age or youth of Horſes conſiſts much in fancy, although in France their being young maketh a part of their value and price, and yet when they are above eight they are in their full ſtrength and beauty, and fit for any ſervice, but ſeldom before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that age, eſpecially the Horſes of <hi>Breſs, Auvergne,</hi> and <hi>Limoſin,</hi> ſo that it is at that age in which Horſes begin to be ſerviceable and good, (providing they have not been over-rid and ſpoilt in their youth,) that the French reject and will have none of them.</p>
                     <p>As to Horſes deſigned for the Manage or Wars, they do not ſo much conſider their age as to make it augment or diminiſh their prices, becauſe it requireth a good dale of time to render a Horſe adroit, ſupple, and eaſy, eſpecially if they do not reſolve to ſpoill him in dreſſing, but to preſerve his Gentleneſs; for it is rare to find Horſes of ſix years old brought ſuch a length, and ſo confirmed in their Leſſons, as to be fit to give ſatisfaction in the Manage, or be ſerviceable in the Wars: Therefore although Horſes have eight, nine, yea ten years of age, yet if they have all the qualities of good and ready Horſes, people do not ſtand or ſcruple at their having no mark, but pay very dear for them, without making their value any wayes conſiſt in their being only ſix years old, as is done in Runners and other Horſes.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, according to the Calculation of the French, who eſteem none but thoſe of ſix, a Horſe will be only good for the ſpace of one or two years, conſider then if it be not ridiculous, to ſubmit to an opinion ſupported by ſo bad a foundation as that is, of only eſteeming a Horſe for the ſpace of one or two years; at that rate, good-buy to all the Horſes of <hi>Breſs, Auvergne, Limoſin,</hi> and others which are not at their very beſt till full eight, for ſhould we only eſteem theſe Horſes at ſix years old, we ſhould never find a good one, and can people be guilty of a greater folly, than never to deſire Horſes but when they are worth nothing, and to put them off when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to prove good and ſerviceable.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore a very great overſight ſo to tye up ones ſelf, as never to buy any but young Horſes for preſent ſervice, for beſides that their being young adds to their price, and although that they may be ſo ſhaped, as one may juſtly expect they will be long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable without being ſpoilt, yet we ſee many of them whoſe Legs are quite ruined and gone with one years fatigue, whoſe Hams become ſo weak that they can endure no Travel, and who at laſt grow even Blind although they have had very good eyes when firſt bought; ſo that a man when he cometh to part with them, either abſolutely looſeth them, or at leaſt a conſiderable part of the price they ſtood him; but when a man buyeth Horſes of nine or ten years of age that are not ſpoilt, and which have good Limbs, with their Flanks and other parts proportionable, then he is certain ſeing thoſe parts have been ſo long right preſerved, that they are ſound and will laſt a long time, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their full goodneſs and vigour; and that which I like beſt in ſuch Horſes, is that they are bought at a third, nay half the rate of young Horſes, and alſo oft-times laſt longer, ſo that the hazard is not ſo great as in buying of young Horſes, from whom you ſuffer all the inconveniences and bad ſervice, to which their younger years are ſubject, beſides your being very uncertain how they will at laſt prove and ſucceed: However ſeing it is in this ſnare and miſtake that all ſuch perſons who have but little skill do eaſily fall, I am ſatisfied that they buy firſt young Horſes, and at a great rate, that they keep them but a year, and then loſs half if not their whole price, becauſe they like this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod beſt their fancy leading them to it; for after what I have ſaid, I leave every man to follow his own humour and fancy.</p>
                     <p>I muſt likewayes tell you that it is quite contrary in Horſes as it is with men; young people labour, and endure fatigue incomparably better than old, Horſes again, toil better when they are old than young: Men when young, eat and ſleep better than when they are aged, but Horſes upon the contrary eat a great dale more when a little aged, and alſo reſt better; finally people may lay their account with this, that the greateſt fatigues of War are always performed by Horſes of a middle age, and that but few die of old age in a Campaigne but moſtly by accidents which might alſo have befallen thoſe that are young.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:179659:35"/>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved that the Teeth wear, and are uſed upon the upper parts where the mark is, which is as I have ſaid that black Cavity in the middle of them; becauſe it is that part of the Teeth, which is moſt made uſe of, for with it the Horſe cuts his Graſs, and draws his provender or Hay and Straw from the Rack, yet notwithſtanding of that, they do not forbear to grow inſenſibly, and as the Gums through time become lean, ſo they make the Teeth to appear long, and it is certain that ſo much the longer a Horſes Teeth are, he is ſtill ſo much the elder, they alſo about that age contract a great dale of Naſtineſs and Ruſt upon them, and become yellow; there are however ſome old Horſes which have very white and ſhort Teeth, people ſay of ſuch that they have a good Mouth conſidering their Age; it is alſo worth noticing, that ſome Horſes will have a black ſpeck in their Teeth reſembling the true Mark, a long time after they are paſt Eight or Nine, but then it is not hollow, therefore People ſhould not lay any ſtreſs upon it, although the Horſe Courſers may warrant it for a true Mark, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have not counterfeited it, but that it is altogether natural; however al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be not artificial, yet I ſay People ſhould lay no hold upon it, for although old Horſes have ſometimes that black ſpeck without any Cavity, and alſo that it be natural, yet it does no wayes relate to their Age, and they are ne're a whit the younger for it.</p>

How to know a Horſes age, which is either paſt Mark, Shel Tooth'd, or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.</note> how a Horſes Age is to be known by the Teeth which mark, I muſt now conſider ſome other obſervations, which I ſhall explain as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as poſſible, and if I have been a little too prolixe upon this matter, perhaps it will not be the worſe for the Reader.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as a Horſe hath Razed, which the Italians call <hi>Cavallo Serrado,</hi> a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of his age but by the length of his fore-teeth, or Tuſhes; and firſt by the Tuſhes which are in his upper Jaw, which are almoſt oppoſite to thoſe below, you muſt feel them with your Finger, and if they be quite worne and equal with the palat, the Horſe is then at leaſt Ten years old, however this obſervation is not ſo certain, but that it ſometimes faileth, eſpecially if the Horſe when young, hath carried a bigger mouth'd bit than was proper for him, which with a little time may have uſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd his Tuſhes; yet I have found it fail but very ſeldom.</p>
                     <p>People alſo draw a very good obſervation from the under Tuſhes, for young Horſes have them always ſharp and poynted, pretty long, ſome what edged upon both ſides, and without any kind of Ruſt, Scales, or Naſtineſs upon them; but as they become aged their Tuſhes grow very big and Blunt, become round and ſcalie, and in very old Horſes they grow extremely thick and round, and at laſt appear altogether uſed and yellow.</p>
                     <p>The upper Tuſhes do alſo diſcover a Horſes youth, for if a Horſe be but ſix, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tuſhes will be a little channel'd, or ſome-what hollow'd and grooved upon the inſides, and when he is above ſix, they fill up and become as it were a little round in the inſides, this Obſervation is ſo good, that it never or but very rarely faileth.</p>
                     <p>A man ſhould therefore make it his buſineſs, to underſtand the Tuſhes, for they are abſolutely the moſt certain marks whereby to know a Horſes age, and by them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179659:36"/>with the aſſiſtance of the Corner-teeth, a man will hardly fail to judge pretty near of a Horſes Age.</p>
                     <p>The Fore-teeth and Tuſhes are the ſureſt Marks whereby a Horſes Age is known, yet a man may know if a Horſe be very old, by lifting up his Upper-lip, for if the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-teeth be exceſſive long, it is a token of very great Age; it may be alſo obſerved at the ſame time if they be uſed and worn in the middle, which if they are, will be a ſign that the Horſe is ſubject to the <hi>Tack,</hi> which is an imperfection, that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly diſcovered without ſeing him eat, ſee Chap. 25. of this part, yet if a man perceive a Horſes Gatherers to be uſed, and the other Teeth upon each ſide of them ſomewhat longer then they, then he may aſſuredly conclude that he is a <hi>Ticker</hi> and very old.</p>
                     <p>All other Marks are for the moſt part uncertain, as to have recourſe to the Joints of the Tail, to the folds of the Under-lip, and other different obſervations in which I never found any great certainty; as for example, there cometh forth a knot or joynt in the upper part of a Horſes Rump when he is between Ten and Twelve, a ſecond when he is Fourteen; people perceive theſe knots or joynts by paſſing their hand alongſt the Horſes Rump, from the very onſet of it, or that part where the Crupper of the Saddle reſteth, to the lower end of it; thoſe who are ſatisfied with this mark may make uſe of it, for my part I eſteem it very little.</p>
                     <p>As for that knowledge which is acquired by the Under-lip, I ſaw once a Gentle-man hit luckily enough upon the age by it; he did it thus, he conſidered how many plyes or folds the Horſe had in his Under-lip when he thruſt it back, and as many folds as he obſerved in the Lip, ſo many years old he ſaid the Horſe had, he who will ſtudy, and give faith to ſuch a kind of knowledge as this, ſhall have full liberty to do it.</p>
                     <p>For my own particular, I have alwayes recourſe to a Horſes Legs after his mark is gone, to know if they be neat and good, to his flank if it be well truſſed and not too full and ſwallowed up, but freſh and without any alteration; alſo to his feet, to ſee if they are not ſpoilt, and if he walk after the manner which I ſhall hereafter explain, and laſt of all to his Appetite; Theſe are the Tokens and Symptoms of Youth which I tye my ſelf to; but as in <hi>Horſe-craft</hi> more than in any other affair, every man hath his own humour and thoughts, I ſhall here diſcourſe of the moſt certain obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a man can make uſe of, whereby to know the Age of a Horſe that is paſt mark.</p>
                     <p>When the Pits above the Eyes are extremely hollow, it is almoſt always a certain Tok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of old Age, although Horſes which are of an old Stallions get, have alſo thoſe Pits very deep even at four or five years old, as alſo their Ey-lids and Eyes, wrinkled and hollow.</p>
                     <p>When that part of the nether-Jaw-bone, which is about three or four finger breadth above the Beard, and ſo upwards, is ſharp and thin, that is, if in paſſing the hand alongſt it, it feel edged, it is a certain ſign of Age, but upon the contrary, if it be round it is a token of Youth; it is certain that in young Horſes, that part of the Nether-jaw-bone is alwayes round, but in old Horſes ſharp and edged, ſo that a man who is a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, will before ever he open a Horſes Mouth judge pretty near of his Age, by only feeling this part of the Nether-jaw-bone; this is a very good Remark.</p>
                     <p>People alſo with their two fingers and Thumb, pull the Skin of the Neither-jaw-bone or Shoulder, a little to them, and if the Skin continue a long time without returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to it's place, it is a ſign ſay they that the Horſe is not young, and that the longer it is of returning the older he is; a man ſhould not much truſt to this obſervation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Skin of a Lean Horſe although young, will be longer of returning to it's place, than the Skin of an old Horſe that is fat and plump; but this obſervation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very good; the points of the Gatherers in the Nether-jaw, when a Horſe groweth old ſtand outwards a little, and when he is extremely old point almoſt ſtraight forewards, but when he is young they ſtand almoſt ſtraight up, and form as it were a hollow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Tongue, ſo that they are juſt equal with the outter edges of theſe above; it ſometimes falleth out that they are the upper-teeth which thus extend themſelves forewards, but for the moſt part it is the under that do it, and when a Horſe hath his Under-teeth thus ſituate, he is ſaid to be <hi>Sprung in the Beak,</hi> and it is a very good obſervation whereby to know Horſes which are extremely old.</p>
                     <p>Another certain Mark of old Age, is when a horſe <hi>Seeleth,</hi> that is, when upon his Eye-brows there groweth about the breadth of a farthing of white hairs, mixed with thoſe of his natural colour; a horſe never <hi>Seeleth</hi> untill he be fourteen years old, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before he be fifteen or ſixteen at fartheſt; The light or lyard ſorel and black, do ſooner <hi>Seel</hi> then any other colours; but this may be relyed upon, that a Horſe never <hi>Seeleth,</hi> or becometh lyard above the eyes, untill he be fourteen or fifteen years old.</p>

                     <p>But becauſe it is eaſy for a man, although he have but very little skill, to perceive when a Horſe ſeeleth or is lyard above the Eyes, the Horſe Courſers do therefore pull out all thoſe white Hairs with pincers, being rather ſatisfied that there Horſes ſhould appear bald then ſeeled; and when their Horſes have ſuch a number of white hairs, that they cannot conveniently pull them all out without making them look ugly, they then collour over or bedaub all their Eye-browes, that ſo that imperfection of old age may not appear.</p>
                     <p>A Man may alſo judge of a Horſes Age, by looking to his Palate, becauſe proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as a Horſe groweth old, the roof of his Mouth becometh Leaner, and dryer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle, and thoſe Ridges which in the Palats of young Horſes are pretty high and plump, do by degrees diminiſh as they increaſe in Age; as for example, at ſix years old the Palate is more fleſhy, and thoſe Ridges higher than at eight, and at Ten, Twelve, or Thirteen, they will be ſtill proportionably more low and lean than they were at eight or nine, ſo that at laſt the roof of the Mouth, in very old Horſes, hath nothing elſe upon it but skin and bone, this remark is extreamly good, eſpecially in Mares, who have very ſeldom any Tuſhes whereby one may know their age</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> people are more certain of the Age of Horſes, for all thoſe who have good breeds, and amongſt them young Horſes which they expect will one day prove good, go to a publick Nottar, and their in preſence of Witneſſes, receive an atteſtation of the Age of their young Horſes or Colts, at ſuch a time as it can be certainly known, which is ſo long as they have their Foal teeth, ſo that the Nottars declare that ſuch a horſe, of ſuch a colour, and ſuch a Mark, ſuch a ſhape, and ſuch a Breed or Race, and marked after ſuch a faſhion, was at ſuch a time ſo many years old, and this he ſigneth together with the Witneſſes, and delivereth it to the owner of the horſe, who when he hatha deſign to ſell him, produceth his Teſtificat to prove the horſes age; if people obſerved this method in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> there would not be ſo many horſes Counter-marked, and the Tricks and ſubtilties which are frequently performed by horſe Courſers, in the <hi>Place-Moubert</hi> and <hi>Smith-field,</hi> would be of no uſe.</p>
                     <p>Gray horſes become White proportionably as they grow old, and when they are very aged they are White all over, but this doth not conclude that there are no horſes foaled White; although but very rarely: But people know thoſe which have been Foaled Gray, by remarking their extremities, as Knees and Hams, which continue for the moſt part ſtill of that colour.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome horſes whoſe Teeth continue alwayes beautiful and White, and as ſhort as if they were but ſix, although they have oft-times more then Twelve Years, if ſuch Horſes fall into the hands of any Rogues or Cheats, they never faill to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark them, and ſell or put them off as if they had but only ſix.</p>
                     <p>To prevent therefore being impoſed upon after this manner, and alſo to underſtand when a horſe is Counter-marked, you muſt know firſt, that a horſe is ſaid to be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-marked, or to have the mark in his Teeth counterfeit, when his Corner-teeth are made hollow with an ingraving Iron, and made black within, to imitate as much as poſſible the true and natural Mark; they make the cavity or hollow black immediatly after it is made, by putting a little double-ink into it, and there letting it dry, which will remain ſo long as the Teeth continue hollow; thoſe who are more cunning and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, with a red hot Iron burn a grain of Rye in the hollows of the Teeth, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them perfectly black, for there proceedeth from the Rye a kind of Oyl, which by the help of the burning cleaveth extremely cloſs and faſt, to the hollows of the Teeth which are newly cut: There are other methods of Counterfeitting a horſes Mark, but as it is below a man of honour to practiſe any of them, ſo is it enough that I have ſaid as much of them, as may prevent your being deceived, when you ſhall meet with any which are ſo.</p>
                     <p>You will know when a horſe is Counter-marked, by looking to the hollows of his Teeth, which will never ſo very exactly reſemble the natural Mark, but with a little practice the Cheat may be diſcovered; beſides the graver maketh ſometimes little ſlips which ſcratch the other parts of the Teeth, becauſe the Horſe doth ſometimes ſtir and move, and is not ſo very quiet as he ought: the Teeth are alſo hard which maketh the Operator's hand nuſtedy, and ſo is the occaſion of thoſe irregular ſcratches; when a man perceives ſuch ſcratches upon the outſides of the hollows of the Teeth, then is the Horſe Counter-marked: Moreover the upper Tuſhes ſhould be conſidered, which ſhould be groov'd, that is, that upon the inſides of them from the very Palate to their points they ſhould be hollow, and that untill the Horſe be ſeven years old; beſides when a Horſe is old the upper Teeth will be too long, over paſſing theſe below, and yellow, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179659:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>low part of the neither Jaw-bone ſharp and edged, the under Tuſhes uſed, big and ſcaly, Whereas if he had but ſix, The under Tuſhes would be ſmall, pointed, and pretty ſharp upon both the edges.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe which appears marked, have alſo many other ſigns and Tokens of old age, it is very probable that he is Countermarked, you will alſo know if he be ſo, becauſe the falſe Mark is never ſo exactly Counterfeit, but with a little experience you will come to know it's very ſhape, Beſides that the Teeth will be oft-times longer than they ſhould, and the artificial hollow a great dale blacker than the natural; it requireth indeed a little practice to diſcover exactly when a horſe is Counter-marked, and alſo a man muſt have obſerved well, how a Horſe is Marked with the true and natural Mark, and how he hath his Teeth placed and framed, after which he will very rarely be miſtaken or deceived by the falſe one.</p>
                     <p>To believe that people file or ſaw a Horſes Teeth to make them ſhort, is what I could never as yet ſee ſucceed, although I have uſed all Diligence imaginable, to inform my ſelf if it was practicable; It is true ſome do it to Men, but I never knew any who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully tryed it upon Horſes; for it is certain that people never Counter-mark any Horſes, but ſuch whoſe Teeth appear beautiful and young, that is ſhort and white, and all thoſe who have attempted to ſaw a Horſes Teeth thereby to ſhorten them, meet but with a great dale of trouble and vexation, neither do I believe that ever any man made twice tryal of it in his Lifetime; for if people ſhould only file or ſaw the under teeth, which are thoſe at which people look to know the age, then thoſe above will be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be longer than thoſe which have been ſhortned, and if the teeth both above and below be ſhortned, it will ſo fall out, that the jaw-teeth or Grinders being at their full length, will join, and ſo hinder the upper and lower Teeth which were ſhortned, to cloſe upon other, which will manifeſtly diſcover the Cheat; for the Horſes mouth being ſhut, the Fore-teeth will be at as great a diſtance from other, as that length is which was taken from them; Beſides, thoſe horſes upon whom this operation is performed, are a long time without being in a condition, to chaw their meat with any tollerable eaſe, becauſe of the ſtreſs they have received by the filing, neither can they draw their hay or ſtraw from the Rack, becauſe of the diſtance which is between their lower and upper teeth.</p>
                     <p>Horſes whoſe Teeth have been ſhortned are eaſily known, not only by what I have ſaid, but alſo by their Tuſhes, which will not be ſo faſhion'd and ſhap't, as I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered they ſhould be in young Horſes; therefore I adviſe no to man try it, not only becauſe it will prove prejudicial to the Horſe, but alſo becauſe ſuch kind of Tricks or whatever you call them, are in truth below a man of any Ingenuity or Candour.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which have their Teeth very long, and yet have a black ſpeck in the middle of them; ſuch Horſes are ſaid to be Shell-tooth'd, in french <hi>Beguts,</hi> and they have that mark all their Life, at leaſt a great part of it; Geldings are more ſubject to this of being Shell-tooth'd then Ston'd Horſes, but Mares more than either; Moſt part of the <hi>Hungarian, Polonian, Cravat,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Horſes which I have ſeen, were thus Shell-tooth'd.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſily known when a Horſe is ſo, becauſe he appeareth to mark in all the other Fore-Teeth as well as in the Corner, that is, both in the Separaters and Gatherers, and therefore to know his age, the ſame methods muſt be taken as to know the age of a Horſe which is Counter-marked, ſuch as the length of his Teeth, uſed Tuſhes, ſharp and edged nether Jaw-bones, and ſeveral other which I have before ſet down.</p>
                     <p>Horſes put forth their Gatherers, when about thirty Months old, thereafter the Marks which were in them begin to wear; when the Separaters come forth, the Marks which were in the Gatherers are half worn out, and then at ſix years old they quite diſappear, ſo afterwards a Horſe hath no more mark in them; thoſe again next to them call'd the Separaters, have about that time, or when the horſe is ſix, the Marks which are in them half worn out, but in horſes which are Shell-tooth'd the Mark never almoſt weareth out or diſappeareth, but remaineth in them as it alſo doth in the Gatherers and Corners, which is the Reaſon that people, when they perceive a horſe to have Mark in the Gatherers as well as in the other Fore-teeth, do conclude that he is Shell-tooth'd and with ſo much the more certainty, if he have alſo with it very long Teeth, and of a greater growth than they ſhould be at ſix, with other obſervations which I have already given you.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that Shell-tooth'd horſes, have been once in their Lifetime only five or fix year old, and that at the ſaid age of five or ſix they have had their Mark true and good, although it appeared equally in all their Fore-teeth at one and the ſame time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that caſe it would be a great overſight, to conclude them old, becauſe they are Shell-tooth'd, eſpecially when other Tokens of youthare diſcovered in them, ſuch as ſhort
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179659:37"/>Teeth, ſmall and ſharp Tuſhes, &amp;c. for it is to thoſe that a man muſt chiefly take notice, before he pronounce his Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth this conclude but that there are ſome Shell-tooth'd horſes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have Mark all their Life-time, yet have it not in all their Teeth, but in ſuch horſes the age is alſo known by the length of the Teeth, Tuſhes, and other ſigns of old age which I have already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I am apt to believe, that if a man apply himſelf to conſider all I have ſaid, concerning the knowledge of a Horſes age, and that he alſo put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by taking care to look at a great many Horſes Mouths, and obſerve the differences amongſt them; I ſay without doubt he ſhall never be deceived, but above all he muſt make it his buſineſs, to know when the legs are good, the feet ſound, the flank right, for if he think that this knowledge can be acquired by the ſimple reading over of this Book, it is what will deceive him, becauſe it is only cuſtome and experience that can confirme him in it.</p>
                     <p>Several perſons have thought it ſtrange, that after the reading of this Book over and over, they did not find themſelves Skilful, eſpecially as to the knowledge of a Horſes Age, ſo that if they had not frequently heard the Book commended, they acknowledged they would have condemned it, for not being diſtinct enough in its directions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſucceeded ſo ill with them; I do therefore with a great dale of ingenuity and ſincerity declare to ſuch Gentlemen, that the knowledge of Horſes is not acquired by ſimple reading; one it's true muſt underſtand the theorie, but he muſt put in practice what he hath Read, go viſit Horſes, examine all the different Circumſtances, and earneſtly apply himſelf to it untill he firſt underſtand it, and then be Maſter of it; the moſt common Sciences are not acquired by one ſingle reading, they muſt be ſtudied and carefully conſidered; and far more this I am Treating of which is more Practical than Speculative, for if you do not practiſe, and by your own Judgement joyn the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative part to the Practical, you will but in vaine make uſe of this Book, and I ſay not only this Book, but the very beſt that can poſſibly be compiled on this Subject; if therefore thoſe Gentlemen, do not become knowing and Skilful by meer reading with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out practice, let them only blame themſelves, ſeing if they be interrogat upon any of the defects or diſeaſes which are ſpecified in the Book, they can give no reaſonable account of any of them; for firſt of all the ſenſe and meaning muſt be well underſtood, and then fixed in the memory and made ſo very familiar, that ſo ſoone as any Diſeaſe or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is named, a Man may be able to give immediatly the defenition of it, and tell in what part of the Body it cometh, and afterwards put what relateth to it in practice; ſo here are three things required in a Man to be Skilfull, to comperhend or underſtand, to learn or to have the cheif things relating to the Diſeaſe fixt in his memory, and to practiſe; for without this practice, a common Stable boy will let you know, that he is more Skilfull than you.</p>
                     <p>Having explained every thing which relateth to the age, we moſt now conſider the other faults and Imperfections to which Horſes are Subject, I Suppoſe a Man hath made himſelf as much Maſter of the knowledge of a Horſes age as poſſible; let him therefore ſhut his mouth, and look after his other Imperfections, holding this always for an infallible Maxim, that when once you find a fault, you muſt apply your ſelf with all poſſible Attention to diſcover it to the very bottom, and having ſo diſcovered it, think no more on't, but go to another, and proceed thus orderly from one Imperfection to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; I give not theſe directions to ſuch perſons as are Skilful, and who in the twinkling of an eye can diſcover every fault, and who ſo ſoon as they look to a Horſe, if there be any thing wrong about him, it is the very firſt thing that cometh in their View, ſo that it would ſeem their eyes could look to nothing elſe but that fault; but it is not thus with theſe Novices for whom I write, for they muſt have more time to examine one Horſe, and go over him from head to foot, than a knowing perſon will take to conſider four, for it is enough for him only to look to a Horſe, and walk gently about him, and in that ſhort time he will preceive all that can be ſeen.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter having known a Horſes age,<note place="margin">CHAP VII How to know if a Horſes Eyes be good.</note> you muſt conſider his Eyes, the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which is difficult enough, and requireth a very long and aſſiduous practice without being diſcouraged; at firſt when one looketh to the Eyes, the good and bad appear alike, but if yow perſiſt to look to and conſider them attentively, you will diſcover the third time what you did not perceive the firſt, and the twentieth time, what you have not as yet been Senſible of, and finally by the cuſtome and practice of looking to them, a Mans Eyes as one would think are opened, ſo that he perceives and ſees diſtinctly, what at the beginning appeared to him Darkneſs and obſcurity; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for do not diſquiet your ſelf, but perſiſt continually to look to them, and I aſſure you you ſhall ſucceed: That Eyes may be exactly well perceived, the Horſe muſt be right Situate; the Eyes are perceived with a great dale of more eaſe, when a Horſe is taken from a Dark place to another which is very light, for example, in coming out of the Stable, and juſt as his head is without the door, you may then look to his Eyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, not by looking as it were ſtreight upon them, but a little a ſquint, for looking thus ſlopwayes to them, you will perceive them to the very ground or bottom.</p>
                     <p>But if you be in the open feilds upon a march, or in a publick Mercate place or Fair, it is very difficult to perceive Eyes in the Sunſhine, therefore you muſt alwayes take the Horſe to a ſhade, and alſo that you may the better diſcern them, place your hand above his Eye to keep away the too great light, for in the Sun all Eyes appear to be better than really they are.</p>
                     <p>Any Man who hath an inclination to know, and judge truely of a Horſe's Eyes, let him firſt conſider them at night in the Stable, by the light of a very ſmall wax Candle or <hi>Bugie,</hi> and there he will perceive the ground of the Eye to the very leaſt taſh, but then the Horſes Eye muſt be placed between you and the <hi>Bugie</hi> or candle, and when once you come to know and underſtand them well by the <hi>Bugie,</hi> you will diſcern and diſtinguiſh them with the more eaſe in the day time; yet although a Man may fancy, that he perceives and knowes the Eyes very well with a candle or <hi>Bugie,</hi> I would not adventure to buy a Horſe upon that obſervation, becauſe I might be deceived by it, therefore I do not ſhew you this Method, as one by which you may certainly know the Eyes of a Horſe, but only as a help for your more eaſily coming to underſtand them.</p>
                     <p>A Man may quickly know to place a Horſe right, that ſo he may obſerve his eyes, if he but reflect, that when he is upon his back and ſtooping a little forewards with his Body, he will perceive them very well, but he will yet perceive them better, being on foot and ſtanding before him.</p>
                     <p>Having placed the Horſe right that ſo you may conveniently perceive his Eyes, we ſhall next conſider it's parts, <hi>Qui bene diſtinguit hene docet,</hi> and to evite confuſion, I ſay there are two parts to be chiefly conſidered in the Eyes, to wit the Criſtal and the bottom or ground of the Eye; The Criſtal is that roundneſs of the Eye which appeareth at firſt view, being the moſt tranſparent part of it, and ſhould for clearneſs reſemble a peice of Rock-Criſtal, ſo that one may ſee clearly thorough it, neither ſhould it be covered with any cloud, obſcurity, ſpot, or Whiteneſs, becauſe if the Criſtal appear obſcure and troubled, ſo that you cannot ſee through it, it is a ſign that the Eye is not good; the Eye ſhould have alſo no white Circle about it, yet there are Horſes who have this Cricle and have alſo very good Eyes, but however it were rather to be wiſhed that they wanted it; now upon the exact conſideration of the Criſtal does the knowledge of the Eyes depend, you are therefore to uſe your utmoſt endeavours to know certainly if it be exactly tranſparent, and although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at firſt view you cannot come to know it, yet you are not to be concern'd at it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179659:38"/>but ſtill to continue looking untill you have acquired the perfect knowledge of it, for by degrees your eyes will be opened, and you will perceive it diſtinctly; that which is the cauſe why many people arrive not at the true knowledge of the Eyes, is becauſe they are at the very firſt diſcouraged, and ſay, I can perceive nothing in ſuch and ſuch Eyes, for the good and bad appear to me alike; but I muſt tell you, that although you ſhould be ten or fifteen dayes without making any diſtinction, and that they ſhould all appear alike to you, yet do not give it over, but continue to conſider them with care and attention, and at laſt you will gain your point.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe may have upon his Eye, that is upon the Criſtal of it, a whiteneſs which may have proceeded from, and be the remainder of ſome ſtroke, and which yet will not make him blind, but there is required ſome experience to diſcern it, yet not ſo much neither to diſcover it, for it is very eaſily perceived, as to know exactly if that white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will prove prejudicial or not to his ſight; to Novices every thing cauſeth fear, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſmall evil appeareth to them a conſiderable fault, when a greater imperfection is paſſed over without taking notice to it; ſuch Novices in reſpect to their knowledge in Horſes, are called but Half-skill'd, who being too nice and critical in their obſervations of Horſes, render themſelves incapable of buying any at all, for they would have the whole ſhapes of a Horſe at fifty Crowns, to be as exact and perfect as if he were worth fifty Piſtols, without ever reflecting that there are Merchandizes at all rates, and that without an eſſential fault, they ſhould not reſtrict themſelves to ſuch particularities, eſpecially in Horſes of a ſmall value.</p>
                     <p>A reddiſh Criſtal is a bad Symptom, being a ſign that the Eye is either inflamed, or that it is influenced by the Moon.</p>
                     <p>A Criſtal that is <hi>Feuille-mort,</hi> or of the colour of a dead leaf upon the lower part, and troubled upon the upper, is an infallible mark that the Horſe is Lunatick, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth no longer but while the humour doth actually poſſeſs the Eye, for the defluxion being once over, the <hi>Feuille-mort</hi> colour doth alſo immediatly diſappear; Therefore in horſes which are Lunatick, it is in vain to look for this mark when the Humour and Defluxion is not upon the Eye, now you ſhall know when the Defluxion is upon it, by the Eye being ſwelled, and emitting a great dale of hot water or humour; this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is of ſuch conſequence, that the horſe will become blind of that Eye which was influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the Moon, and alſo of both, if the Moon do influence and govern both; this mark of the Eyes being of a <hi>Feuille-mort</hi> colour, and Reddiſh, as if the Eye were full of bloody Water, is one of the moſt certain whereby to know when a horſe is Lunatick, but obſerve it is only ſo when the Defluxion hath fallen down, and then the horſe ſeeth none with that Eye upon which the Defluxion is: But to know a Lunatick Eye when the Defluxion is not actually upon it, conſider, that if only one of the Eyes be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, then it will appear leſs than the other, the Criſtal of it will be alſo troubled, and the bottom or ground of the Eye, black and browniſh; but the Moon in the Eyes is better known by a troubled Criſtal than any other mark whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of the Eye which is to be conſidered, is the ground or bottom, which is properly the pupil or apple of the Eye, and ſhould be large and full; it muſt be clearly perceived without any difficulty, that ſo you may with the more certainty know if there be any <hi>Dragon,</hi> which is a white ſpot in the bottom of the Eye, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Horſe blind of that Eye, or at leaſt will do it in a very ſhort time; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Dragon is but very ſmall, and appeareth to be no bigger then a Grain of Millet ſeed, but it groweth to ſuch a bigneſs that it will cover the whole apple of the Eye, and alſo be irrecoverable, becauſe there can be no remedy applied to the place, or made to penetrate the ſubſtance of the Eye in which the Dragon is ſituat, you muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give credit to ſuch Farriers as vaunt to have cured them, for they are incureable, and no man after the firſt moment in which they were formed, hath ever taken any of them away.</p>
                     <p>If the whole bottom or apple of the Eye be white, or of a tranſparent greeniſh white, it is a token that it is not natural, and that bottom or apple of the Eye being a little tranſparent, is that which is called in French <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n cul de Verre</hi> or bottom of a Glaſs; the Horſe perhaps is not altogether blind with it, becauſe he as yet ſeeth a little, but I would not take him having that Imperfection, but at a very ordinary rate; Accademie Horſes which are only appointed for Gentlemen to be taught upon, called <hi>Chevaux d' E'cole,</hi> are as ſerviceable and ride as agreeable when they have this imperfection, as if they had no ſuch <hi>cul de Verre,</hi> and the advantage is that their price is ſmall, and the loſs of them but inconſiderable if any accident befall them.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:179659:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>You are alſo to take notice, that if you look to a Horſes Eyes when oppoſit to a white wall, the reflection of it will make the Apples of them appear whittiſh, and a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to green, as if they had a <hi>cul de Verre,</hi> although they be indeed good; when you perceive this, you muſt remove your Horſe to another place and look to them, and then obſerve if the Eyes have ſtill the ſame appearance, in theſe different ſituations.</p>
                     <p>Before you come to obſerve the other imperfections of the Eyes, you muſt take notice if you can perceive diſtinctly above the bottom or apple of the Eye, as it were two grains of Chimney ſoot fixed to it, for if you ſee them diſtinctly, it is not only a mark that the Criſtal is clear and tranſparent, but that you alſo begin to know and underſtand the eyes, ſo that if you continue a little to make it your buſineſs, you will in a ſhort time come to underſtand them perfectly; yet although you ſee exactly theſe grains as it were of Chimney ſoot placed above the apple of the Eye, that is not a ſufficient evidence that the Eye is good, you muſt therefore over and above perceive exactly the bottom of the eye, which muſt be altogether without any ſpot or Whiteneſs, and then the eye will be good.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who to know well an Eye, obſerve if they ſee themſelves exactly repreſented in it, as in a Looking-glaſs, and who if their Face appear diſtinctly in it, conclude that the Eye is good, theſe Gentlemen I ſay are mightily miſtaken, for that kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſervation is worth nothing, becauſe a bad and troubled Eye, will more naturally repreſent to them the ſhaddow of their Face, than a good one.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo to conſider, if an Eye which is troubled and very brown, be ſmaller and leſs than the other, for if it be, it is loſt without recovery becauſe it dryeth up, Nature being defective in that part, which maketh it to become dayly ſmaller, and theſe kind of Eyes are at firſt commonly ſpoilt and loſt, by a great Defluxion of humours, or the Moon; it is alſo a great hazard if through time, a Horſe who hath loſt one of his Eyes with this diſtemper, do not alſo loſs the other; but you muſt carefully obſerve, that an eye may appear to be really leſs than the other, by ſome accident, and yet that the Horſe will not loſs his ſight in it, neither will it be troubled or of a browniſh colour; for example, the Eye-lid may have been cut or rent by a bite or Stroke, and the body of the Eye not at all damaged, ſo that the wound of the Eye lid coming to be heal'd up, or join again, it may remain a little ſtraiter than before, which will cauſe the body of the Eye to ſeem ſmaller and leſs than the other, although it be really not ſo, but only in outward appearance, which I have known many times to fall out.</p>
                     <p>There a great many more general obſervations, which may be given for knowing eyes; for example, the walk or ſtep of a blind Horſe is alwayes uncertain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, not daring to ſet down his feet boldly when he is led in ones hand; but again if the ſame Horſe be mounted by a Vigorous Horſeman, and that alſo the Horſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be mettled, then the fear of the Spurrs will make him Ride reſolutely and freely, ſo that his blindneſs ſhall hardly be perceived.</p>
                     <p>Another Mark whereby a Horſe which is abſolutely blind may be known, is that when he hears any enter into the Stable, he will prick up his Ears and move them backwards and forewards, which is a certain ſign he hath altogether loſt his ſight; the reaſon of it is, becauſe a vigorous Horſe who hath this Infirmity miſtruſteth every thing, and is continually in alarme by the leaſt noiſe that he heareth, which is eaſily diſcovered by this motion of his Eares; a Man muſt be a hundred times leſs than half skilled, to ſtand in need of ſuch common obſervations, becauſe Eyes that have loſt the faculty of Seeing are ſo very eaſy to be known, that they are immediatly diſcovered without having great experience.</p>
                     <p>The variety and diverſity of colours, are alſo means whereby to know and judge if the Eyes be good or bad; thoſe colours which are moſt ſubject to have bad Eyes, are the very dark gray, the flea bitten, the white ſpotted, and colour of a peach bloſſom, which are all but different kinds of Gray, and alſo the Roan oft times; I had almoſt forgot to tell you that weeping Eyes, and thoſe which are ſwelled in the under parts, either the one or other, is a mark that the Horſe is troubled with a Defluxion of humours; if it be actually upon the Eye, you need but put your hand upon it, and you will find the part very hot and as it were inflamed, although the ſame kind of heat may alſo proceed from a ſtroke or bite, which give the very ſame ſymptoms as a Defluxion, but in caſe of ſuch an uncertainty, from whatever cauſe the ſwelling may proceed, I would not adviſe you to take the Horſe, unleſs the owner of him warrant, and paſs his word before Witneſſes, that his Eyes are good.</p>
                     <p>When Horſes have either the true or falſe ſtrangle, or are putting forth their Teeth, that is, when they either change their Foal-teeth, or are putting out their upper Tuſhes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179659:39"/>ſome of them have their ſight at ſuch times weak and troubled, ſo that a man would judge them blind, and ſometimes they do really become ſo, but in others again, ſo ſoon as the ſtrangle or <hi>Gourme</hi> is gone, or the Teeth grown up, the ſight recovers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh more clear; this weakneſs of ſight which proceedeth from the changing of Teeth, falleth out more frequently in time of caſting the Corner-teeth, than any of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I have often ſeen Horſes, who for having caſt their <hi>Gourme</hi> or ſtrangle imperfectly have become blind, but they were either Spaniſh Horſes, Barbs, or other Southern Country Horſes.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome people who to know if a Horſes Eyes be good or bad, paſs their hand or finger before them, and if the Horſe move his Eye-lids, or wink and ſhut them, then they eſteem them good, but if he keep them ſtill open, then they ſay he hath loſt his ſight and is blind; others again make a motion with their finger, as if they would thruſt it into the Horſes eye, and obſerve if this motion of their Finger makes him ſhut it; when ever you perceive a perſon make ſuch Grimaces as theſe, you may aſſure your ſelf he knows not what he would be at, and that he underſtands nothing of what he pretends to.</p>
                     <p>This Remark did once occaſion a reproach to me, from a perſon who told me, that not being willing to paſs his hand before a Horſes eyes (leaſt the Spectators ſhould think him unskilful) he had trocked or ſwapt for one which was almoſt blind; I told him it was not this Remark of mine which was the cauſe of it, but his little knowledge, and great vanity, to be eſteemed and paſs for what he really was not, for although he had paſſed his hand before the Horſes eyes, he would have been never a whit the leſs deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I therefore adviſed him to take better notice in time coming, and to blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not my book as the cauſe of his being impoſed upon, in ſo far as he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the knowledge of the Eyes, and yet would have made people believe that he underſtood them; I alſo caus'd read this Paragraph ſince to the perſon himſelf, who was the cauſe of my ſetting it down, he profeſſed to me that it was very pat to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſince that time hath become pretty Skilful; there are ſome people who are very indifferent whether they be really skilful or not, for providing they can by their chat and pratling, make people believe that they are ſo, they are ſatisfied; for my part I am of another ſentiment, for I would rather be really skilful, and appear ignorant, by which I will come far better to my purpoſe, than if I were eſteemed Skilful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have lately begun, and even made it their ſtudy for ſome time, to know and underſtand the eyes of a Horſe, having conſidered an eye moſt cloſly, that is, as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and exactly as they can, yet will they find out but very little, ſo difficult is the true and exact knowledge of the eyes, but above all they muſt take notice to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of theſe little eyes which are ſunk into the head and very black, and examine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly if the Criſtal be clear and tranſparent, ſo that they can ſee perfectly through it, afterwards let them conſider the bottom of the eye, but eſpecially if the pupill or apple be big and large; in all eyes the ſmall, narrow, and long pupills, run a greater risk of loſſing the ſight than any other; if ſuch little eyes have all thoſe qualities I have named, then are they good; In the ſecond Chapter I mentioned a few of the qualities required in a good eye, which I ſhall not repeat in this place, it is where I ſhew how the parts of a Horſe ſhould be framed, to be well ſhap't.</p>

                     <p>TO follow that order and method which we have begun,<note place="margin">CHAP. VIII A Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the knowledge of the faults and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in Horſes.</note> a Man ſhould after his knowing the Eyes, next apply himſelf to underſtand the jaw-bones, Shoulders, Legs, and Rake or walk of Horſes, which is an eſſential quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for that ſervice which is juſtly expected of them.</p>
                     <p>After having conſidered the Age and Eyes, you muſt put your hand between the two jaw-bones near to the Horſes Throat, to feel if there be a good enough Diſtance between them, that ſo the Horſe may with the more eaſe bring in and place his head; for that diſtance between the jaw-bones being pretty large and hollow, and tapering by degrees from the Throat to the Chin, will contribute much to the goodneſs of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>Next you are to obſerve, if there be any Swelling, hardneſs, or moving kernel, between theſe two bones, which if the Horſe be young will be a ſign that he hath not as yet caſt his Gourme or Strangle, or at leaſt that he hath caſt it but imperfectly; if he be more aged, providing thoſe kernels be no bigger than large peaſe, and although he have alſo a pretty number of them, yet they are of no conſequence, becauſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſweating will diſcuſs them in a ſhort time; however if the Horſe be paſt ſix Years old, they are a little more to be feared, although they ſhould not hinder you to buy the Horſe if he otherwiſe pleaſe you; ſuch moving kernels may proceed from either a Rheume or Cold, or from a remander of the Gourme or Strangle, which may have left theſe ſwellings in that part, by which Nature diſcharged her ſelfe of her impurities, and through which theſe bad humours did evacuat themſelves, through the negligence and careleſnes of thoſe perſons, who having the charge of ſuch Horſes, did not attempt to reſolve and diſcuſs theſe bardneſes and Swellings.</p>
                     <p>If there be a fixed kernel, painful and faſtned to the jaw-bones, it is almoſt alwayes a ſign of the Glanders, eſpecially the Horſe being paſt ſeven Yeares of age, but if he be not as yet ſix, then it may be only the Strangle, eſpecially if he have no Cough with it, for commonly a cough is only an effect of the Strangle; however if there be the leaſt appearance of the Glanders, I would not adviſe you to meddle with him, becauſe it is a Diſeaſe which is very rarely cured, whatever great ſecrets, ſo many printed Books upon this Subject do promiſe for it; A Rheume or Cold may be alſo the cauſe of a kernel fixed to the jaw-bone, after the ſame manner as thoſe which proceed from the Glanders, but then it yeelds to remedies, and is diſcuſſed by a due application, yet if it be neglected, it almoſt alwayes turneth to a Glander; the method of reſolving and diſcuſing ſuch a kernel, will be found in the ſecond part, which will almoſt alwayes ſucceed, if there be no principle of putrefaction in the lungs; or malignity in the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes that have big and fixed hardneſſes, which are faſtned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly upon the inſide of one of the jaw-bones, and are no token at all of the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Theſe are Excreſcences or figgs which are of no conſequence, and are removed firſt with the inciſion knife, and then the roots of them are eaten away with <hi>Powders,</hi> but the neateſt method of taking them away, is by tying them hard about the roots in the decreſs of the Moon, with a threed of Crimſon ſilk, and then anointing them every day with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179659:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>the juice of Purſlain; theſe kind of figgs are no wayes dangerous, neither are they any ſign at all of the Horſes having the Glanders.</p>
                     <p>Seing I am ſo far engaged in this diſcourſe of fixed kernels, I ſhall tell what I ſee once befall a Horſe, who having Razed and being paſt Nine Years old, as he was making a journey there grew upon one of his jaw-bones, a large fixed kernel; he caſt at the Noſe with it, and was judged by two Farriers in <hi>Amtens</hi> to have the Glanders, who were each of them according to their teſtificat near ſixty Years of age; And although the Horſe did not caſt at the Noſe in any great quantity, yet I ſay they declared he had the Glanders; the Horſe was left there to reſt for a little time, and in fifteen dayes he recovered almoſt of his own accord, by the aſſiſtance only of three Gliſters that were given him, without any other kind of remedie; the kernel diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he did caſt no more at the Noſe, and from that time forward he had not the leaſt Symptorn of the Glanders; no doubt the Gliſters not having ſtrength enough of themſelves, as it is evident, to cure this diſtemper, it behooved to be the ſtrength of Nature alone which did effectuat this cure, and that which made me afterwards know, that this kernel did only proceed from a Rheume or Cold, was that the diſtemper fell down upon his legs, and cauſed them to ſwell extremely.</p>
                     <p>When you perceive a Horſe to have any kind of kernels between his jaw-bones, whither fixed or looſe, you muſt with your hand ſtop the Horſes Noſtrils, to ſee if being a pretty while without breathing through them, he will force himſelf to ſnear when you let them go, which if he do, you muſt obſerve if the Noſtrils run, and if he throw out of them a matter, ſomewhat reſembling the glair or whites of eggs, which if it be but in a ſmall quantity is not to be regarded, but if it be in a great abundance and of an impoſtumous conſiſtance, then is it to be feared, eſpecially if the matter which he caſteth, be Viſcuous and cleave to the inſides of the Noſtrils, into which you are alſo to look, if the ſharpneſs of the humour hath as yet occaſioned any Ulcer, which is a certain token of it's great malignity, becauſe, beſides that it is juſtly to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it may be the Glanders, it is alſo dangerous for the infecting other Horſes; and eſpecially if the Horſe hath attained to the age of eight years, you are not to venture upon him, even although that groſs and viſcuous humour ſhould have only proceeded from a Rheume: As alſo if you perceive a fixed Kernel, which the Horſe cannot ſuffer you to handle, becauſe of the great pain he endures by it, and alſo that he caſteth only at one Noſtril; or likewayes if the Kernel ſhould not be painful yet if it be very hard; and although the Horſe ſhould not have ſix years, yet if he alſo do not Cough with it, I think in all theſe caſes you may conclude with a great dale of reaſon, that it is the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179659:41"/>if from the Withers to the lower part of the Shoulder, there be a great dale of Fleſh, if it be of a round form, if the joynt at the end of the Shoulder blade where the Tie or Breaſt plate reſteth, be very large and more advanced than ordinary, which is eaſily known by conſidering the diſtance, there is between the Withers and foreſaid joynt, now this joynt being big and advanced, maketh a man immediatly conclude that the Shoulder is misſhap't; all this which I have already ſaid, denotes and is a certain ſign of the Shoulders being large and ugly, which is an imperfection, to which the Horſes bred in France are moſt commonly ſubject, becauſe for Barbs and Spaniſh Horſes, they are not to be the leſs eſteemed although there ſhoulders be a little large, providing they have the other good qualifications required in them; alſo I have ſeldom ſeen any Barbs or Spaniſh Horſes which had large ſhoulders, but they proved alwayes very good, however as upon this obſervation, I would not buy ſuch of thoſe Countrey Horſes which had large Shoulders, neither would I upon that account reject them.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Chapter of this part, where I diſcourſed of the ſhapes and beauty of all thoſe parts which generally compoſe a Horſe, I ſpoke ſome what of the ſhoulders which is very fit to be known, and therefore to prevent repetitions ſhall recomend you to it.</p>
                     <p>In Raking or Walking a Horſe, you are to conſider if his ſhoulders be very glib or moving; becauſe if they be large, charged with Fleſh, and alſo ſlow and as it were ſtiff in their motion, he ſhall never be agreeable; if he be a Pad he will be apt to trip and ſtumble, if a Courſer or Runner he will not keep long at it, becauſe of the too great trouble he findeth in galloping, and if he be a Horſe deſign'd for the mannage, he ſhall never ſucceed in any beautiful Air, for the Actions of his Legs will be always conſtrain'd, which is a very conſiderable imperfection in a mannag'd Horſe; but if his ſhoulders be too large, and yet very glib and moving, then the defect is not ſo great, although it will be offenſive and more diſagreeable to ſuch ſpectators as are skilfull, than any thing elſe; upon the contrary if the Horſe have very ſmall ſhoulders, and that he cannot move them eaſily, becauſe of the great ſtiffneſs and unweildyneſs he hath in them, then you are to reject him, unleſs he be of a very moderate price.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe which is very much charged with ſhoulders, is fit for nothing but draught, that is, either for Coach or Cart, becauſe he will be leſs ſubject to galling and ſpoyling by the Coller and Traiſes of the Harnoiſe, then if he had nothing upon his ſhoulders but Skin and Bone, but then he will not trot ſo lightly upon Travell, and therefore will weary ſo much the ſooner.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why a Horſe which is not free and eaſy, or hath no movement in his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cannot travel ſo agreeably but wearieth immediatly how vigorous ſoever he be, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> becauſe he maketh all the motion with his Legs, which occaſions him a great dale of trouble by the frequent lifting of them, although he raiſe them but a very little, and yet ſhould he want that motion in his Legs, not having it in his ſhoulders, he would be apt to ſtrike with his feet, upon every clod or ſtone that came in his way.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſes ſhoulders be large, even although very moving and glib, and his neck at the ſame time much charged with fleſh, the extraordinary weight of thoſe two parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always ſupported by his fore legs, whether in Travel or at reſt, will cauſe them to be ſooner ruin'd and ſpoyl't, then if they were altogether diſcharged of that burden; ſuch kind of Horſes are alwayes very heavy upon the hand in traveling, and when wearie, ride ill favouredly and without any kind of grace, being ſubject to trip and ſtumble in the beginning of a Journey, and to fall or come over with the Rider towards the end.</p>
                     <p>In fine, I think it is a part not to be neglected, and that a man ſhould make it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to know when a Horſes ſhoulders are well or ill ſhap't; for what ever people may think of it, experience will teach, that upon the good ſhapes of them and the Neck, doth very much depend the Gentleneſs and Delicatneſs of a Horſe; it is not but a man may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuch ſhoulders as are ſtiff and gourded, and to ſome kind of Horſes make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glib and eaſy, by Art and methodical Leſſons, yet ſeing it is what a man doth not find done already to his hand by nature, a Horſe ſhould upon that account be the leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; I would therefore never choice a Pad with ſtiff and pegged ſhoulders, that is which have no movement, becauſe ſuch Horſes, beſides that they never ride agreeably, they are alſo very ſubject to ſtumble and fall.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes, who although they have little or no movement in their ſhoulders, yet raiſe their fore legs higher, than thoſe whoſe ſhoulders are more eaſie and glib, ſo that thoſe who are ignorant look upon this Action of the Legs, as a token of the ſhoulders being eaſie and very moveable, although it is moſt certain that this motion of the Legs can be without that of the ſhoulders; and upon the contrary, other Horſes which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179659:41"/>have glib ſhoulders will alſo raiſe and truſs up their Legs to their very Bellies, ſo that you ſee one Horſe may raiſe and ply his fore-legs extremely well, and have almoſt no movement in his ſhoulders, and another ſhall have the ſame Graceful motion of the Legs, and together with it free and eaſie ſhoulders, for the one doth not include the other: therefore there is a great dale of experience required, to know when a Horſes Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are free, degadged, and moving; as for the motion of the fore-legs it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly apparent to all People, and is one of the things in the world, that giveth a Horſe which is appointed for the mannage the greateſt grace, although oft times Horſes which have the beſt and moſt gracefull movement, have not the greateſt fund of ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes have too big and large ſhoulders, others again too ſmall and little ones, that is, whoſe Counter is ſo narrow that their fore-thighs touch almoſt one another; ſuch horſes are commonly worth very little, becauſe they have a weak forehand, ſo that upon a walk or ſtep, they croſs ſo very much their Legs, that they are apt to cut themſelves, and in Galloping carry their Legs ſo confuſedly, that they are very ſubject to fall: I would therefore like a horſe better who had too much ſhoulders, than one that had this imperfection.</p>
                     <p>A fine horſe ſhould therefore have his ſhoulders flat, little, diſcharged of fleſh, and very glib and moving; but it is convenient that ſuch as are appointed for draught or the Coach, have their ſhoulders a little large, ſo that they may both endure the draught the better, and alſo not be ſo ſubject to galling.</p>

                     <p>The fore-legs are ſubject to many infirmities and weakneſſes, which make them to be with reaſon rejected by thoſe who know them to be ſuch; they are the parts of the body which ſuffer moſt, and are alſo commonly the ſmalleſt and weakeſt, let us therefore conſider all their parts in order.</p>
                     <p>The firſt mark I ſhall give you of bad legs, that is, which are uſed and ſpoilt, is if they appear altogether ſtreight, or as they were all of one piece; a horſe is ſaid to be ſtreight upon his Members, in French <hi>Droit ſur ſes membres,</hi> when the parts whereof his legs are compoſed, go all in a ſtreight line, that is, when from the knee to the fore-part of the Coronet, the knee, shank, and paſtern, deſcend in a ſtreight or plum line, and that the paſtern joynt appears more or at leaſt as much advanced as the reſt of the Leg; ſuch legs may be very well compared to thoſe of a Goat, and when a horſe is thus ſtreight upon his members, he is ſubject to ſtumble and fall, and through time the Paſtern is thruſt quite forwards out of its place, ſo that the horſe remains Lame, and then he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in French <hi>Bouleté,</hi> which is a peculiar and diſtinct name they give to horſes, whoſe Paſtern joynt is diſlodged as it were, and thruſt forwards; but that you may the better underſtand, what this imperfection of being ſtreight upon the members is, it will be fit that I diſcover to you what horſes are moſt ſubject to it, and how you ſhall know them.</p>
                     <p>Horſes then which are ſhort legg'd or ſhort joynted, are ſubject to be <hi>Bouleted,</hi> or become ſtreight upon their members, eſpecially if in ſhoeing their heels are left too high, care therefore muſt be taken to keep the heels of ſuch Horſes very low, by frequent pairing of them; thoſe Horſes again which are long joynted, do upon the contrary ply and bend their Paſterns ſo far back and near to the ground, that they are not ſo ſubject to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179659:42"/>come ſtreight membred: that a leg may be ſaid to be right planted or ſituate, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſhould be placed about two fingers breadth more backwards than the Coronet, that is, that if you ſtretch a threed or line between the top of the knee, and the fore part of the Coronet of the hoof, the fore part of the Paſtern ſhould be diſtant from that threed, about the breadth of two fingers, more or leſs according to the ſize of the Horſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a Horſe which is ſtreight upon his Members, the fore part of his Paſtern will be equal with, or as far advanced as the threed or line.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are ſtreight upon the Members, are quite contrary to thoſe that are long joynted, that is, whoſe Paſterns are ſo long and very flexible, that the Horſe in walking toucheth the ground almoſt with them, which is a great imperfection, and more to be feared than the former; for to them there may be ſome remedy uſed, but for theſe laſt there can be none, upon the contrary it is a token of little or no ſtrength, and ſuch Horſes are no wayes fit for any kind of toil or fatigue.</p>

                     <p>There are however ſome Horſes, which although they be long joynted, yet do not bend their Paſterns in walking, but keep them in ſuch a poſture and ſituation as they ought to be, without plying; thoſe kind of Horſes may prove ſervicable, becauſe that carriage of the Paſtern is a token that they are nervous, for it is nothing but the ſtrength and vigour of the nerves which ſupport the Paſtern, and prevent it's too much bending; ſo that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this caſe the imperfection of being long joynted, will be more unpleaſant to the ſight of the owner, than prejudicial to the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have thick, ſtiff, and ſhort joynts, that is, no wayes plying or flexible are very unfit for the mannage, becauſe they have no kind of gentleneſs in their motion; for glib and flexible joynts; providing they be not too long, are one of the chief quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required in a fine and delicate Horſe of Mannage.</p>
                     <p>But if the joynts be too long and flexible, beſides that the Horſe will not be fit for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, he will be alſo very ſoon ſubject to wind-galls, in French <hi>Les molettes;</hi> there are alſo ſome Horſes, which although they are not long joynted, yet have ſo ſmall and flexible Paſtern joynts, that they will not have rid two dayes Journey when they will be paſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, becauſe of the great ſwellings in their Paſtern joynts, and then thoſe ſwelling are followed by Wind-galls.</p>
                     <p>This is then one of the obſervations that is to be made, to conſider narrowly that the Paſtern joynt be neither too ſtiff nor too ſmall, nor upon the contrary too plying and ſlexible; for the knowledge of all I have ſaid concerning a Horſe which is ſtreight upon his Members, dependeth abſolutely, upon the exact obſervation of the Paſters Joynts.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Engliſh Horſes which have a great dale of Reins or ſtrength, if they have with it their Paſtern Joynts ſome what longer, than perhaps one who underſtands Horſe exactly well would wiſh, yet if they are not too flexible, ſuch a Horſe will Gallop and run with a great dale of more eaſe for his Rider, than if he were very ſhort joynted and theſe are the only propper Horſes for Perſons of quality who are become aged, and have wherewithal to ſeek after their eaſe and agreeableneſs in a Horſe; it is true ſuch Horſes will not hold out ſo long at hunting, as if they had not that imperfection, but a Perſon of quality who hath many to change, ſhould not if he conſider his own caſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them for it; ſuch Horſes may be very well compared to Coaches with Springs, which render them infinitly more eaſy than thoſe without them.</p>
                     <p>This imperfection of bending too much the Paſtern joynt, ſhould be as carefully taken notice to in the hind legs as in the fore, and there are alſo ſome Horſes which bend too much only in the hind Paſterns, and not in thoſe before, which is a token that they have a very weak hind quarter, and is a great imperfection, whatever kind of ſervice they may be deſigned for; and if they have wind-galls, they will prove more dangerous being in the hind Paſtern joynts or Legs, than if they were in thoſe before, becauſe with a little travel and fatigue, they will penetrate beneath the nerves, and ſo become thoſe which are called in French <hi>Molettes nerveuſes;</hi> alſo if ſuch Horſes are deſigned for the Coach, they will not endure pulling back, or ſtaying the Coach upon any deſcent, and therefore will not at all be propper for that uſe.</p>
                     <p>The third imperfection of the Legs is, when they are Arched, in French <hi>Jambes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179659:42"/>Arquées,</hi> which is when the Horſe being in his Natural ſituation hath his knees bent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and his whole leg frameth a kind of Arch or Bow, leſs or more according as it is Arched; this imperfection proceedeth commonly from exceſſive labour, which hath cauſed the nerves or back ſinews to contract or ſhrink up, ſo that the Legs remain Arched, and tremble beneath them, when they are made to ſtop after they have been rid a little; ſuch kind of Horſes are not abſolutly uſeleſs, becauſe they may work not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of it, but for my part I would not meddle with them at any rate, unleſs they had extraordinary good Reins, and then they may ſerve well for a while, but they ſhall never be fit for a Maſter; and although there have been ſome of them known to have laſted a long time with ſuch Arched Legs, yet they are alwayes unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the ſight, and a man can never expect to get rid of them, beſides that there are but very few People that have a fancy to buy them, how good and ſerviceable ſoever they may prove.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniſh Horſes, are for the moſt part either leſs or more arched in their Legs, as they are brought old from <hi>Spain,</hi> and that becauſe they alwayes ſhackle or fetter them in the Stable, which obliging them to ſtand wrong upon their Legs, maketh them through time become arched, although otherwiſe their Legs be good and ſound; and the Spainiards are ſo much taken with this method of ſhackling their Horſes, that ſo they may ſtand peaceably and no wayes hurt themſelves by ſtricking or other wiſe, that they fetter ſome Horſes, eſpecially ſuch as are very vitious and troubleſome, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind as before, but after another manner, for behind the ſhackles are ſeparate, and not joined together with a chain, as thoſe made uſe of for the Fore-legs are.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Barbary</hi> at <hi>Tunis, Algeirs,</hi> and other places, their Horſes are alwayes tyed with ſhackles, which they put both upon their fore and hind paſterns, and which are faſtned to ſtakes that are placed in the ground near to their Legs, neither are they almoſt ever tyed by the head or neck as ours are, becauſe for the moſt part they make never uſe of a Halter, neither in the Stable, nor in the Meadows, when the Horſes are a Graze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which are Foaled with arched Legs, and are not much the worſe of them for ſervice; they are called in French, <hi>Braſſicours,</hi> the only difference between theſe and the former, is that theſe have their Legs naturally arched, whereas the other are made ſo by great labour and fatigue, and are conſequently the worſt of the two; I have ſeen ſeveral of them, which notwithſtanding of this natural imperfection were very good and vigorous, and travelled well in the Countrey, having their Legs as ſure and truſty, as if they had been well ſhap't; but unleſs a man can have them at a very eaſy rate, I would never adviſe him to buy Horſes that are thus naturally arched in the Legs, and if he do, he would be alſo ſure that they are ſo naturally, and not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by labour or fatigue; I have alſo ſeen Coach-horſes, which although they had their Legs naturally arched, yet did ſerve very well and alſo for a long time.</p>
                     <p>A perſon who underſtood very well what belonged to Horſes, and knew how to diſtinguiſh the ſtrong from the weak and feeble, aſſured me, that thoſe Foals which have the veins of their Legs very big and large, are neither ſo good nor fit for ſervice as others, becauſe thoſe Veins become filled with a ſuperflous Blood, which by an agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſioned by labour degenerats into putrefaction, or breed a kind of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, very ſubject to prove prejudicial to the Legs upon many accounts; I have never as yet made tryal of this obſervation, however ſince the time I received it from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I found it in the Works of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who writ very well of Horſes conſidering the time wherein he lived.</p>
                     <p>Having exactly obſerved the three preceeding imperfections, to wit, whether a Horſe be ſtraight upon his Members, long jointed, or have arched Legs, all which may be perceived in the twinkle of an eye; you muſt next paſs your hand all along the back ſinew of the Fore-leg, from the very bending of the knee to the paſtern joynt, and you ſhall obſerve if the Sinew be large, firm, and detatched or well ſeparate from the bone, if in paſſing your hand alongſt it, you find no hardneſs which ſtoppeth your hand, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the back Sinew and Bone you meet with no moveable kind of jelly, which ſlips from beneath your Fingers as you are paſſing them along; for whatever hindereth, or is an impediment to the motion of the Back-Sinews, is more or leſs prejudicial to the Horſe, according to the quantity there is of it, and the greater diſtance there is between the Sinew and the bone, the broader will the Leg be, which is what is look't for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Legs which are broadeſt and flatteſt, are according to the opinion of the moſt skilful alwayes the beſt; now to have a broad and flat Leg, is to have the Back-ſinew well ſeparate, and at a pretty good diſtance from the ſhank bone.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:179659:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes, which although they have the Back-ſinews of their Fore-legs ſome what ſeparate from the Bones, yet their Sinews are ſo ſmall and ſo little detatched, that with a very ordinary labour or fatigue, the Legs become round, ſo that how little humour ſoever falls down upon them, yet if it there ſettle and grow hard, the Legs immediatly become round with it, which is not ſo when the Sinews are very well ſeparate from the Bones; for as there is a conſiderable diſtance between them, ſo the humour is with the more eaſe diſſipat and diſolved, the reaſon of this is too evident to need a further explication, I ſhall therefore only ſay, that thoſe Legswhoſe back Sinews are only a very little ſeparate from the bones although they be really detatched, are called <hi>Veal</hi> or <hi>Ox Legs,</hi> becauſe their back Sinews are alwayes too ſmall in proportion to the bigneſs of the reſt of the Leg, or Shank-bone; all this I have immediatly diſcourſed of deſerves a ſerious Reflection.</p>
                     <p>You are next to obſerve, if the back Sinew doth not quite fail as it were, juſt beneath the ply or bending of the knee, which is known, in ſo far as the great back Sinew which maketh the whole motion of the leg, diminiſheth conſiderably of its big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs juſt beneath the bending of the knee, for in the moſt part of legs, although the back Sinew be large and otherwiſe firme, to wit all along the back ſide of the fore thigh and ſhank bone, yet it alwayes falleth a little ſmaller beneath the ply or bending of the knee, but in ſome that ſmalneſs is too conſiderable; indeed the back Sinews ſhould not be ſo big near to the bending of the knee, as it is in the middle of the the ſhank, but in ſome Horſes it diminiſheth ſo extraordinarly, that in that place it is no biger then ones Thumb, or otherwiſe it is ſo fixed to the bone, that it doth but very little appear; this is an imperfection to which few people take Notice, and which alſo conſiderably impaireth the ſtrength of the leg, and thoſe Horſes which have their Back-ſinews ſo very ſmall near to the plye or bending of their knee, are for the moſt part very Subject to ſtumble, or at leaſt to trip and ſtrick with their Toes againſt the ſtones.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſides of the paſtern joynts both within and without, their cometh a ſoft ſwelling about half the bigneſs of a pigeons egg, leſs or more, and when a Man touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it he will perceive that it is full of water; this kind of ſwelling is called a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall in French <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne molette;</hi> and is commonly lodged between the Sinew and bone of the paſtern-joynt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe wind-galls are eaſily perceived by the Eye without feeling them, they are a token that the Horſe hath Laboured and fatigued much, but are not very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall unleſs they be hard and painfull, however it is enough that they ſhew us that the legs have been too much uſed, and that their ſtrength is diminiſhed, becauſe that concurſe of waters which form the wind-gall, diſcovers that there is a weakneſs in that part; if the wind galls be hardned they will in a ſhort time lame the Horſe; there cometh frequently wind-galls to Horſes upon a journey, which go away again with a little reſt, theſe are but ſmall wind-galls; but whatever way they come they are no ways agreeable to the Eye, and people ſay of ſuch Horſes that they are <hi>Wind-gali'd;</hi> they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the legs are uſed, but all legs which are fatigu'd and uſed, are not wnd-gall'd, they are therefore the ſmall and long joynted legs which are more Subject to them than any other; many people who pretend to Skill in Horſes call wind galls <hi>Waters,</hi> becauſe they are a kind of water, ſhut up as it were in a bladder between the Skin and fleſh, but very impropperly, for the <hi>Waters</hi> in a Horſes legs, in French <hi>Les Eaux,</hi> is another kind of imperfection, of which I ſhall diſcover hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Some people know only to take away wind-galls for a certain time, to the end they may not hinder the Seal of their Horſes, becauſe a Man muſt be almoſt a perfect ignorant not to diſcover them, and when ever a Man perceiveth them he concludes that the Horſes legs are uſed, and he is much in the right on't; Therefore thoſe whoſe Trade it is to ſell Horſes, make it their buſieneſs to dry them up only for a time; you moſt endeavour to find it out by the hair, which is more ſmooth and ſlicked in that part than any other, and alſo by the leg which otherwiſe you will find to be uſed and ſpoylt, although the wind-galls themſelves do not at all appear; there cannot be a better obſervation than this, yet I have ſeen wind-galls ſo reſtricted and compreſſed, for a certain time only, that the moſt nicely Skilfull could ſcarcely diſcover them.</p>
                     <p>Let is now make a ſhort recapitulation, of what we have been ſaying concerning the Back-ſinews of the fore-legs; they ſhould then be big and large without ſwelling, firm without being ſtiff, and very will detatched and ſeparate from the bone; thoſe Horſes whoſe Back-ſinews are very ſmall, are ſoon ſpoylt, and with the leaſt fatigue there legs appear uſed and round; a leg can never appear broad and flat with a ſmall Back-ſinew; a Sinew which is right, is without hardneſs or ſwelling, and when you preſs it with your hand, the Horſe ſhould not feel the leaſt pain.</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:179659:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>I have ſeen your light kinde of Horſes have a ſort of wind-galls, which made them halt when they travelled among Snow, and in the time of great Froſts; another kind of Wind-galls again which ſwelled and covered ſo the Back-ſinews, that their could never any remedy be got for them but fireing; Therefore Horſes which are troubled with Wind-galls are not much to be truſted to, becauſe of the many Accidents which befall them; now it is of the fore-legs which are Wind-galled that I am diſcourſing, for it is not ſo very ordinary for a Horſe to halt with them in his hind.</p>
                     <p>Turning your hand, you ſhall feel all a long the fore-part the ſhank-bone, from the knee, downward, to find if there be any <hi>Splints, Oſſelets</hi> or little bones, <hi>Fuzies,</hi> or <hi>pegg'd Splints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is fit that I explaine theſe four imperfections; and firſt a ſimple ſplint, in french <hi>Sur-os,</hi> which is the moſt common, is a callous excreſcence or kind of Griſle adhering to the ſhank-bone, and cometh commonly upon the inſide of it; but if there be one alſo on the outſide of the ſhank bone oppoſite to that upon the inſide, then it is called a pegg'd or pinn'd ſplint, in french <hi>Sur-os Chevillez,</hi> becauſe the one being over againſt the other, they peirce as it were, the ſhank-bone like to a pegg or pin, and are abundantly dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe ſimple ſplints, which are only faſtned to the bone at a pretty diſtance from the knee, and without touching the Back-ſinew, are not very dangerous, but thoſe that are ſo placed that they touch the Back-ſinew, make the Horſe in a ſhort time to halt; nevertheleſs any ſimple ſplints, will with long and violent exerciſe mount to the very knee, and when they come that length, then they are to be Suſpected.</p>
                     <p>Some people maintain that a Splint doth not mount upwards, but that it only lengthens and extends it ſelf to the very knee, ſo that it thereby interrupts the motion of the Leg; but what way ſoever it cometh thither, it is certain that a ſplint joining to the knee, lameth alwayes the horſe.</p>
                     <p>Every Horſe which hath a ſplint, ſhould be leſs valued than if he wanted it, and ſo proportionably if he have two; for it is an imperfection to have them, let people ſay what they will, or if they pleaſe make no account of them at all; indeed in Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes the imperfection is not ſo conſiderable, as in theſe only deſigned for the Sadle.</p>
                     <p>Horſes have in the ſame place where the Splints come, that which we call Fuzies, in french <hi>Fuſees,</hi> which are nothing elſe but two ſplints joined by the ends the one above the other; theſe Fuzies are a great dale more dangerous than a ſimple ſplint, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would never buy a horſe which had them.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which have little bones or hard excreſcences in the Knees, called in French <hi>Des oſſelets,</hi> which is an imperfection not very common, and is ſo much the more difficult to be diſcovered, becauſe they appear to be of the very ſame ſubſtance with the reſt of the knee; that you may the better come to underſtand them, you muſt know that an Oſſelet, is as it were a very big or large ſplint juſt upon the Knee, and without having a little experience, a man will be apt to take it for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it's ſelf of the Knee-bone, which deſcends lower upon one ſide of it than upon the other, about the breadth of two fingers or thereby; you are therefore when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this deformity which <hi>Choques</hi> the ſight, to conclude that is that excreſcence upon the Knee called an Oſſelet; for without it, it was never yet known that the ſubſtance of the Knee, did deſcend more upon the one ſide of the Shank-bone, than upon the other; theſe Oſſelets grow alwayes upon the inſide of the knee but never upon the out, and there are ſome Horſes which have two of them one upon each Fore-leg: if the Seller of ſuch a Horſe would rebait to me the half of his juſt value, I would not buy him with this fault; I once ſaw a Horſe which had thoſe Oſſelets or Excreſcences, and yet did not halt with them, but was good, Vigorous, and very Serviceable, the hazard is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever too great to be ventured upon.</p>
                     <p>I have in the Treatiſe of Diſeaſes, part ſecond, Chap: 37, explained the Origine, matter, and humour, from whence all ſplints do proceed, to which you may have recourſe, if you deſire to be more fully inſtructed in this point.</p>
                     <p>Now here is the Method whereby you may come to know a Splint, and how many kinds there are of them; the firſt is the ſimple Splint only adhering to the Bone of the Leg, which doth not at all touch the Back-ſinew, and is alſo at a pretty diſtance from the knee; the ſecond is the pegg'd Splint, which is when there are two Splints, the one upon the out, and the other upon the inſide of the Leg, juſt oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if they were pinn'd together through the Leg, from which they have their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Pegg'd; the third is the ſplint which aſcendeth to the very knee, and almoſt alwayes maketh a Horſe to halt; the fourth is the Fuzie, which is two ſplints joyned
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179659:44"/>at the ends, and one above the other; and the laſt is the little bony Excreſcence, or Oſſelet, which is upon the Knee, and may be taken for the very ſubſtance of the Knee it's ſelf, if a man have not all the greater experience; now excepting the ſimple ſplint, a horſe which hath any of the reſt is worth little or nothing, ſeing they diminiſh the greateſt part if not the whole value of the horſe: but me thinks I hear ſome <hi>Miſanthrop,</hi> Grumble at the many Repetitions made in this Diſcourſe of Splints, and other imperfections incident to Horſes; if this trouble and vex him, I out of true friendſhip adviſe him to read no more of this book, becauſe he will meet with many ſuch Repetitions, neither is this the only fault in it, and that which is worſt of all for him, is that in all appearance I ſhall not help it, becauſe ſtill as a Man grows old he delighteth the more in Recitals.</p>
                     <p>There cometh in the bending of the Knee, a Crevice or Chop, which is called the <hi>Mallender,</hi> it oft-times maketh the leg benummed and ſtiff at the firſt coming out of the Stable, yea it is alſo ſome-times ſo painfull that it maketh the Horſe halt, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> old Horſes it keepeth alwayes their Legs ſtiff; the <hi>Horſe Courſers</hi> think they give a Horſe a great commendation, when they ſay he hath the Mallenders, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reaſon for what they ſay upon one account, becauſe the ſharp and bad humour which occaſions them, is expelled through that channel or conduit which would prove very prejudicial to the Horſe, did it take it's courſe along the Nerves or back Sinews; but otherwiſe they are Ridiculous, in ſo far as it were much better that the Horſe had not that humour which occaſioned the Mallender, and ſo he would be free of them; every Horſe of value which hath a Mallender ſhould be the leſs eſteemed for it, and as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh old hath his Legs much more pained with it, and always halts at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſtable.</p>
                     <p>Although I have already ſpoke of the paſtern joynts in diſcourſing of arched Legs, yet I think it will be fit to ſay one word more of them in this place; The paſtern joints then are very conſiderable parts of the Legs by which a man may know if they be ſpoilt, for beſides the Windgalls which come upon the ſides of them and are very conſpicuous, a man ſhould alſo obſerve if they be no wayes ſwelled, becauſe if they appear bigger then uſual, it is a certain ſign that the Legs are uſed and ſpoilt.</p>
                     <p>The paſtern joint is alſo ſometimes <hi>Crowned</hi> as we ſay, that is, that without any wayes being galled or hurt, there is a ſwelling goeth round it beneath the Skin in forme of a Circle, and about half the breadth of ones finger; that humour hath gathered there through Travel, and hath congealed in that part of the paſtern joint in forme of a Circle or Ring, and beneath the Skin, which is a ſign that the Horſes Legs are uſed.</p>
                     <p>There cometh upon the ſide of the paſtern joint, either upon the in or outſide, and ſometimes alſo before, a ſwelling about the bigneſs of half a Walnut, which is ſoft and yeeldeth to ones finger when preſſed, neither doeth it make the Horſe halt; It is not called a Wind-gall, neither is it one, for it is not lodged as they are, commonly between the Nerve and Bone, but only beneath the skin; neither is it alſo filled with water as a Wind-gall, but full of a viſcuous matter; you are not therefore to miſtake and confound the one with the other, but you are to know that this is a ſign that the Leg is uſed, and that a part of that humour which occaſioned the ruine of the leg, hath gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together upon the paſtern joynt and formed that ſwelling; if you find a Horſe which hath this ſwelling, do not buy him in hopes to diſcuſs it, for you will find I aſſure you a great difficulty to do it without fireing, which will alſo mark and Scarrify the paſtern joynt; I have in the ſecond part of this Book, given reſolving remedies for diſcuſſing this kind of ſwelling, but I do not poſitively promiſe that they will abſolutly diſſipate it; now it is not that this kind of ſwelling doth verie much prejudice, for I have known Horſes which have had it and yet have ſerved two or three years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being much incommoded by it, or it's ever becoming bigger, but it is prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the ſale, and as every thing alarms half skilled perſons, therefore they Suſpect it, although in it's ſelf it be really nothing elſe, but a ſign that the Leg is uſed.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall likewayes add here, that you would alſo take care not to buy ſuch Horſes as have very ſmall paſtern-joynts, for they are not capable to fatigue much, becauſe the paſtern-joynts being weak, the Horſe doeth immediatly become wearied, by reaſon of the little ſtrength he hath in that part.</p>
                     <p>Below the paſtern joynt and in the very paſtern, you muſt feel if there be not that which is called in French a <hi>Forme,</hi> which is a ſwelling ſituate in the ſubſtance of the paſtern, and not upon the skin, therefore you muſt not be deceived by it, becauſe you will ſometimes find ſwellings and hardneſſes, which are only fixed upon the skin, and are not at all what we call <hi>Formes,</hi> but are either a button of the farcy, or ſome other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179659:44"/>kind of ſwelling not very material, being not at all fixed to the ſubſtance of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Forme</hi> is quite another thing, for it is a conſiderable imperfection, which lameth the Horſe unleſs it be taken care of in time, and beſides that it maketh a Horſe to halt, I think it is alſo ſo very dangerous an imperfection, that it ſhould make the Horſe be rejected for good and all, how beautiful and apparently good he may otherwiſe ſeem to be; the <hi>Formes</hi> come as well in the Hind-legs as in the ſore, and althouh it be an imperfection which is not very common, yet it is of conſequence, and there is no other remedy for it but fireing, and taking out the Horſes ſole, and the Fire is alſo with very great difficulty and danger applyed to that place where it cometh; to be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed how to know a <hi>Forme,</hi> turn forewards to the 46 Chap. of the ſecond part, where the method of curing them is diſcourſed of.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome other Marks, by which a man may know when a Horſes Legs are ſpoilt; firſt you muſt obſerve, if when ſtanding ſtill he cannot reſt equally upon his Legs, but ſometimes advanceth the one and ſometimes the other, to give himſelf eaſe, alſo being in the Stable he will ſometimes only advance one Leg, and continue it ſo for a pretty time, which they call in French, <hi>montrer le chemin de St Jacques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not but that there are ſome Horſes, which although they have very good Legs, yet ſhift from one to the other; but if it be only occaſioned by fretting or reſtleſneſs, and not to give themſelves eaſe by it, as thoſe do which have their Legs uſed, a man can conclude nothing from that poſture; for there are Horſes as there are Men, which can never plant themſelves right upon their Legs, although they be neither weary nor ſpoilt; theſe kind of Horſes point out alwayes the <hi>chemin de St jacques,</hi> or advance ſtill one of their Legs when in the Stable: You are therefore beſides this obſervation, to take notice to thoſe I have before diſcovered to you, and not to rely upon this ſingle one, whereby to judge if a Horſes Legs be oppreſſed and uſed; I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes plant themſelves very badly upon their Legs when ever they were kept ſtill, that is, which gave themſelves eaſe by advancing one of their fore-legs more than the other, and had nevertheleſs their Legs true and good, and never made a falſe ſtep, which is worthy of conſideration; therefore when you ſee a Horſe perform this action, you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve every thing elſe about his Legs, to know perfectly if they are oppreſſed, uſed, or ſpoilt, which are all much about one.</p>
                     <p>Other Horſes again reſt themſelves upon three Legs, without having any of them in the leaſt ſpoilt, and it is but to give eaſe to one of their hind Legs, by leting only the Toe of that hind Leg touch the ground, which is nothing but a ſign of wearineſs; but if he ſhould advance one of his Fore-legs and only point it to the ground, it would be a very bad ſign, becauſe it will ſignify that he is pained in that Leg; but making the other poſture upon three Legs, it is only a token that the Horſe is perhaps wearied, without being of any bad conſequence for his hind quarter.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179659:45"/>end; but before you cauſe walk any Horſe, you muſt obſerve, if when he is ſtanding ſtill, he be right planted upon his Limbs, becauſe upon the right or wrong <hi>Camping</hi> of a Horſe when he is ſtanding ſtill, doth depend notwholly, but in a great part his good or bad going and carriage: Now the natural ſituation of the Legs ſhould be larger or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above than below, that is to ſay, the diſtance which is betwixt the one foot and the other, ſhould be leſs than that between the one of the fore thighs and the other, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and at that part of them which is next to the ſhoulders; the knees ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline too much to other, or be too cloſe one upon the other, but the whole Leg ſhould deſcend in a ſtreight line to the very Paſtern joynt; the feet being placed upon the ground, ſhould be turned neither out nor in, but the Toe pointing directly forewards; being ſituate or camped after this manner, he will be very well plauted on his Legs, and all this may be obſerved when he is at reſt and ſtanding in the Stable.</p>
                     <p>As for the Hind-hand, his jarrets or hams ſhould not be too cloſs together, and if they are, then he will be crooked or bowed, called in French, <hi>un Cheval crochu,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the term the Horſe Courſers give it, they ſay that ſuch a Horſe is only a little too much cloſed behind; the hind-leg, or rather that part called the inſtep, which is betwixt the Hock and Paſtern joynt, ſhould ſtand perpendicular to the ground; if it ſtand fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or as it were under his Belly, the ſituation of it is bad, but if it ſtand ſtopping a little backwards from the perpendicular line, (and be ſo ſituate as when a Horſe is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtale or piſs,) it is no bad ſtance, but then commonly ſuch Horſes have too long Haunches, which is a deffect for the manage, becauſe it is with a great dale of difficulty that they can aſſemble themſelves and goe upon their Haunches, but they have for the moſt part always a good walk or Raik, although the fore parts be the ſooner ſpoilt and ruined by it; upon the contrary again, thoſe Horſes whoſe Haunches, Hams, and In ſteps are altogether ſtreight, that is, whoſe hind legs towards the feet fall not far enough back when ſtanding ſtill, I ſay ſuch Horſes can but with difficulty raik or walk well; moreover if the hind Paſtern joynt be ſo placed either to one ſide or forewards, as if it were diſlocate, ſuch ſituations are nought; he ſhould likewiſe plant his hind feet fla upon the ground, and not reſt only upon his Toes, as thoſe Horſes which are called in French <hi>Chevaux Ramptins;</hi> you muſt alſo obſerve if he turn the toes of his hind fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the more reaſon will you have to conclude that he is a bad Horſe, whatever other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications he may have.</p>
                     <p>This much of the ſituation in which a Horſe ſhould moſt commonly place himſelf when ſtanding ſtill; let us now proſecute the reſt, and obſerve his ſtep or walk; you muſt then cauſe ſtep him forewards to know if he be not lame, for if he be, it will be to no purpoſe to examine him further, few People buying Horſes which are nottarly known to be lame.</p>
                     <p>You muſt cauſe ride the Horſe at a foot pace, that you may have the more time not only to conſider if he walk well, but alſo if his Legs perform the actions which they ought; now for a Horſe to walk well, his ſteps ſhould be quick, that is, he ſhould not make in his walk ſlow and debile motions with his Legs, but ſhould move them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and make two times with them in the ſpace that many Horſes mark but one; thus he will walk more commodiouſly, fatigue himſelf leſs, and his rider will be more eaſed and comforted by it: After having made this general view, you are to obſerve that for a Horſe to go well, he ſhould have the Raiſing or lifting up of his Leg, the Stay or keeping of it up, and the Tread or ſetting of it down, all good; theſe are called in French, <hi>Le Lever ou hauſſer, le Soûtieu, et L'appuy;</hi> now becauſe this is a kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage not underſtood by every Perſon, I ſhall explain each term by it ſelf as followeth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lever,</hi> raiſing, or lifting up of a Horſes Legs when he is walking, will be good, if he perform it hardily and with eaſe, not croſſing his Legs the one over the other, nor carrying his feet either too much out or in, and that he alſo bend his knees as much as is needfull; this is for the <hi>Lever</hi> or raiſing of his Legs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Soûtien,</hi> ſtay, or keeping of them up, is good, when after that his legs are raiſed, he keepeth them up ſo long as he ought, the reſt of his body and head remaining in a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179659:45"/>good poſture; a man may know when a Horſe hath not the ſtay, or keeping up of his leg good, when he perceives him ſet it down ſuddenly to give eaſe to his other leg, in which he is perhaps either pained or hath a weakneſs; ſome Horſes alſo appear as if their noſes were always a going to the ground, and of theſe it may be very juſtly ſaid, that the ſtay or keeping up of their Legs in the Air is nought, and that their legs are weak and pained; this much of the <hi>Soûtien,</hi> or ſtay of a Horſes Legs in the Air, which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing to be conſidered in a Horſes going.</p>
                     <p>In the third and laſt place you are to conſider the <hi>Appuy,</hi> or ſetting down of the Legs or rather feet, upon the ground, commonly called the Tread, which to be good ſhould be firm, vigorous, and ſtreight, and without reſting upon one ſide of the foot more than upon the other, or ſetting down the toe or heel the one before the other, but that both be done at one and the ſame time, and when the foot is placed upon the ground, that it be turned neither out nor in, but perfectly ſtreight; that the Paſtern alſo be neither too much plyed, nor too ſtiff or ſtreight, for beſides that the firſt is a ſign of weakneſs in that part, the Horſe alſo becauſe of it becometh ſooner wearied, and will be very ſubject to have Wind-galls; again, if his Paſtern be too ſtiff and ſtreight ſet, he will become ſoon <hi>Boulete</hi> (as the French call it) which is to have his Paſtern joynts bending forwards as if they were diſlocate; now if a Horſe have his tread as I have been deſcriving, he will have it according to the rules of Horſemanſhip.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe performe theſe three Actions, his head continuing firm and elevate, then is it a ſign that his Legs are good, and that he walks well.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe of the Lever, the Soutien and the Appuy, or raiſing, keeping up, and ſetting down or tread of the foot, is a kind of Cant or <hi>Jargon</hi> not very common, for I my ſelf am the inventer and contriver of this kind of Language, which expreſſeth well enough the different times or actions, which ſhould be obſerved in a Horſes walk; till now People only ſaid, that a Horſe walked right and ſound; but it is in my opinion much better explained, by the Raiſing, Keeping up, and Setting down of the leg, and I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſuch Perſons who intend to become Skilfull, ſhould make a particular diſtinction of theſe three Actions, becauſe upon the exact obſervation of them, doth the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Horſes good or bad walk, and even of his vigour and ſtrength depend: Now in theſe three Actions, you are to obſerve if a Horſe in raiſing, and ſetting down again his Fore-legs, croſs the one over the other, which is very dangerous, not only for knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one Leg againſt th' other, and cutting, but likewiſe for ſtumbling and even falling in his Gallop or Courſe; alſo if the Horſe ſet his heels to the ground a little before his Toes, then is it a ſign that he is founder'd in the feet, but if he ſhall ſet his Toes firſt to the ground, then will it be a token that he hath been a draught Horſe; therefore that the ſetting down of the Leg or Tread may be good, the whole foot ſhould be ſet down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, and at one and the ſame very inſtant of time.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes, which although they have the raiſing, keeping up, and Tread of the Foot very good, yet they have a bad walk; therefore it is not altogether enough to conſider in a walk theſe three Actions of the Leg above ſpecified, but you muſt alſo obſerve if the Horſe walk <hi>Lightly, Surely, Quickly,</hi> and <hi>Eaſily;</hi> here are four Adverbs, which expreſs all that the moſt Nice and Curious can wiſh for in a Horſes walk, and I am going to explain them, for the behoof of ſuch as deſire to be inſtructed, becauſe thoſe who are abundantly knowing already, have no need of it.</p>
                     <p>To walk quickly, is to advance conſiderably upon the ſtep; now every one is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge to know and determine whether a Horſe ſteps quickly, or advances but little and ſlowly upon his Walk, and therefore I ſhall at this time ſay no more of it.</p>
                     <p>For a Horſe to walk very lightly, he ſhould be light on the hand, that is, he ſhould not preſs or reſt too much upon the bit, but be alwayes Champing upon it, keep his head high, and move quickly his ſhoulders; a Horſe which walketh thus cannot be ſaid to be too much upon his ſhoulders, becauſe it is impoſſible but he muſt be upon his haunches if he walk as I have told you, and beſides all this, if a Horſe be not nimble and glib in the ſhoulders, but ſtiff, and want as it were the uſe of his Limbs, he ſhall never walk lightly nor eaſily, but be heavy and unweildy, and although ſome vigorous and mettl'd Horſes, which have ſtiff and unmoving ſhoulders, lift their Legs commonly high enough, and alſo ply and bend them very well, yet it is not ſuch Horſes which walk beſt, becauſe they doe not continue at it; neither do they walk nimbly nor eaſily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have all an uneaſie and hard ſet in their walk, which proceeds from the force and violence with which they raiſe and lift up their Legs, and they likewiſe become very ſoon wearied, by reaſon of what I told you, when I diſcourſed of ſtiff and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving ſhoulders; and alſo very much fatigue the Rider.</p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:179659:46"/>
                     <p>In theſe four conditions or qualities which I wiſh for in a Horſe, that ſo he may go well; which are to walk <hi>lightly, ſurely, quickly,</hi> and <hi>eaſily,</hi> there is a neceſſity that the motion of the ſtep be nimble and quick, that ſo the Horſe may walk lightly and eaſily, for he ſhall never walk lightly and eaſily, if his ſtep be ſlow, long, and too ſtretched, therefore a Horſe ſhould remove his Legs often, without making a clattering motion with his feet, or beating the duſt as we ſay, for to ſtep ſhort and ſwift, is very far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from trampling, or making a clattering motion with the feet.</p>
                     <p>When I diſcourſed of the Raiſing and keeping up of the Leg, I forgot to tell you that thoſe Horſes which raiſe their Legs higheſt, and alſo ſtay them longeſt in the Air, are not the moſt propper for the Walk, nor thoſe which go beſt, for upon the contrary they ordinarly walk very badly, ſlowly, and uneaſily; ſuch Horſes are called vain and proud Horſes, in Spaine <hi>Piſsadors,</hi> which is indeed a very becoming action in a Horſe under a King. Prince, or General of an Army, who ſhew themſelves to the People or to their Souldiers, upon a review, or day of Parade; for it would ſeem that the Horſe, by that keeping up or long ſtay of his Leg in the Air, is high ſpirited, and vain of the honour he hath to carry his Maſter, and that he on purpoſe retards his Walk, that he may give the longer time to the ſpectators to view and conſider his Rider; ſuch kind of Horſe make alſo a very good figure in a mannage, for they are brisk and lively, their Gallo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:179659:46"/>
                     <p>Morover, a long Horſe advances more in his gallop with one ſtroke, than a ſhort does with two, and alſo cuts the double of the way without augmenting his Labour, ſeing they make both their motions at the ſame time; nevertheleſs long Horſes have for the moſt part leſs ſtrength, and become ſooner low and out of caſe than ſhort: In fine, as they are more commodious and eaſie than the ſhort, ſo one may ſay that they are the moſt proper Horſes for great people and Princes.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of moſt part of people is to be admired, in that they will pretend to know if a Horſe goes well, by obſerving if when walking he overpaſſes the Tread of his fore-foot very much with his hind, which is a moſt ridiculous miſtake, and ſhould be joyn'd with that of paſſing the hand before a Horſes Eyes, to know if he have a good ſight.</p>
                     <p>Moſt part of Horſes which thus overpaſs with their hind-foot the Tread of their fore, if they do it conſiderably, ſwing their Groupe from one ſide to t'other, and Rock, which is contrary to thoſe conditions we required in a good Walk; Beſides ſuch Horſes commonly <hi>Forge,</hi> that is, that with the ſhoes of their hind feet they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thoſe of their fore, and ſo pull them off upon the road, neither have they any Reins or Mettle; this is the ſignification of forgeing, and the qualities of ſuch Horſes as are guilty of it, ſo you ſee it is but a bad enough mark, whereby to know if a Horſe walketh well.</p>
                     <p>I don't deny but a Horſe which thus overpaſſes with his hind foot the tread of his fore, may walk ſwiftly, but ſuch a Horſe will have rarely good Reins, neither can he go eaſily, becauſe he hath not a quick, but long and ſtretched ſtep all upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which will make him ſo much the more ſubject to ſtumbling, becauſe he is not ſupported by his Reins.</p>
                     <p>This obſervation which is made of a Horſes overpaſſing much with his hind foot the tread of his fore, is ſo much a better remark to know if he ambles well, as it is bad for knowing if he walk well; for it is certain that a Horſe can never amble upon his haunches nor go well, if he doe not with his hind feet overpaſs the treads of his fore, at leaſt a foot, or a foot and a half, and the more he overpaſſes the better will he amble, which is quite contrary to the walk, and ſo is alſo the way of removing his legs in theſe two Actions quite different; for in the amble he lifts both the legs of one ſide, and has them both in the Air at one and the ſame time, but in the ſtep or walk he lifteth them Croſs; for example, in a walk he lifts the near fore-leg and far hind-leg together, and has them in the Air at the ſame time, and when he ſets them down, he lifts the other two which were croſs upon the ground, to wit his far fore-leg and near hind-leg, and ſo alternative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly each remove; this is the true motion of a Horſes Legs upon a walk, which is the ſame with that of the Trot, although the paces are different: <hi>Our author is here us a little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take anent the motion of a Horſes Legs in the Walk, to convince you of which, I referr you to the Supplement of Horſemanſhip,</hi> Chap: 21.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe in walking ſhould not carry his Hams outward every ſtep that he maketh, for it is a ſign of weakneſs, and to which Horſes that amble are more ſubject than thoſe that only walk, but is not a leſs imperfection in the one than in the other; any Horſe which is deſign'd for galloping or the mannage, if he have this Imperfection of turning his Jarrets or Hams outwards in running, ſhall never ſucceed at it, for he cannot endure to be put upon his Haunches, and if he be not upon his Haunches, he cannot chuſe but be very diſagreeable.</p>
                     <p>Likewayes, a Horſe ſhould not in walking rub or ſtrike his Hams one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as thoſe which are bow-legged do, which is an action quite contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Bow-legged Horſes are commonly reputed ſwift and good, but they are not proper for Hilly Countreyes, and for the mannage they are altogether diſagreeable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all the conditions required in a Horſe to walk well, which are not the ſame with thoſe of a Galloper, for in the walk a Horſe ſhould ſet down his foot firmly without putting it down with force, which is quite contrary in a Gallop, for in it he ſhould ſcarcely touch the ground, that is, he ſhould Gallop ſo lightly as that it would ſeem he diſdained to touch it, and without doubt that is a token that he will Gallop long, becauſe of his performing it with ſuch eaſe; ſuch Horſes as gallop heavily ſet their Feet very rudely to the ground, ſo likewiſe do thoſe which go upon their ſhoulders, but theſe which Gallop upon their haunches does ſcarcely with their fore feet touch the ground; but it is not the ſame with Horſes which walk, for theſe which have the beſt and moſt nervous Legs, are them which ſet their feet moſt firmly to the ground, and with a kind of noiſe; however they muſt not put their feet ſo heavily and Rudely to the ground as if they were deſign'd for a Coach, which is a thing as eaſie to be underſtood as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:179659:47"/>it is difficult to be expreſſed: This is enough of the Gate or Walk, we muſt now proceed to the other imperfections, which we ſhall doe in the following Chapter, where I ſhall endeavour to make you know if a Horſe have good feet; for if he have not that part good, he will be ſoon ſpoilt, and his ſervice of no long continuance.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which although they have too long Haunches, yet commonly walk well, but their fore-quarters are quickly ruined, becauſe the hind preſſes upon it with ſo much violence, that the fore part cannot reſiſt it, ſuch Horſes are admirable for Hilly Countreys, for they Climb like Oxen, but to ballance that, they are no wiſe ſure upon a deſcent, for they cannot ply their hams; and a certain ſign of it is, that when they Gallop they can never perform it ſlowly, but almoſt always at full ſpeed, becauſe they cannot ſo ply their Haunches beneath them, as to put them in a capacity to Gallop ſlowly: The Mannage is the greateſt ſtumbling block ſuch horſes have, for whatever good Reins they have, People have great difficulty to put them well upon their Haunches, and if ane Eſquire be not all the more skilfull I would not adviſe him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it; if he ſucceed it will be by chance, and perhaps once in his life time, and will take two years to cauſe him perform that, which another Horſe will do in three Months.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know when the haunches are too long, in that when the horſe is ſtanding in the ſtable, he Camps with his hind Feet farther back than he ought, and that the top or onſet of his Tail doth not anſwer in a perpendicular Line with the tips of his hocks, as it doth alwayes in horſes which have their haunches of a juſt length.</p>

                     <p>IN this Chapter,<note place="margin">CHAP XII. A further Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the faults and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Horſes.</note> I ſhall teach you to know the feet and what belongs to them, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good or bad Flank, and all which belongs to that knowledge; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chapters we have regularly conſidered ſome imperfections; my deſign in this place is not to diſcourſe of the Gallop, Amble, a good or bad mouth, and of the means to know every thing elſe, which a man ſhould conſider in the going of a horſe, as ſwiftneſs, and other good Qualities; that which oblidges me to take this method, is that I obſerve People alwayes conſider the faults and Imperfections we are going to diſcourſe of, before ever they cauſe either Run or Gallop a horſe; for it would be but loſt labour to advance ſo far, if a man perceived other faults which would hinder his buying him; and providing that I make the Reader underſtand them all, it is no great matter in what part of the Book I do it.</p>
                     <p>There are four Marks which all Horſes have, and which few Authors make mention of, they are ſituate in the fore legs above the knees, and upon the inſides, and almoſt upon the back parts of the Hind-legs a little below the Hams; the part is without hair and reſembles a little peice of hard and dry horn, it is termed the <hi>Swimer,</hi> the Greeks call this part <hi>Licheues,</hi> and the French call it the <hi>Cheſnut,</hi> becauſe of the reſemblance it hath to One; the ſmaller this part is the mark is the better, becauſe it is a Token that the leg is dry and Nervous; in ſome Horſes this part as they grow old becometh hard as their Soles; people ſhave ſuch from time to time, becauſe if they pull them away, the Blood will follow, and there would remain a wound; Theſe Swimers proceed from Humidity, and there are ſome Horſes which have them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179659:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo very ſmall, that they can Scarcely be diſcerned, and they are the better for it.</p>
                     <p>This part is of ſmall conſequence, but a Man ſhould know every thing, becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made nothing in Vain; Horſes have upon the back parts of their fore and hind paſtern joynts, a kind of Round ſtub which reſembles a peice of Lender Horn, and about the bigneſs of a nut, they are alwayes covered with the little Tufts of hair, that are upon the back parts of the paſtern-joynts called the Petlocks; theſe ſtubs, or round little knobs, are of the ſame Nature which thoſe Swimers or Cheſnuts I was diſcourſing of, but the Swimers are commonly more dry, and ſo conſequently harder.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are Subject to the <hi>Peigues,</hi> or Crown Scab, which is a kinds of Itching ſcurf that cometh upon the Coronet of the hoof, and keers the Hair upon that part which is already Swelled, alwayes briſtly and ſtareing; there are two kinds of them, one is humid, and ſendeth forth ſeroſities through the pores, which ſome times encreaſe ſo abundantly, that they mount up to the very paſtern-joynt, cauſing a part of the hair to fall away where they come eſpecially if the humor be very ſharp; but if the Horſe Labour in dry grounds, than they dry up ſome times in the Summer time, ſo that ſcarcely any of the moſt humor can be perceived, but if the hair be faln of, then the part will remain bald and ugly; this laſt kind of Crown-Scab which cauſeth the hair fall, is only ſeen in old Coach-horſes, but rarely in Young.</p>
                     <p>The other kind is dry, and never expelleth any moiſture but only ſendeth forth this kind of itchy ſcurf, which maketh the hair to ſtare and keepeth the Coronet Swelled; I would not take a Horſe which had either of theſe imperfections, although they do not much hinder him to labour, unleſs the perſon who ought him diminiſhed conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably his price, and if he be a Horſe of value, he muſt be abſolutely rejected having them; people know this infirmity cheifly by the Coronets being Swelled, and full of that humor which occaſions the Crown-Scab; the Swelling is eaſily perceived by the Coronets being bigger and more Elevate than the reſt of the hoof; a Coach horſe with Crown-Scabs is worth nothing in a City.</p>
                     <p>This infirmity is as troubleſome as any a Horſe can have, for firſt they rarely recover of them, and beſides many perſons abſolutely reject them, ſo that you your ſelf are the laſt Maſter of the Horſe; when the Horſe-Courſers have any ſuch, they will tell you that their Horſes have been Labouring in ſtrong and clay ground, which hath occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hair upon their Coronets to briſtle; I am of the opinion that a man ſhould not give above eight pieces for ſuch horſes.</p>
                     <p>You are next to conſider, if the horſe you intend to buy have no <hi>Forme,</hi> which is a kind of Swelling upon the paſterns, this imperfection is not very common, and people rarely ſee it in Journey horſes, but only in thoſe which are appointed for the Coach and mannage; as it is of great conſequence a Man ſhould know it exactly; I have already diſcourſed of it a little, and believe what I am to repeat will not be altogether unneceſſar, ſeing every horſe which hath <hi>Formes,</hi> may be lookt upon to run a very great hazard of becoming lame.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Forme</hi> is a Swelling, which cometh as well in the paſterns of the hind as fore legs, above the Quarters of the foot both within and without, hard as the reſt of the ſubſtance of the paſtern, and even like a Griſſle, and it is not only upon the skin, but fixt to the Subſtance of the paſtern; it maketh a horſe to halt, and at laſt to become alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Lame; in the beginning it does not exceed half the bigneſs of a pigeons egg, but labour and exerciſe maketh it to become through time, about half the bigneſs of a hens egg, and the nearer it is ſituate to the Coronet upon the Quarters, ſo much the more dangerous is it.</p>

                        </gap> bad enough bargain, altho to tell the Truth, there is to be ſeen odd enough Varietie in the matter of Feet, for ſome will appear to be weak, when they are really good, and and the little horn that they have is tough, ſolid, and capable to ſerve, others again appear good, which are pained for being too fat and full of Fleſh; the ſureſt way then is to take them of a good ſhape, and where there is nothing to be complained of, and with the right method of ſhoeing, people recover thoſe that are bad, and the good they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in a condition.</p>
                     <p>A Man muſt be a good knower of Horſes, to judge exactly of certain kinds of feet eſpecially thoſe of Dutch Horſes, which come from <hi>Holland</hi> about the age of four or five years, for with difficulty can it be known if thoſe feet, which to many people appear good will not become in a little time very bad, as it frequently falleth out, either through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the foot, or fault of the Smith who ſhoeth them, or ſometimes both; therefore the ſureſt way is to chuſe them as I am going to ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>Let us begin with the hoof, which ſhould be of a form very near round, and not long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh eſpecially toward the heel, for long feet are worth nothing; the horn ſhould be Tough and Solid, High, Smooth, and of a dark colour, and if poſſible without any Circles; a Man may know thoſe that are brittle, when the Horſe by loſſing often his Shoes h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> ſpoilt his feet, by having many pieces broke from the horn around his foot, and ſeveral wants in it near to the Shoe, ſo that it doth not follow the exact ſhape of it; brittle hoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſplit in the places where the nails are rivetted, which ſometimes taketh away the very piece: a Man may alſo know a bad hoof by lifting up the foot, and conſidering if it have a ſhoe forged expreſly for it, and that it be pierced extraordinarly, and the holes of it placed in ſuch parts where it is not very uſual, that ſo they might ſhoe the horſe more conveniently, ſeeing he had not horn enough to take hold by, in thoſe parts where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Nails are driven; ſo people are conſtrained ſometimes to peirce the ſhoes near to the Heels, although they are for the fore-feet, it not being in their power to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; people commonly drive no Nails near to the Heels of the fore-feet, and when they do, it is becauſe the Toe is ſo much ſplit and broke, that they can place none in it.</p>
                     <p>Circles in Horſes hoofs, make a man know that they are altered, and if they quite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the feet and be higher then the reſt of the hoof, they make them halt, for they look as if one had put expreſly a Circle of horn in that place, to keep the hoof together; when a Man ſees that the foot is circled, although the Circle doth not make the Horſe halt or mean his foot upon the Street, yet it is a ſign that the hoof is either altered or that the nature of the horn is nought; therefore it muſt be conſidered very exactly and all the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken notice to, as firſt if the horn be thick, ſeeing thoſe horſes which have a thin horn are ſuch which are ſaid to have fat feet, and cannot be known but by ſeeing the foot pared, for in that caſe the horn will not only be thin, but the Sole alſo, by having but a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:179659:48"/>very little thickneſs; ſuch thin hoof'd Horſes halt and mean their feet a long time after they are ſhoed, before they recover ſtrength in them, ſo that a man is neceſſitat to let them reſt ſome dayes after they are ſhoed, before he can make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>To know exactly when feet are Fat, is one of the moſt difficult things in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Horſes, and I am of opinion few people can judge certainly of them, ſeing their ſhape is as beautiful as that of any other foot, and the horn maketh the beſt appearance and ſhew in the World, only that the hoof is ſomewhat bigger than ordinary, and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ſize of the Horſe will allow of.</p>
                     <p>You are moreover to conſider, if the Horſe have not a kind of clift in his foot, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Falſe-quarter,</hi> which is occaſioned by the Horſes caſting his quarter and getting a new one, for then the Horn beginning to grow is uneven and ugly, and bigger and ſofter than the reſt of the hoof; if the clift be conſiderable and take up a quarter of the foot, it ſhould keep a man from buying the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>There are Horſes which have over-reaches or calkin treads upon the coronet, which become hollow and groov'd in curing, but then the hollow of the Tread deſcends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as the hoof groweth, and is viſible upon it; it doth little or no prejudice to the Horſe, if there remain no ſwelling upon the Coronet.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Clifts very dangerous, for when Farriers have ſometimes fired the Coronet, and that they have burnt down a little upon the top of the horn, there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a clift or groove along the hoof, which renders it ugly and hard ſo long as his foot remaineth, and is conſiderably prejudicial to him, becauſe it commonly ſtraitens and dryeth up the foot in that part; however it is not at all dangerous to apply Rayes of Fire upon the hoof, providing that people do not burn the Coronet, yea it is ſo far from being dangerous, that it is very profitable upon many occaſions to perform it; for example, when a heel or quarter is ſo ſtraitned that it preſſes the little foot or coffin bone, a man in that caſe may in ſtead of grooving the hoof with a drawing Iron, with ſucceſs apply the Rays of Fire after the manner I have taught you in the ſecond part, Chap. 50. and 59. Therefore when people ſee a foot thus fired they ſhould not be much ſtartled at it, but only conclude that it hath been ſtraitned, and that thoſe Rayes of fire have been applyed to enlarge it.</p>
                     <p>You muſt now lift up the foot, the heel of which ſhould be pretty high, broad, large and open, that is, without being hoof-bound, which is to have it too narrow and ſtrait as I am going to ſhew you; you ſhall alſo at the ſame time conſider if the Frog, or Fruſh be of a largneſs proportionable to the foot, for if it be too little and dry it is a fault, and it is alſo one if it be too large and fat; Thoſe which are little and too much dryed up, fall to the ſhare of hoof-bound or narrow heel'd Horſes, becauſe the heels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtrait hinder the fruſh to be nouriſhed as it ought, and ſo it remaineth ſmall and ſtarved; when the fruſh is too large and fat, it is higher then the ſole at the heels, and is alwayes a token of a very bad foot.</p>
                     <p>The moſt part of Horſes which have low heels, have large and fat Fruſhes, ſo that they cannot walk but they touch the ground, and many times cauſe them halt, which ſhould be conſidered very carefully, becauſe the moſt part of people who underſtand ſhoeing, cauſe take down their Horſes heels to preſerve the back Sinews of their Legs, or for other Reaſons which I ſhall diſcourſe of hereafter; the Ignorant ſeing a heel cut and taken down after that faſhion, boldly pronounce that a Horſe hath none, but in that caſe you are to take notice to the Fruſh, which being but of a middle ſize, the Horſe can ſcarcely be too low heel'd; The tour and circumference of the hoof maketh one alſo know if the heels are low, if he have but a very little experience.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall in the next place, keeping always the Horſes foot up, conſider if the ſole be ſtrong, and the whole foot hollow, and at a pritty diſtance from the ſhoe; it is an excellent ſign in Coach-horſes to have hollow feet, and therefore you are to know that thoſe who ſell ſuch Horſes, that they may make their feet appear good, cauſe them to be made hollow by the Smith as much as poſſible, and ſo leave their ſole very thin and weak, and indeed by this a man may be deceived; but a foot ſhould be hollow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the ſole of it too much weakned and thin; to commend a foot people ſay that it will hold an Engliſh halt pynt of Wine, that ſo they may certainly know it is very hollow.</p>
                     <p>When the ſole is higher than the hoof, and that the whole foot is quite filled up upon the lower part, ſo that in ſtead of the foot being hollow the ſole is in a manner round and bilged, they are then called Crown'd-ſoles in French <hi>Pieds Combles;</hi> theſe kind of Feet have alwayes the upper parts of them framed like an Oyſter ſhell, that is, flat and ugly, and almoſt all feet faſhioned after this manner, have their heels although
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179659:49"/>low, yet ſtraitned and narrow towards the ſhoe, and become in a little time abſolutely uſeleſs, it not being poſſible without a great dale of difficulty to adjuſt their ſhoes to them, nor drive the Nails but at a great diſtance from the heels, that is, only at the Toe; ſuch Horſes are fit for nothing but the Plow; It is not but by methodical ſhoeing care, and time, ſuch high and Crowned Soles may in ſome meaſure be rectified, and alſo receive a pretty good ſhape, if the heels be only ſtraitned near to the ſhoe, as they are alwayes for the moſt part, and if they have not their Fruſhes over large and heels too low: for theſe laſt there is little or no poſſibility to recover them, but for the firſt whoſe hoof at the heel doth only ſtraiten near to the ſhoe, although their heels be low, yet the method of ſhoeing will recover them; I ſhall ſhow how it is to be done when I diſcourſe of ſhoeing, but becauſe people do not buy Horſes with faults which are to be rectified, and that Horſes are but ſubject to too many infirmities, I think a man ſhould endeavour to chuſe them with the beſt feet he can, becauſe they are the foundation of the Building; eſpecially for your large Dutch, and Frizland Horſes when a man ſees them have low heels and a high ſole, that is, which reſteth almoſt upon the ſhoe, or that they have large and fat Fruſhes, he ſhould never think of buying them, for I aſſure you they will create a great dale of trouble to him when they begin to change or <hi>Mew,</hi> for it is moſt certain that the Feet of ſuch Horſes change, and alter after they are brought to <hi>France,</hi> ſo that thoſe which are pretty good become bad, and thoſe which are are bad, do in <hi>Mewing</hi> become abſolutely uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>There are other kind of Feet which people call weak, becauſe although their heels be indifferent high, yet they are but thin, that is, that at the point of the Fruſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the upper part of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hoof-binding is known, when the heels do not take a right Tour or Compaſs, but ſtraiten towards the Clift of the Fruſh, ſo that upon each ſide of the ſaid clift, there is not above a finger breadth of diſtance, and that the whole heel is little more as two finger breadth; Whereas a Horſe ſhould have alwayes about four at the heel, but that is either a little more or leſs according to the ſize and bigneſs of the Foot.</p>
                     <p>There are narrow heel'd Horſes which have high heels, but ſo weak, that by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the two ſides of the heel one againſt the other they yeeld and move, which is a token of tenderneſs in the foot, and although the Horſe were not hoof-bound, yet ſuch yeelding heels are alwayes weak.</p>
                     <p>Some narrow heel'd Horſes have not high heels, but upon the contrary abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly low, but then that part of the hoof next to the heel, and which reſts upon the ſhoe, is much more ſtraitned than that which is next to the Cornet, and it is that which hoof-bindeth a Horſe; Now for theſe laſt the <hi>Panton</hi> or <hi>Pautable</hi> ſhoes have a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>There are Horſes which have the back parts of their paſterns next to the heels, as if they were pointed, and by that meanes have their feet too long, becauſe they exceed the ordinary roundneſs at the heel, and extend too much back-wards; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch have very bad feet, and are almoſt alwayes hoof-bound; They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that part of the paſterns too fleſhy and Subject to the <hi>Formes,</hi> which is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſufficient to make a man reject a Horſe and not to meddle with him, you are therefore by this to regulate your ſelfe as to the ſhape of the foot, that it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as near to a round form as poſſible, and that thoſe whoſe heels extend back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and have their foot almoſt of an ovall ſhape, have a bad figure of a foot for ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this fault in ſmall ſized Horſes of being hoof-bound, they are alſo Subject to have one of the ſides of their heels higher by an inch than the other; This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fault, but not altogether ſo bad as hoof-binding, becauſe beſides that hoof-binding doth for the moſt part make a Horſe to halt, it is alſo a token of a great dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the foot; Alſo bad ſhoeing may occaſion this of the heels being higher upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179659:49"/>one ſide than the other; neither is this imperfection incureable, but it is ſomewhat expenſive to performe it; it proceedeth partly from the aridity and dryneſs of the foot, and the method to prevent it, is to cauſe ſhoe and pair ſuch kind of feet each month, that ſo you may keep them from taking that bad ſhape; ſmall ſized Horſes which have narrow heels and which never ride in humid and wet ground, that ſo they may have occaſion to moiſten their feet, are moſt ſubject to this infirmity; I am of opinion that no man ſhould buy a Horſe of Value that is ſubject to it.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are hoof-bound, are alſo ſubject to have <hi>Seymes</hi> or clifts in their Quarters; Theſe two imperfectiones proceed from one and the ſame internall cauſe, which is the dryneſs of the foot; the externall cauſe proceeds from the Horſes Riding upon hard ground, or in ſtrong froſt, or by ſetting their feet with too much Violence to the ground, as thoſe Horſes do which trot upon the ſtreets having their legs ruined and ſpoilt, alſo by leaping upon a very ſoft ground, and many times alſo by gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too high, or making too great a motion with their legs; it is eaſy to perceive this imperfection by their walking, for they do not ſet down their feet firm upon the ground, and ſo their Tread is not ſuch as we have already deſcribed it ſhould, becauſe for the moſt part they alwayes halt with it; a foot which is of a right ſhape and well nouriſhed, will never be ſubject to <hi>Seymes</hi> or cloven Quarters, and very rarely do people ſee hoofs which are round and ſolid have any of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seymes</hi> or Cloven Quarters are known, by looking to the Quarters of the hoofs upon the inſide, which will be found cloven from the Coronet to the very ſhoe, quite thorow the horn, and ſuch Quarters are almoſt alwayes ſtraitned; ſome of theſe Clifts do not aſcend ſo high as the Coronet, and therefore are the leſs dangerous, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever although they may be recovered, it is a very conſiderable imperfection and yet a greater in fat feet which have a thin horne, where oftimes ſuch Clifts occaſion a <hi>javar Encorné</hi> as the french call it, or ſcratches upon the onſett or Coronet of the hoof, becauſe the matter which formeth in that part ſpoileth and corrupteth the <hi>Tenaon</hi> or Cartilage, which is the cauſe of a Coronet-ſcratch; the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe, and thoſe other I was diſcourſing of (which are the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) is that in thoſe which are the moſt common there gathereth no matter, but in theſe other there doeth; people know when the matter hath formed in a cloven Quarter, in that it appeareth upon the Coronet near to the hair, at which part the matter which hath its origine and ſource in the Cartilage, iſſueth forth and maketh the Horſe halt to the ground, ſuch cloven Quarters are as difficult to be cured as a crowned ſcratch, for they muſt be treated alter the very ſame manner; Although Horſes have only the moſt common kind of <hi>Seymes,</hi> yet they cannot work but in very ſoft and Carpet kind of ground, for upon a ſtreet or hard ground, they but criple upon them, and as they are walking, the Blood frequently cometh out of the Clefts; Cloven Quarters are alwayes a token of a dryed foot and bad temperature; A cloven Quarter is enough to make a Man reject a journey Horſe who hath it, but yet more one which is appointed for the Coach, and I am of opinion that the fault is aboundantly ſufficient to do it, unleſs the horſe be deſigned for a Rideing ſchool, where he may be recovered, but then he ſhould be alſo bought at a more eaſy rate.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the horn of the hind feet, cleaveth juſt in the very middle of the fore part of the hoof, from the Coronet to the Shoe; this imperfection is not very common, but it is very troubleſome, and maketh the horſe ſometimes halt; They are called <hi>Ox feet,</hi> in French <hi>Pieds de Boeuf,</hi> becauſe of their being cloven in the middle, after the ſame manner as the feet of Oxen are; Mules are more ſubject to this imperfection than Horſes, and it ſhould hinder the buying of them, eſpecialy if the clift be large, becauſe the ſand and clay mix and incorporate in it, and make them to halt by the pain it occaſions.</p>
                     <p>There is another imperfection to which the hoof and Coronet are ſubject, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in French <hi>Crapaudine,</hi> or Tread upon the Coronet, which is a kind of ulcer that cometh upon the Coronet, and from which there iſſueth a filthy ſort of matter, which by its ſharpneſs dryeth up the horn beneath the part where the tread is made, in which there is made a kind of hollow or groove down to the very ſhoe, and it would ſeem that the horn ſhrinketh in that part, by reaſon of that humour, which inſtead of moiſtning as it ought, changeth its nature by the corruption it receiveth from the wound made by the tread, and is the cauſe of this diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Horſes of mannage which do not croſs their legs enough in paſſaging, but knock and bit frequently their Coronets in one and the ſame place with the nails of their ſhoes, and may very readliy occaſion ſuch ulcers, of which they will halt very ill, if they be not lookt to and kept clean; however they are of no great conſequence, and come for the moſt part rather in the hind feet than in the fore.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:179659:50"/>
                     <p>It is a great imperfection, to have upon the one hand feet which are too large or fat, or upon the other to have them too little, ſuch Horſes as have them too big and large, are for the moſt part very heavy and but rarely light; when their feet are of that ſhape, they are likeways ſubject to loſe their ſhoes, and give no kind of agreeable ſervice.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> people ſell horſes for the Saddle, which they call <hi>Flandrins,</hi> from <hi>Flanders</hi> the name of the Country they came from, and becauſe they are well ſhapt and make a good appearance, although generally thoſe of them which are good, are very raſe, therefore they make ſuch paſs for <hi>Normandy</hi> Horſes; and we have not a more certain mark whereby to know theſe <hi>Flandrins,</hi> than by their big and large feet, for when once they have been made a little uſe of, they are but too well known for what they are, the moſt part of them giving always upon the leaſt toyl, a belch as they are ſpurred; too ſmall feet are very much to be ſuſpected, becauſe they are frequently painful, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cloven quarters and other imperfections we have been diſcourſing of; again, very big and large feet are alſo very incommode for Traveling in Tough and Clay high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, neither do they endure Fatigue, and the moſt part of Horſes which have them, ſtumble; but if with ſuch feet they have alſo weak Legs and too long paſterns, they ſhall never have great ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>There are other kinds of Feet, whoſe form and ſhape are ſomewhat extraordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their being foundered, ſo that the hoof towards the middle of the foot is ſhrunk and fallen in, hath many circles quite round the foot, and appears altogether altered and dry, with the heels all circled; A Horſe which hath ſuch kind of feet, that become ſtil worſe, ſets alwayes his heels firſt to the ground when he Trots, having the middle part of his hoof hollow, and the ſole high and round, after the form of <hi>Crownea-ſoles;</hi> There are alſo ſometimes extraordinary founderings which fall down upon the feet, and make them of ſuch an odd ſhape, that that form which they ſhould have above upon the hoof, they have beneath upon the Sole, ſo that the feet are in a manner renverſed; now all theſe bad kinds and ſhapes of feet ſhould be rejected.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving narrowly examined the feet of any Horſe you intend to buy,<note place="margin">CHAP: XIV How to know if a horſe be well belly'd</note> you muſt next conſider if he have a good Body and be full in the Flank, or if he want a Belly, all which ſignify but one and the ſame thing; but to ſpeak properly, a Man ſhould only ſay that a Horſe hath not a good Body, or a full Flank, for to ſay he hath no Gutts, is an expreſſion not much in uſe, although a man may very well ſay that a Horſe hath no Belly; therefore that I may be the better underſtood by all, I ſhall without prejudice make ſometimes uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>This imperfection may proceed from ſeveral cauſes which it will be fit to examine, that ſo you may with the more certainty judge of it, and prevent being deceived by it; and firſt if the laſt of the ſhort Ribs be at a conſiderable diſtance from the Haunch-bone, which is known by the great ſpace there is between that bone, and the laſt or hindmoſt Rib; now although ſuch Horſes may for the time have pretty good Bodies, yet when they come to any conſiderable labour or exerciſe, they abſolutely loſe it, and theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Horſes which have no flank.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe hath alſo no flank, when his Ribs are too ſtraitned in their tour or compaſs, which is eaſily perceived by comparing their height with that of the Haunch bones, for they ought to be as high and elivate as them, or but a very little leſs when the Horſe is Luſty and in good caſe, becauſe when he is lean and no fleſh upon his Ribs, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in that caſe appear ſo high and well raiſed as the Haunch bones.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:179659:50"/>
                     <p>The imperfection of being narrow cheſted, beſides that it hindreth a Horſe to have a good body, his wind and breathing is alſo never ſo very free, by reaſon of the laſt or hindmoſt Ribs ſqueezing and compreſſing too much the inward parts.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch Horſes as have their Ribs ſtrait, be great Feeders, then their Bellys will be gulped up, ſo that it not being poſſible for the Entrals to be contained within the Ribs, they will preſs downwards and make the ſhape of a Cows Belly which is very unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; beſides that thoſe Horſes that are ſtrait Rib'd, are very difficult to Saddle, for there muſt be Saddles made expreſly for them, they have no wind, and are ſubject to the Cough; But they have all of them for the moſt part a good Chine or Back.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſes not having a good Belly proceed from Leanneſs, or for having fatigu'd too much, it is not ſo much to be apprehended, eſpecially if his Ribs have a good turn or compaſs; for reſt and eaſe, with the aſſiſtance of cooling and moiſt nouriſhment, may come to recover him; Such Horſes as are naturally light Belly'd although otherwiſe fat and plump enough, cannot endure any great Fatigue; the precaution which people obſerve, in buying ſuch Horſes, is to take notice if they eat heartily their Hay and Oats, and drink luſtily, for then there is little to be feared; if you intend to make choice of a Horſe for Courſing or Galloping, he will be Lighter and Cleverer with ſuch a Belly, than if it were a great dale bigger.</p>
                     <p>However it doeth not follow of conſequence, that all lean Horſes are light Belly'd; 'tis true there are ſome to who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Leanneſs occaſions this diſorder, but there alſo a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which become Lean, and yet have as full a Flank and good Belly as can be deſired.</p>
                     <p>The true method to know a Horſe, which can but with difficulty be made to have a good Belly, is when you perceive him to be Luſty, and have a good dale of fleſh upon his Ribs, but little or no Flank; of ſuch a Man may ſay that they have naturally no Flank, and with difficulty can be made to have a good Belly, becauſe they have taken on fat and fleſh abundantly without either encreaſing their Flanks, or augmenting their Belly.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe be ſtraitned in the Flanks, for not having his Ribs well enough turned, but ſo narrow compaſſed, that they furniſh no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> room ſufficient to lodge his Entrals eaſily within them, it is a conſiderable imperfection, and is known by the narrowneſs of the Flanks and ſtraitneſs of the Ribs which are next to them; yet if thoſe Horſes which are ſo, eat heartily their Hay and Oats, and drink well, they will prove as good as any for the Saddle, if they are not too fiery, but I would not meddle with them for a Coach; the moſt part of Horſes which have ſtrait turned Ribs, have good Chines or Backs, for a Man needs but conſider the Mules which have the ſtrongeſt and beſt ſhap't backs can be, and they have all of them their ſhort Ribs, or thoſe next to their Flanks ſtrait turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo all horſes which have their Reins very much elevate, have their Ribs likeways ſtrait turned 'tis true their croups are not beautiful, becauſe they are for the moſt part pointed, but then to ſupply that their Reins are excellent; ſuch Horſes are commonly called <hi>Sow-B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ck's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, although a Horſe be naturally light body'd, yet if his Ribs be well turned, and that he alſo eat as I have been telling, he will no doubt prove ſerviceable; eſpecially if his hind hand be large and well turned, and that he be not fiery: It is an infallible maxim, that a Man ſhould never buy a Horſe which is both light body'd and fiery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Horſes deſtroy themſelves in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe which hath no Flank have his Ribs too ſhort, then although you bring him to a good Belly, he will loſe it upon the caſt Travel or Fatigue; Ribs which are too ſhort are eaſily known by their not extending ſo much downwards as commonly they ought.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo carefully to conſider, if a Horſe which hath no Belly be fretful or fiery; for if he be, although he may have a good Appetite, yet he ſhall never become well Bally'd; I purpoſely repeat this becauſe it is of conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Now many people do ignorantly confound fireyneſs with vigour or high Mettle: Fireyneſs is an earneſt and immoderate deſire to go forwards, ſo that Horſes which are ſubject to it, Fret, Trample, Dance, and put themſelves all in a ſweet thorow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they have to Gallop, neither can they ſuffer any Horſe to go before them with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but fret and Torment themſelves until they have got before them again, in fine they are good for nothing but to fatigue the Rider, and weary themſelves to no purpoſe; young giddy headed people who have no experience, value their Horſes the more for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firey, and they ſay deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:179659:51"/>this Fieryneſs and troubleſome motion, but in being very ſenſible and fearing the ſpur, in being a little cold in his Actions, and not to have more of this forwardneſs than what his Rider intends he ſhould: In a word, a vigorous and true mettled Horſe, is one which is ſomewhat cold in his Actions, and very obedient to the Spurrs, that is, whoſe ſides are very ſenſible; yet this is not to ſay but Firey Horſes are many times very high Mettl'd, but their fault is in being ſo, with this fretful and firey diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have any great pain or weakneſs in their hind quarters, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light Belly'd, and experience diſcovers to us daily, that Horſes for only having in their hind-legs painful ſcratches will loſs their Bellies extreamly, and far rather than if they be any ways pained in their Hams by <hi>Spavins, Jardons,</hi> or <hi>Capelets,</hi> which are ſituate upon Nervous and ſenſible parts, and where by conſequence ſuch infirmities muſt cauſe an exceſſive pain; therefore when you are ſhown a Horſe which is light Belly'd, look immediatly to his Hams, and in all probability you will there find one of theſe three imperfections I juſt now mentioned, or at leaſt ſome other thing which paineth his hind quarters, that is, in ſome one or other of its parts; neither is this to ſay, that there are not ſometimes light body'd Horſes which have none of theſe infirmities in their Hams, but there is none which have any one of theſe above ſpecified imperfections, but what are light Belly'd; ſuch Horſes cannot endure Fatigue, ſo are not fit for the Saddle, and far leſs for the Coach: If the pain and weakneſs which is in the hind-quarter, and which is the occaſion of the Horſes being light Belly'd, proceed from a cauſe which may be in a ſhort time removed, it ſhould not ſtop your buying of the Horſe; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, painful ſcratches in the hind-legs will ſometimes take away a Horſes Belly, but then there is no great hazard, becauſe they may be eaſily cured; and ſo of ſeveral other Infirmities.</p>
                     <p>If the ſcratches are Nervous, that is, if they be ſituate upon the back ſinew of the Leg, a pretty way above the paſtern joint, in that caſe although people may endeavour to make you believe they are nothing, yet it is one of the moſt troubleſome external maladies to cure that a Horſe can have; I have known Horſes to have them ſix, eight, and ten Months, others to have become lame by them, and ſome at laſt to have dyed of them.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon beſides what I have given, why horſes which have ſuch infirmites in their Hams, become for the moſt part very light Belly'd, is, that the Hams or Jarrets are compoſed of Nerves, Ligaments, and Tendons, ſo that the leaſt ſtrange body which inſinuats it ſelf amongſt thoſe parts, will produce ſuch ſtrong effects, as will cauſe the Horſe not only to loſe his Belly and Flank, but alſo his Appetite; now ſeing the queſtion is here concerning the buying of Horſes, I ſay that every horſe which is light Belly'd, by reaſon of incurable infirmities in his Hams, ſhould be rejected as altogether uſeleſs, and by no means be bought let his rate be never ſo inconſiderable, and that not becauſe he is only light Belly'd, but becauſe that gauntneſs of his Belly is a token that he is much pained in his hams; there are however ſome horſes which have infirmities in their hams, and yet do not become light Body'd, as I have a hundred times ſeen one or two large Bone-ſpavins, in French <hi>Eſparvins de Bauf,</hi> not to cauſe the Horſes which had them to diminiſh in the leaſt in their Flanks, or become light Belly'd, but this was a ſign that either the horſes were not ſenſible, or that thoſe Spavins were not very painful; however I would take no horſes with ſuch ſpavins, which I ſhall diſcourſe of more at large in their proper place; I muſt alſo tell you, that there are ſome horſes which are leſs ſenſible of the effects of pain than others.</p>
                     <p>There is another imperfection, to which Horſes which are brought up in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces where they feed them with a great dale of Hay, and a very few Oats, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which is, that this method of feeding cauſeth their Bellies to become very big and take the Form and ſhape of a Cows Belly with Calf, which is a thing not only very unbecoming, but ſuch Horſes are likeways never ſo light and clever, nor well winded as they ought; Alſo when a Man would make a horſe Fat and Luſty which is very low, and that he let him eat abundance of Hay, without which he will have difficulty to make him very plump, in this caſe I ſay, the Horſe belly will be at firſt Swallowed up, or fall too low, and at laſt paſs to the Croup and inſenſibly diminiſh, for the moſt part of horſes never begin to take on fleſh, untill they become big and well belly'd; to prevent and remedy theſe bellys which incline to be thus ſwallowed up or fall too low, the Engliſh take a very good method, which is to make a good broad ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179659:51"/>inclines to fall too low, and thus continue it for a while, ſtraitning it a hole now and then by degrees, and by this means the big or low Belly is made to paſs ſooner towards the Croup, and ſo inſenſibly diminiſh; There are alſo ſome horſes which have very big bellys, but pointed and narrow hind quarters, to ſuch the uſe of theſe Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingles do very well; before I ſee the proof of this I had enough a do to believe it, but I am now convinced of it by my own experience, and therefore was willing to ſet it down in this place for the behoof of the Curious: Let us now return and diſcourſe of the flanks.</p>

                     <p>If he make a ſtring or cord in breathing, which is, when in the Act of reſpiration he attracts to him theskin of his Belly where the Ribs fail, ſo that he maketh as it were a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or groove all along them, then it is a token that his Flank beginneth to alter, or at leaſt a certain ſigne that the horſes Body is overheated, that he hath been ſick, or will in a ſhort time become ſo: This Cord or rather Hollow along the Ribs doth many times appear in Vigorous Horſes, which have been too undiſcreetly puſhed on or over Rid, it will alſo appear in Horſes which have made any extraordinary journeys, and then it will be a ſigne not of actuall purſyneſs, but only that in a ſhort time they may become ſo; But at leaſt, it is a token of a great inward heat occaſioned by the preceeding fatigue, and which will prove very difficult to extinguiſh, eſpecially if the Horſes are old.</p>
                     <p>Purſyneſs is a conſiderable enough imperfection in a Horſe to keep him from being bought; for if he be quit ſpent with it, it is eaſily known, yet at firſt a man may readily be deceived with it; therefore the cautions which a man ſhould make uſe of to prevent being impoſed upon by it, are theſe which follow: You are firſt then to obſerve the Horſes age, becauſe young Horſes are very rarely purſy; next to conſider if his Flank be not ſwallowed up, or faln too low, that is, if it deſcend too much over againſt that part of the thigh which is called the ſtiffle joint, you are then to defye or miſtruſt that Flank. This is the language of the Horſe-courſers, or thoſe who trade in Horſes; They ſay alſo there is a trouble in ſuch a Flank, to expreſs that the Flank is not freſh, but beginneth to become purſy; But to render your ſelf more certain, you muſt preſs his throple or wind-pipe near to the upper part of the nether jaw bones, or onſet of the head, that ſo you may make him cough, which is very eaſely done, and then take notice to the ſound of it; if it be dry it is nought, and if it be dry and often reiterate, it is yet worſe, if it be moiſt there is not ſo much hazard, but if he fart as he coughs, then it is almoſt always a ſign of purſyneſs; Yet to judge certainly if there be any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of purſyneſs, the ſureſt way is to conſider him in the Stable when he is performing no violent exerciſe, and if poſſible immediatly after he hath drunk, or when he is eating his Oats.</p>
                     <p>I am now giving directions to ſuch people as have no great experience, for when a Man is once become Skilfull, let the Horſe be either over heated, or only warm
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179659:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>with Riding, and he will know if he be purſy, as well if he were cold and ſtanding ſtill and quiet, but for ſuch as have not that experience, the ſureſt way is to obſerve him when cold, for when a Horse hath been galloping or traveling, or that he hath not drunk for a pretty while, a Man cannot judge ſo certainly of him; neither alſo when he is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now this wheezing and blowing imperfection, doth not proceed from any defect in the Lungs, or thoſe parts which depend upon them, but from the narrowneſs of the conduits of Reſpiration which end at the upper part of the Noſe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are other horſes again which are thick-winded and blow as they are working, but not ſo much as thoſe which wheeze, but however they puff and blow very much, and although their flanks do not redouble, as they do in a purſy horſe, to give them eaſe, yet they are not more moved nor diſordered by it than the abovementioned wheezers are, but neither the one nor other are agreeable, or for any great ſervice; in a word a thick wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horſe is he, which hath his breathing a little more free than a puffer or blower, but yet blows a great dale when he is exerciſed, ſo that neither of them ſhould be boug <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t at a dear rate; yet a man may be miſtaken in it becauſe when a horſe hath been kept a long time in the Stable without exerciſe, he will at firſt riding be out of wind, although he be neither a blower nor thick winded.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome wheezers or blowers, which rattle and make a noiſe thorow their Noſe, as if there were ſomething which ſtopt the paſſages of Reſpiration, but this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment goeth and cometh, and proceedeth only from abundance of phlegmatick ſtuff, which is no Symptom at all of the Horſes being Purſy; for his Flanks will no ways redouble neither will be have a Cough with it, and therefore cannot be Purſy, but only a Wheezer and Blower; people may ſee in the Riding Schools or Academys ſome of theſe kind of Horſes which ſerve, but then their price ſhould be moderate if a Man is to buy them.</p>

                     <p>In buying Coach Horſes, People are many times caught and deceived by it, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they doe not ſee them draw before they pay for them, for there are ſome of them that during the time they are a ſhowing, or making their parade, will trot unitely, with their ſhoulders free and eaſie, and having a good movement with their Legs will plant their feet right upon the ground, and keep their heads high and firm, and yet the very ſame Horſes being harneſſed and put to a Coach, will ſo ſoon as they have trotted a little puff or blow like Oxen, that is they are Wheezers or Blowers; a man can not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the Sellers of ſuch Horſes to take them again, becauſe they are not purſy; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before you pay for any Coach Horſes, ſee them firſt draw, not only to obſerve if they have this imperfection, but alſo to know if they draw truly and well: Every Horſe which is deſigned for a Coach, ſhould in drawing ſtoop with his hind parts and raiſe his fore, and then he will draw right, but if he raiſe his hind parts and ſtoop with his fore, then he will draw ill.</p>

                     <p>WHat remains to be examined,<note place="margin">CHAP: XVI A yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the faults and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, eſpecially in their Hind quatters.</note> is of no leſs importance than that which hath been already diſcourſed of, in ſo far as inconſiderable faults, do by degrees increaſe and augment, either thorow exceſſive labour or negligence; I ſhall therefore reſtrict my ſelf to trace them exactly in this Chapter, by diſcovering all the faults and imperfections to which the Hind quarters are moſt ſubject, becauſe, they are chief and eſſential parts relating to the goodneſs of a Horſe, and without the exact ſhapes of which, he can not be very ſerviceable; eſpecially ſeing People do many times obſerve good Horſes fail firſt in thoſe parts, particularly thoſe deſigned for hunting and the mannage, and therefore I think it belongs to one who is perfectly skilful, to know and underſtand them all to the very minuteſt and moſt inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>You are then firſt to caſt your eye upon his Croup or Buttocks, which ſhould be large, round, and neither pointed nor too long ſhapt; having the Tail placed or ſet pretty high, for thoſe which have the onſet of the tail very low, are commonly of no great ſtrength, and have their Croups pointed, and Buttocks too low.</p>
                     <p>In the next place lift up his Dock or Rump, to know if it be ſtiff and firm, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be not an infallible token of ſtrength and vigour, yet for the moſt part it is; Horſes which are vigorous keep their Docks cloſe and firm when they are pulled up; there are others again which carry their tails ſtraight out from them, or cock them as we ſay; theſe are all good marks: having lift up his tail, you muſt obſerve if his thighs be at a ſufficient diſtance from other, for it is ane imperfection and a token of weakneſs when they are too cloſs upon other; People know it when they perceive but a little diſtance betwixt them, and that they preſs or come extraordinary cloſs upon one another.</p>
                     <p>If the thighs be diſcharged of Fleſh and lean, it is a conſiderable imperfection let the Horſe be never ſo Plump and luſty otherwiſe; it is unpleaſant and chokes the ſight, and People many times find a croup which is large and well turned, which becomes nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in ane inſtant towards the thighs or Gaſcorns, for lack of Fleſh in that part, which is a token of weakneſs in the hind quarters; ſuch Horſes are ſaid to be ill ſpread in the Gaſcoyns; Horſes which have a ſudden twitch with any of their hind legs, that is, which have the Dry-ſpavin, are very ſubject to this imperfection, for the Muſcle of the thigh which ſhould be alwayes very full and large in that part, hath no bigneſs, this muſcle is ſituate upon the fore part of the thigh, and the back part of the thigh over againſt it is ſomewhat thin and trenchant, whereas it ſhould be very large and full: Thighs which are full and well charged with Fleſh, and ſhoulders which are ſmall and have little Fleſh upon them, are alwiſethe beſt.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo to obſerve if the Horſe be bowed in his hind legs or have them arched inwards; for although ſuch bow legged horſes be many times good, yet it is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient enough imperfection in Mountainous Countreys, becauſe that in the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents they ſtrike and rub their hams againſt one another; and beſides, they have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a weak hind hand, for as a man with his knees joyn'd cannot raiſe from the ground

                        </gap>, as if he ſet his legs a little aſunder, ſo for the very ſame reaſon is it that a horſe which hath his hind legs bowed or arched, hath them alſo a little more weak then otherwayes he would.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome horſes of mannage which are a little narrow and ſtrait in their hams, and yet go very well, but they would yet go better if they had not that imperfection.</p>
                     <p>The Horſe Courſers to deſcribe a horſe which is bowed or Arched inwards in his hind Legs, ſay that he is cloſed behind, imagining by the ſmoothneſs of the expreſſion to diminiſh the imperfection; Horſes of mannage which are thus very much bowed, can perform no beautiful action upon their haunches, for their whole mannage is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant not only to thoſe who behold them, but alſo to themſelves by reaſon of the difficulty they find in performing it.</p>
                     <p>It is very eaſie to perceive and underſtand this imperfection, becauſe the hams are nearer to other than the feet, eſpecially the points of the Hams called the Hocks, and the diſtance enlarges ſtill towards the Feet, as it doeth in theſe men which are called Baker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd, or which have them after the form of a renverſed Y.</p>
                     <p>You are afterwards to conſider the hams, and to look upon them as the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant parts, in which no ſmall and inconſiderable faults can be found, and to which few people take great notice, becauſe they can ſcarcely be convinced that ſuch imperfections are really to be found in them; for every one eaſily flatters himſelf in his own intereſt and perſwades himſelf that the imperfection which People ſhow him, does only conſiſt in the imagination of him who pretends to diſcover it; I had almoſt forgot to tell you in this place, although I have hinted a little at it elſe where, that there is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the hind Legs which is juſt contrary to what I have been mentioning, becauſe in walking or riding the horſe carrieth them outwards, ſo that inſtead of being bowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There cometh upon the back-ſide of the Ham, below the Capelet, and a little inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the inſide, a ſwelling which is called the <hi>Curb,</hi> and is more to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than a Veſſigon, for it maketh the horſe frequently to halt, and keepeth the whole Leg ſtiff, becauſe the ply and bending of the Ham is troubled with it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its motion interrupted, or at leaſt performed with difficulty and pain; this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is incurable, and therefore the fire muſt be applyed to it in place of all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, whoever deſires to ſee more at large what a <hi>Curb</hi> and <hi>Veſſigon</hi> are, may have recourſe to the 102. and 107 Chapters of the ſecond part, where they will find the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions and cauſes of theſe infirmities deſcribed to the full: Thoſe who are ignorant do not the leſs eſteem horſes which have <hi>Curbs,</hi> and thoſe who pretend without a great experience to give account of all the imperfections belonging to the Hams, do indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently call them all <hi>Curbs;</hi> a Curb is very troubleſome in ſo far as the fire doth not much reſolve and reſtrict it, and therefore people commonly ſay that Curbs ſcorn and mock at firing, as indeed it is true, for I have alwayes obſerved but a very ſmall amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dment in Curbs, notwithſtanding of the application of it; indeed they did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grow any larger, but then their diminution was alſo very inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Upon the inſide of the Ham a little diſtant from the Curb, but about the ſame height, there is a bone which ſtandeth ſomewhat high and elevate; all Hams have it, but in ſome it is more elevate than in others, and it is natural in all horſes; that part of the Ham which is below that bone ſwelleth by a degorging of the great vein, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in that part, and formeth a ſoft ſwelling juſt as it doth in Men, which is called a <hi>Variſſe,</hi> this dilated vein or <hi>Variſſe</hi> does not make a horſe halt, but only ſometimes ſpoils his ſale, by growing exceſſively large; in ſome it diminiſheth, but the ſwelling is always ſoft; A Man may be eaſily impoſed upon by this Infirmity, for eaſe and reſt (eſpecially if the part be daily bathed with good ſpirit of Wine will ſo reſtrict it, that I give full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the moſt nice and quick ſighted to diſcover, if they can, any thing like ſuch a ſwelling for the time.</p>
                     <p>Below the <hi>Curb</hi> and <hi>Variſſe,</hi> but more upon the inſide, and upon the upper part of the inſtep, beneath the bending of the Ham, do the Spavins come which are marked 31 in in the figure of the firſt plate, and are very troubleſome Infirmities, which doe commonly at laſt lame the Horſe; they are of two kinds, to wit the Dry, and Ox-Spavin; the Ox-Spavin is a callous and griſſly ſwelling hard as a bone and which is ſo painful that it maketh the Horſe looſe his Belly; it is known by its bigneſs upon the inſide of the upper part of the inſtep, and that bigneſs or ſwelling when once hardned is about the bigneſs of ones Thumb, and frequently cauſeth the horſe halt, and as I have already, ſaid the great pain which this Spavin occaſions, dryeth up the Horſe and maketh him looſe his Flanks; and although he may be recovered by reſt, yet with one or two days travel he will become ſo lank and thin that you may draw him thorow a needle, having his Belly as light as a Grey-hounds; it is certain that every horſe which hath one or two Ox-Spavins, will be very little ſerviceable for any imployment he can be put to, and eſpecially if the Spavin beſides its bigneſs be alſo ſo very painful, that it make him halt as he trots; there are ſome horſes which only halt with them at their firſt coming out of the Stable, when they are but newly ſeiſed with them, and that the Spavins are but young: It is called the Ox-Spavin, becauſe old Oxen are commonly ſubject to it, and have it extreamly big, but whereas they do them no prejudice, they for the moſt part always Criple and Lame a Horſe; I have ſeen horſes which have had both large and ſmall Ox-Spavins, and yet did not loſe their Flanks with them, but trotted very equally, which was a certain token that they gave them very little trouble and pain, and theſe horſes were ſold at the ſame rates as if they had wanted theſe Spavins, becauſe no body obſerved them, for when they were handled they felt as hard as the bone; however I would adviſe no man to venture upon ſuch, becauſe ſoon or late they will certainly do their Maſters a bad office; yet many half skill'd people are of another opinion, and ſay that ſuch ſwellings are not Spavins, but the real bones of the Legs which grow larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and biger in ſome horſes than in others, now every man hath his own ſentiment, and mine after the great care and experience I have had of it, is that it is a moſt conſiderable imperfection; when Ox-Spavins do firſt ſeiſe upon Horſes, they are the more difficult to be obſerved, in that they do not much riſe above the ſubſtance of the Legs, but yet at their firſt pearcing they commonly make alwayes a horſe halt, and afterwards the ſwelling growing bigger, the horſe halteth no more with it; but ſeeing they very rarely come equally in both the Hams, the one Ham is eaſily perceived to be bigger then the other, which immediatly diſcovers the imperfection, and which the perſon who is conſidering the horſe, will far better obſerve being placed before the horſe and a little towards one

                     <p>The ſecond kind is the Dry-Spavin, which is perceived by the moſt unskilful, for when a Horſe in walking raiſeth with a twitch or ſudden motion one of his hind-legs high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other, he is then ſaid to have this kind of Spavin, and will have it many times in both hind-legs: Horſes which have this imperfection, make this ſuden motion or twitch with their Legs but from timeto time, and not alwiſe, but only when they come fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> out of the Stable, and before their Legs be a little ſuppled with walking; alſo when ſuch horſes are made to ſtand ſtill a little in the fields, they will give ſudden twitches with their leg for the firſt three or four ſteps they make, but if they were rid in a mannage, they would always halt or twitch with their Legs ſo long as they are rid, becauſe of their being kept upon their Haunches.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this ſudden draught which Horſes make by twitching up their leg, proceeds from their not having the motion of their Hams free and eaſie, and therefore are conſtrained to perform it with either their thigh or haunch, which is the cauſe of the motion being ſo violent and precipitant.</p>
                     <p>This imperfection of the Dry-Spavin is not ſo much to be apprehended as the other, but if the horſe's hind quarters be narrow, in plain Engliſh, if his Hams be bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inwards and crooked, and that he be ſubject to dry ſpavins.

                     <p>Dry-ſpavins are an impediment to ſwiftneſs, and for this one reaſon Horſes which have them are not much eſteemed for the wars, becauſe ſeeing they halt in running, they loſe that time they take in halting or twiching up their legs, and ſo cannot imploy it in running: Dry-ſpavins do frequently degenerat into Ox-ſpavins, ſo that ſuch Horſes have two different infirmities of one name, altho' varying in their natures, they are eaſily diſcovered and will infallibly Lame the Horſe, you are therefore not to delay, but to apply the fire to them as ſoon as poſſible, becauſeinfirmity thus upon infirmity, is a token of no good habite or conſtitution of body, beſides that firing does not always cure them.</p>
                     <p>If upon the out ſide of the Ham below the Veſſigon, there be a Swelling more than ordinary, and hard as a Spavin, only that it is upon the inſide and this upon the out, and that this alſo mounteth almoſt as high as the part where the Veſſigon cometh, whereas the Spavin upon the inſide doth notaſcend ſo high; it is called a <hi>jardon</hi> or <hi>jarde,</hi> and is an imperfection as much if not more to be feared then the Spavin; few people obſerve and conſider it, although it be as painfull as the ſpavin, and alſo maketh the Horſe light Belly'd, by keeping his Ham ſtiff, and making him always halt, at leaſt when he is any ways fatigued; this is alſo an imperfection with which I would not buy a Horſe; but as there are few horſes which have it, and that it is an imperfection not very common, therefore few people know and underſtand it: It is hard as a bone and lameth always the Horſe, neither is their any remedy for it but firing, which doth not always ſucceed, eſpecially when the Horſe hath had it any conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>People know this imperfection, by only obſerving the extraordinary ſwelling we have mentioned, particularly upon the number 32. Marked in the figure of the firſt plate,</p>

                     <p>If upon the fore-ſinew of the leg, between the ſpavin upon the inſide and the jardon without, there be as it were a circle which joineth them, and invironeth the nerve of the inſtep, then is it a conſiderable imperfection to which few horſes are Subject, but when they have it they are incurable; I never ſee above halfe a dozen have it, and they had all of them acquired it by being kept too much upon their haunches, neither did I ever obſerve a horſe to have this circle, but he had always either a jardon or ſpavin accompanying it, but I have many times ſeen ſpavins and jardons alone without it: Now a horſe which hath this infirmity is ſpoilt and ruined paſt recovery.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo to obſerve if the ply or bending of the Ham be ſwelled, which would be a conſiderable imperfection, eſpecially in a Coach Horſe; for it is a ſource, which maketh a continuall diſcharge of humours upon the legs, that cauſe putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and breed mattering warts, in French <hi>Petreaux,</hi> and other infirmities in thoſe parts, to which Coach Horſes are but too ſubject, and therefore ſuch a ſwelling ſhould alone hinder a Man to buy a Coach Horſe which hath it, but if the whole Ham be ſwelled, then ſeeing it may proceed from ſome accident, as Caſting with the Halter, being intangled with the croſs hanging barr, or ſuch like, which may all be cured, in this caſe there is not much to be feared, and therefore the Seller ſhould warrant the recovery of the Horſe, or otherways oblige himſelfe to take him again, becauſe I have more than once ſeen ſuch kind of ſwellings to ſtand in need of firing to diſcuſs them, although they were only light ſized and ſaddle Horſes which had them.</p>
                     <p>In the ply of the Ham where this ſwelling cometh, there are ſome times Chops and Crevices which reſemble the Mallender in the fore-legs, and are called the Selender, it will be ſo much the better if they are there when the ſwelling is alſo in that part, becauſe they will ſerve as drains, thorow which the humor occaſioning the ſwelling will evacuate it ſelfe, but then it were yet better that that humour were not at all there, becauſe then their would be no need of a Selender to drain it,</p>
                     <p>Beſides the reaſons I have already given, to convince you that there is no part of a Horſes body ſhould be more narrowly conſidered than the Hams; you are alſo to obſerve that they are thoſe parts which carry and ſupport the greateſt weight of the body, when a Horſe is performing any beautifull ayre in the mannage, or galloping at hunting, ſo that if he have already any weakneſs in them, it will but add more blemiſhes to his infirmity, if he be continued at thoſe exerciſes, and if people require any more of him than to goe at a foot place, feeling the trouble he hath in his Hams, and not being able to move them without pain, he will endeavour to eaſe himſelfe, by reſting as much as he can upon his fore-legs to ſpare them behind, ſo that theſe before will be very ſoon ſpoilt, and the Horſe become abſolutely uſeleſs, having neither fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs nor Hams he can make uſe of; beſides that going always thus upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, becauſe of the pain he hath in his Hams, he will become at laſt a perfect Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage horſe, or at leaſt very unpleaſant and uneaſie for the Saddle, which we call a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full jade of attendance, of whom, the beſt is to make ones ſelfe Rid with the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſeeing he is for no kind of ſervice, and that the longer he be keept he will ſtill become the greater Carrion.</p>
                     <p>It is an infallible rule upon which a man may rely when he is a buying a horſe, that when one of the hands or quarterts of a horſe is weaker than the other, he will ſoon be ſpoilt and ſerve but a very ſhort time, when I ſay hands or quarters, I mean either his two hind legs or his two fore, and this weakneſs cometh more frequently in the fore-legs than hind; a good token whereby to know if the fore hand be weak, is when the horſe hath little or no movement in his fore-legs, and that when he is puſhed on in a Carrier, he formeth his halts or ſtops well upon his haunches, which is a ſign that his hind quarter is ſtrong and that he hath good reins, but that his fore are weak; to know if that weakneſs in the fore legs be natural or accidental, is what is very difficult to determine, but for a half-skilled perſon, it is abundantly ſufficient that he knows the imperfection, without penetrating into its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſes weakneſs proceed from his hind quarters, then in all probability he will be either bowed, or which is quite contrary to it, carry his Hams outwards as he is riding, or otherways will have ſome conſiderable infirmities in them, as ſpavins, Curbs, jardons, &amp;c. and if it be in his fore hand, then his legs will be ſpoilt by being round and gourded, having the nerves hard and a little contracted, with ſplints, windgalls, and other ſuch like infirmities.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:179659:56"/>
                     <p>Morover if he have only one of his legs weak, then the other three by carrying and ſupporting always the whole weight of his body, will ſoon come to be ſpoilt; and if one of his Quarters be weak, for example his fore hand, then the hind will but endure a ſhort time, becauſe it will ſupport his whole weight, and therefore in a little it will be as ſoon ſpoilt as that before, except he be a horſe of mannage, which with a weak fore-hand, eſpecially if his hind quarter be excellent, may indeed endure and ſerve a conſiderable time, providing alſo that the ayre which it is intended he ſhall always goe, be appropriate to the foibleneſs of the horſe, or goodneſs and ſtrength of his hind hand, but his fore parts then will have no movement, becauſe he will goe very low and cloſs by the ground, and although he may be very much upon his haunches, yet he will appear to goe upon his ſhoulders, becauſe of his not plying and bending enough his fore-legs: If both the Horſes quarters be equal in ſuppleneſs, ſtrength, and goodneſs, then is it a token that he will be long ſerviceable and uſefull.</p>
                     <p>When Horſes are appointed for the mannage, it is very imprudently done to take them with the leaſt imperfection or infirmity in their Hams; for what good can be expected from a horſe which cannot be put exactly upon his haunches, for fear of preſently ſpoiling him, by augmenting the imperfection, which he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

At <hi>Paris</hi> the Coach-horſes of a moiſt temper and conſtitution, and loaded with humours, are very much ſubject to it, becauſe the ſharp and picquant ſalt, of the Dirt and Mudof the ſtreets, doth very much contribute to it, eſpecially if the Coach men are careleſs in keeping their Legs clean.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179659:57"/>thickneſs of ones finger, and ſometimes alſo about the thickneſs of ones Thumb, throw out filthy ſtinking ſtuff, ſpoil the Leg inſenſibly, and enlarge becauſe of the great number there is of them; after a Leg is once infeſted with them, they are very troubleſome to cure, becauſe they have roots which are imperceptible, and which draw their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Nerves, ſo that after you have dryed up, and even conſumed all that appears, as well by Cauſticks as firing, yet thoſe roots which atract and feed upon that Nervous juice make them to revive again: The <hi>Poireaux</hi> or mattering warts which come in the paſterns, are hid beneath the long hair of the Fetlocks; there are ſome of them ſo very maligne, that they make the hair fall all around them, and they themſelves grow up like Walnuts; there are others again which are more flat, and not ſo much raiſed above the skin, but they are more dangerous than thoſe which are bigeſt and moſt elevate; this infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is eaſily diſcovered when a Man is a buying a Horſe, for he will perceive a great many mattering kind of Warts or <hi>Poireaux</hi> which touch one another, and are without hair; they are for the moſt part humid and ſend forth matter, but yet may be dryed up for a ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>There cometh ſometimes alſo in the ſoles mattering kind of warts, or rather Figs, upon the fruſh, which are eaſy to be known, for they are in a manner detatched from it, and ſend forth a ſtinking kind of matter, they alſo appear diſtinctly upon the middle of the fruſh towards the heel, which is full of corrupt ſtuff, they commonly exceed the ordinary height of the fruſh, and are as I ſaid rather figs than <hi>Poireaux</hi> or mattering warts, although they are for the moſt part called <hi>Poireaux,</hi> becauſe of their being mentained and nouriſhed by the ſame nervous juice as they.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Figs grow ſometimes alſo upon the ſides of the fruſh, and beneath the ſole of the foot, and when they are conſiderably raiſed above the fruſh, ſo that they touch the ground as the Horſe is riding, they then cauſe him halt to the very ground.</p>
                     <p>The external form of Figs, is the the ſame with thoſe <hi>Poireaux</hi> or mattering warts which come in the paſterns, only that the figs do not in the beginning ſend forth ſuch ſtinking matter as the <hi>Poireaux</hi> or Leek heads doe; thoſe figs are of ſuch conſequence that no man ſhould buy a Horſe which hath them, becauſe their cure is long and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſo that ſuch perſons who know the ſecret of it, may ſafely ſay they can perform what very few people can, although ſome within this ſhort time have become pretty skilful in it.</p>
                     <p>A Man may know when a Horſe hath been cured of figs, eſpecially if he hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long under them, becauſe that foot in which he had them will be larger than the reſt, and will ſtill continue to be ſo, although the Horſe be otherways very well recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and render good ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I know a fine Coach Horſe whom there was a neceſſity to reject, becauſe they had neglected to look to the figs which he had in his hind ſoles, which were become ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that the little foot or Coffin-bone was almoſt quite diſcovered by it, ſo that one might have eaſily touched it with the prob, thorow the corruption which the figs had made a top of it; the Horſe being in this condition did rid but with trouble, and his hind feet were almoſt twice as big as his fore, ſo that at laſt there was a neceſſity to reject him.</p>
                     <p>There cometh ſometimes alſo thorow a Horſes whole Body, a great number of figs or rather <hi>Anburys,</hi> but which do no kind of prejudice, and as their roots are a great dale leſs than their bodies, people tye a threed of double ſilk about them, which they ſtraiten by degrees, and which maketh theſe <hi>Auburys</hi> to dry up and fall away, eſpecially if they are begun to be tyed and reſtricted after the full of the Moon, and when ſhe is a decreaſing, and that they be daily anointed with the juice of the herb purſlain, or with the milk which cometh from green figs when they are broke and ſqueezed; there are few of theſe kind of Figs or <hi>Anburys</hi> which are not eradicat in the decreaſe of one Moon, but the ſilk threed muſt be ſtraitned once in three days: ſometimes they go away of their own accord, and ſo the horſe is freed of them, unleſs it be a certain kind of large ones, which are broad at the roots, and alſo almoſt asflat as a Crown piece, ſuch immediatly appear upon the ſurface of the skin, the part is quick, and ſendeth forth a ſtincking juice or water, if theſe kind of <hi>Anburys</hi> be neglected, they will increaſe to the bigneſs of half Oranges, and will be very ugly, they may be dryed up with the yellow water, by touching them with it once or twice a day, and if you ſtrew them over with the powder of dryed Cuttle fiſh bone, and continue it, you will ſo kill them that they will no more appear: they come likeways upon that part of the neck where blood is taken, and which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed by ſtricking with a ruſty lance or fleam, alſo in the flat and middle parts of hind Legs: The beſt remedy which I find for either, is the yellow water, or vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary water, deſcribed in the 60. <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 8. and 61. <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 3d. of the

In fine, although it is not in this place you ſhould find remedies, I have however thought fit to ſet down this becauſe of its eaſineſs, and that it is not worth the while to make a Chapter expreſly for it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Traverſe Mules</hi> or Kib'd heels, are Chops and Clifts which ſurround the back parts of the paſtern joints where they ply and bend, and oft-times there cometh above that part many more; this infirmity is more painfull than the preceeding, becauſe theſe chincks as a horle is Riding, ſhut and open by reaſon of the motion made by the paſtern-joint, which maketh them very painfull; it is with difficulty that they can be dryed up, becauſe of that movement that keepeth them ſtill open, and which augmenteth the deſcent of the humour that nouriſheth them; thoſe who underſtand not this infirmity call it a Creviſſe, it is indeed a Creviſſe, but which is more propperly called a <hi>Traverſe Mule</hi> or Kib'd Heel.</p>
                     <p>This infirmity ſhould not hinder a man to buy a horſe if the legs be not gorged and ſwelled, although the moſt inconſiderable infirmities in Coach-Horſes legs, are truly very much to be feared becauſe of their bad conſequences; oftentimes this infirmity maketh a Horſe always halt, until the ſharpneſs of the humour, heat, and ſwelling of the leg are removed.</p>
                     <p>Beſides <hi>Rats-Tails, Poireaux</hi> or mattering warts, and <hi>Traverſe mules,</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the hind legs a kind of white, ſharp, and corrupt humour or <hi>Waters,</hi> called in French <hi>Manvaiſes Eaux,</hi> they come very rarely in the fore-legs, but rather almoſt always in the hind, theſe <hi>Waters</hi> are like to a ſtinking kind of matter, which paſſing thorow the pores of the skin deaden it, and alſo render it of a whitiſh collour, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do not ulcerate, but in the Creviſſes which are either in the paſtern or upon the paſtern-joint: This infirmity is quickly known by cauſing lift the hind feet, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſterns, in which you will preſently find a humidity and moiſtneſs beneath the hair, which is extremely ſtinking, and groweth all round the paſtern and paſtern-joint, and ſometimes up almoſt to the very Ham; you are to obſerve that people dry up theſe humours or <hi>Waters</hi> for a certain time, but then thy return again; It is eaſie to know when they have been dried up, becauſe you will find the filth and neaſtineſs in the paſterns, which is occaſioned by the Drugs that were made uſe of to dry and heal them up.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mauvaiſes Eaux</hi> or this white corrupt and ſharp humour, is not of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the beginning, becauſe its courſe is eaſily put a ſtop to; they many times cauſe the paſterns and paſtern-joints to ſwell, keep the legs ſtiff, make the Horſe lean, and alſo ſeperate the fleſh from the Coronet near to the heels; all the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties almoſt of the legs, have their riſe and begining from theſe corrupt humours or waters, ſo that they are the cauſe of <hi>Poireaux</hi> or mattering kind of warts, <hi>Rats Tails, Arreſtes, Traverſing mules</hi> or Kib'd heels, and other ſuch like infirmities which make the horſe to periſh by his legs: After that the ſwelling of theſe hath continued a long time upon the legs, people are deceived when they imagine to diſcuſs it, for theſe infirmities do not eaſily yeeld to remedies, becauſe the humour occaſioning them is too much hardned and congealed; Therefore in ſuch an uncertainty, when a man knows not whether the infirmity be newly come or not, I am of opinion that no man ſhould buy Coach horſes, with gorged and ſwelled legs, unleſs they may be had at a very reaſonable rate.</p>
                     <p>However I would not ſcruple to buy a young horſe, although he might have ſome of theſe humours or <hi>Waters</hi> in his paſterns, providing that his Hams be dry, together with the bending of them, as alſo that his legs be not gorged, that is, ſwelled: The Horſe Courſers are not ſo groſs and fooliſh, as to put horſes to ſale which have ſuch <hi>Waters</hi> in their legs, for they dry them up from Evening to Morning when the horſes have no ſwelling with them, but if the legs are gorged, whatever they may pretend for an excuſe, you muſt not meddle with them, for they are ſufficiently hindred to reſtrict them by their not ſtirring out of the Stable, and eſpecially if the horſes do not incline to ly down and reſt.</p>
                     <p>The infirmities in the hind-legs are moſt dangerous for Coach horſes, eſpecially ſuch as have a great dale of hair upon their legs, becauſe being always wrought in Towns, where the dirt and mud is full of <hi>Nitre</hi> or a ſharp ſalt, unleſs they be carefully

                     <p>The Horſe-Marchants are obliged to warrant and ſecure the horſes they ſell, from theſe infirmities following, to wit Purſyneſs, Glanders, that he ſhall prove ſound when either warm or cold, that is, that he ſhall no more halt after he is warm, than he did at firſt going out of the ſtable when cold: If a horſe have any of theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, people both at <hi>Paris</hi> and almoſt over all France, oblige the ſeller to take him again within nine dayes after the delivery.</p>
                     <p>For the other infirmities, which I have been all along explaining in the preceeding Chapters, you are to have your eyes as ſharp and clear ſighted as poſſible, that ſo you may diſcover them, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Horſe-marchants, who are otherwayes generally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Horſe-courſers, are not obliged to warrant them, nay nor even the <hi>Eyes,</hi> for it is to be ſuppoſed that you might have looked to them and ſo have diſcovered whether they were good or not; but if you are a buying a horſe from a Gentleman or Burgeſs, who tells you expreſly that he will not warrant his ſoundneſs, you ſhould in that caſe uſe all diligence imaginable to diſcover the horſes infirmities, if you ſuſpect he have any, for when a horſes price is once payed, it is very difficult to make him be taken back again.</p>
                     <p>When a Man buyeth a Horſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> it is very fit to know the perſon from whom he is bought, leaſt he might have been ſtoln, becauſe it is lawful for the true owner of the Horſe, to take him again where ever he can find him, ſo that in this caſe the Buyer will be ſent to ſeek after the Seller he knoweth not where, and if he cannot find him, the price of the Horſe is loſt for good and all; it is juſt ſo when a Man buyeth a Horſe in the weekly Mercats, but if it be in an open and publick Fair there is no ſuch hazard.</p>
                     <p>You are yet further to obſerve, if the Horſe you intend to buy, be right ſituat, and planted upon his legs and feet, as he is ſtanding ſtill and quiet, and that he have the toes of his hind feet pointing ſtreight forwards and turned neither out nor in, or that he do not bring his hind legs too much forwardbeneath his belly as he is ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the very worſt of all ſtances: People ſay of ſuch a horſe, that his two ends, or head and Croup are going to join when they perceive him ſtanding in ſuch a poſture, and it is either a token of a bad horſe, or that he is much fatigued, when he thus endeavours to give eaſe to his fore-legs, by bringing forwards and as it were beneath his belly thoſe behind, that ſo he may make them ſupport the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weight of his body.</p>
                     <p>Having thus examined your horſe in every point as I have directed, you will, when once you have had a little practice, in the twinkling of an eye find out and diſcover the ſmalleſt imperfection, ſo that if a horſe have any, it will be the firſt thing will fall under your view and preſently diſpleaſe you; you are in the next place to conſider if he have a good Mouth.</p>

XVIII How to know if a Horſes Mouth be good and Loyal.</note> ſhould have a well raiſed Neck, and if it be ſomewhat large and thick, it ſhould be at leaſt well turned, his reins ſtrong and well ſhapt, and his legs and feet likewiſe; if he have all theſe right, no doubt but he will have (unleſs it be by accident) a very good Mouth; Look to, or rather feel between the upper parts of the jaw-bones, to know if they are ſufficiently well ſeperate, that ſo the Horſe may with the more eaſe bring in and place his head ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, for if theſe two bones be too cloſs upon other, and that he have alſo a ſhort and thick Neck charged with fleſh, ſo that he cannot place his Head right, his having a good mouth well be to little purpoſe, becauſe you cannot make uſe of it; and alſo this goodneſs of the Mouth is only agreeable, when the Head is brought in to its beſt ſituation and poſture; for we do not imitate the <hi>Cravates,</hi> who make their horſe carry their Noſes in the Air, by which they are very ſubject to falling; and alſo when any of them are in thir countryes, the Clods or Stones in the high-wayes make them frequently trip and ſtumble.</p>
                     <p>You have in the ſecond Chapter of this Firſt part, particular obſervations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know when a Horſes Mouth is good, to which I referr you that I may avoid repetitions: put your finger into the horſe's Mouth, preſſing his barr pretty hard with it, and if you find that it paineth him, it is a token that the barr is ſenſible, and conſequently that his Mouth is good, but upon the contrary, if the barr be not ſenſible his Mouth will be nought, for a horſes Mouth is no otherwiſe good, but it ſo far as it is leſs or more ſenſible; however too great a degree of it will render it bad, as I ſhall ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>Move your Finger alſo along his barrs, to feel if they be high and ridged, and not broke or hurt, which you will know either by the wound that is in them, or at leaſt the Cicatrice, and which kind of Barrs are almoſt as much to be apprehended as a bad mouth, for although the wound may come to heal up, yet the cicatrice or ſcarr where the wound was, will never have that ſenſe of feeling which the Barr would have were it free of it, and it is alſo probable, that that ſcar in the Barr may proceed from ſome cauſe which may denote the badneſs of the Mouth, or it may be occaſioned by the Riders having too rude a bridle hand, or by a bad Bit; the greateſt trouble which ariſes from ſuch large wounds in the Barrs, is that they penetrate to very bone, and corrupting it, cauſe ſmall ſplinters of bone to fall from it, where the Barr remaineth always after void and hollow, and which although it may be covered with the Cicatrice or healing up of the wound, yet will neither be ſo ſenſible as it was before, neither will the Mouth of the Bit reſt ſo equally upon it.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe if the place where the Curb reſteth be hurt, you may infer by it, that the horſe hath either a bad mouth, reſts too much upon the Bit in travelling, or that the Rider hath a hard hand, or otherwiſe that the Curb is ill made, ſuch as thoſe are which are either too ſmall in their Eſſes, or too ſquare and not very round; or laſtly, that the place where the Curb reſteth is very tender; but in buying a horſe a man ſhould always conclude the worſt againſt him, and believe that the place where the Curb reſteth hath been hurt, either by his having too hard a preſſure upon the Curb, or by his mouths not being ſo ſenſible as it ought.</p>
                     <p>In fine, to know with an intire certainty if a horſes mouth be good, you muſt les him part, or put him on pretty ſmartly, and then preſently ſtop him; by his parting you will know if he be not tickliſh mouth'd, that is, if he doe not chack the bridle or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179659:59"/>throw up his head, for when a horſe hath a too ſenſible or tickliſh mouth, he will rarely fail to beat upon the hand, or throw up his head, eſpecially at his firſt parting or breaking off; again by his ſtop you will find if he ſtoppeth eaſily, and by the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your hand, with his head firm and well placed.</p>
                     <p>You muſt make him thus part and ſtop very quickly two or three times, and if he perform it exactly, it will be a token not only of a good mouth, but alſo of much ſtrength and Vigour; For if his parting be quick, and his ſtops juſt, with a firm and ſteddy head it is an extraordinary good ſign, not only as to his mouth, but alſo as to his Reins: Becauſe after a violent action ſuch as that of running, in which a horſe fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his body, if he ſtop as quickly and ſhort as a man would have him, it is a certain token of a good mouth, which by its ſenſibility obliges the horſe to Aſſemble in an inſtant all his forces and ſtrength, that were extended and ſtretched in his courſe, to put himſelf upon his hinder parts or haunches; and if he repart again readily, and ſtop ſhort, a man may conclude from that, after he hath made him perform it twice or thrice, that the horſe hath a great dale of vigour, a good mouth, and excellent Reins: 'Tis indeed true, that if he be rid by a good horſeman, and that the Horſe himſelf be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo managed, or hath been but taught to form good and juſt ſtops according to his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, that in that caſe his rider may ſo order it, that he may with more eaſe perform what I have been ſaying; but if he part, and ſtop firm and ſhort twice or thrice, under an ordinary horſeman, I think that a man may very juſtly ſay that ſuch a horſe hath both mettle, ſtrength, and a good mouth, becauſe he parted quickly, formed very ſhort and bard ſtops, by an eaſie and gentle motion of the hand, without any kind of violence whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Now you are to obſerve if you pleaſe, that the ſhorteſt ſtops are not the beſt, but upon the contrary the very worſt and moſt dangerous, ſo tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> if you do not make uſe of them both very moderatly and ſeldom, you will ſoon ruine your Horſes hams, and diſorder his mouth; there needs no more to ſpoil a horſe but one bad and irregular ſtop, which may give him ſuch a ſtrain, as ſhall make him of leſs value for it all his life time; but when People buy a horſe they doe with him as they do with Fire Arms, to which they give a greater charge for the firſt or proof ſhot, than they will ever give them thereafter, and ſo men make uſe of this method of ſtopping horſes ſhort, for a tryal, which is both of very bad conſequence, and falſe when made uſe of upon any other occaſion: Beſides what I have already ſaid of the mouth, it ſhould be alſo full of froath, which will be if the horſe have what we call the action of the mouth, that is, if he champ continually upon the mouth of his bit, and play as it were with it, which is a token of a good horſe, for few bad ones have this action; a man needs not be very knowing in horſes, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand if the mouth be good, he is only to obſerve, if the horſe ſtop readily and eaſily after a quick and ſwift carrier, but let this be only underſtood of ſuch horſes as are deſigned for ordinary journey riding.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which have not a freſh and foaming mouth, may readily not have a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſtitution of body, but have a hot and dry Liver, which conſumes that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which by the agitation of the tongue is converted into froath.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo obſerve if this froath be thin and fluid, or of a pale, gray, or yellowiſh colour, all which denote a bad tempered Brain, but if it be white and thick, and cleave to his lips and branches of the bridle, then you are to look upon the mouth to be Freſh, and that the horſe is of a good conſtitution and ſound in his body: This laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a froathing mouth, and its different colours, will not pleaſe all people, and if they doe not look upon it as a bad remark, they will at leaſt think it an unneceſſary one, but as I have undertaken to omit nothing which relates to horſes, ſo I intreat the Reader to receive the advices I give him, with the ſame ſincerity of mind wherewith I offer them.</p>
                     <p>You may in the laſt place take notice, if the bit which the horſe hath in his mouth be not ſo rude, as by its violent effects to oblige and force him, to form his ſtops thus quick and ſhort, which is however not very eaſily concealed; for with ſuch a rude and harſh Bit a horſe will alwayes make grimaces, beat on the hand, open his mouth, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to force the hand of the rider; and if he do them not, he will have his mouth bloody, hurt, or very much galled, which will be an infallible token of either a bad mouth, too rude a Bit, or a very unskilful horſeman, and perhaps of all three.</p>

                     <p>You are not to treat after this faſhion Horſes which have a great dale of ſtrength and chine, or ſuch as are very delicate, becauſe with the leaſt action that the Rider maketh as if he graſp hard with the Brans of his Legs, they will perform ſome vigorous action as preſſing to go forwards, or leaping in one place, and if they find but in the leaſt the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179659:60"/>Spurrs, they will redouble their Leaps either in one place, or by preſſing forwards yerk out two or three times, to advertiſe the Rider to cloſe his Thighs and ſit firm; but as theſe kind of Horſes are not every Mans Merchandice, as thoſe who ſell them do very well know by the rate they put upon them, I ſhall diſcourſe no more of them, it not being very proper to preſcribe directions for the knowing of Horſes, to ſuch perſons as daily dreſs and manage them, and who conſequently ſhould underſtand them to the very bottom.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome jades which have no other defence when the ſpurrs are applyed to them, but to ſtrike out continually; a good honeſt Burgeſs or Citizen who were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by ſuch outſtriking, would ſay that ſuch a horſe hath a great dale of ſtrength, and that he would be very propper to make a Leaper for the manage; but in place of a better obſervation, I maintain, that the moſt part of horſes which ſtrike thus furiouſly out, doe diſcover their doggedneſs and ill nature, hoping thereby to free themſelves from labour and exerciſe; for every horſe which doeth nothing but ſtrike out, hath more ill nature in him than ſtrength, and a horſeman who ſuffereth a horſe thus to ſtrike out beneath him, may be a knowing Gentleman, which is what we call a learned Clerk, but upon my word he is no good horſeman, becauſe it is always the Riders fault, if he ſuffer a horſe to ſtrike out beneath him oftner then once or twice; thoſe who are skilful horſemen know if what I write ben't true.</p>
                     <p>There are other horſes again, which when a man gives them the ſpurrs, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them nor go forwards, but as it were cleaving and faſtening to them, ſtrike cut and goe back, and cauſe themſelves be beaten becauſe they will not advance, and if you preſs them hard, they will then fall a piſſing and not ſtir out of the place, theſe are called in French <hi>Chevaux Ramingues,</hi> or horſes which kick againſt the Spurrs; if he be a Gelding he will with difficulty quit this humour, and out of meer hopes to recover him, I would not buy him; when Geldings have once contracted a vice they very rarely quit with it again, eſpecially after they have had it a conſiderable time, and that it is become habitual; but if he be a Ston'd horſe, he may then perhaps forget it for a time, if he be under the conduct of a good horſeman, but if once he hath got the maſtery over any of his Riders, he will then be juſt to begin a new again, ſuch horſes are called <hi>Ramin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> or Kickers againſt the Spurrs which reſiſt, and as it were cleave to them, whereas a good horſe ſhould always fly the heels or ſpurrs: This is not to ſay, but Geldings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though guilty of any other vice but this of Kicking againſt the ſpurrs, may be very eaſily reduced, eſpecially if they be not a long time accuſtomed to it and that they alſo be under the conduct of a good Rider: But if they be mounted by ſome Booby or ſilly Fellow, they will become ſoon worſe than formerly; in a word every Gelding, Ston'd Horſe, or Mare, which does not fly the ſpurrs, but obſtinatly cleaves to and kicks againſt them, ſhould not be received, but lookt upon as horſes of a Croſs and Dogg'd Nature; and which are altogether uncapable to ſerve agreeably.</p>
                     <p>When you mount a horſe to try him, if he will not obey, but endeavours to goe where he himſelf hath a mind for it, and alſo makes uſe of all poſſible means to reſiſt you, you are then to reject him, as a reſty jade ought always to be, for a man ſhould buy horſes which have no other Will ſave that of their Rider; but then you muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found kicking againſt the ſpurrs, with this vice of Reſtineſs; for a horſe which kicketh againſt the ſpurrs in French <hi>Cheval Ramingue,</hi> is he which cleaveth to and reſiſts them, and inſtead of flying them or advancing, ſtandeth ſtill, leaps, ſtrikes out, or goeth back, and doeth all he can to diſobey you; theſe kind of horſes never quit altogether this vice: Again a reſty horſe endeavours to go where he will and when he will, by reſiſting his Rider with all the obſtinacy he is capable of, that ſo he may diſobey him; ſuch kind of Cattle are not at all to be meddled with.</p>
                     <p>In fine not to weaty the reader too much, I think the ſureſt method is, to chooſe, when a man can do it, ſuch horſes as are very apprehenſive of ſtroaks, and are afraid of the leaſt appearance of them, which at the only cloſing or graſping with the legs or rather thighs, are afraid and allarum'd, and that without fretting or fierineſs, that is, that they diſcover no more of their mettle and vigour, than what is required of them; it is with theſe qualifications that I ſeek them, after I find they have a good mouth, and I believe all people will be of my opinion; a horſe which is free of any conſiderable fault, which walks deliberatly and ſecurely, without needing too often the whip, and which without fretting goes from the walk to the gallop, and from the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop to the ſtep again, without being diſquieted, but alwayes champing upon his bit, which Trots with a glibneſs in his ſhoulders, and gallops eaſily, ſnorting a little thorow his Noſtrils, if he gallops eaſily, he will certainly gallop a long time and with pleaſure, becauſe of his having a good wind; if he be well upon his haunches, and gives a token of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179659:61"/>his being ſtrong and nervous, having a ſwift and juſt Carrier, a light and eaſie ſtop, his head firm and well placed, and the <hi>Appuy</hi> or feeling of the Bit equal and juſt, I ſay if a horſe have theſe qualities, he may be bought without much cauſe of complaint for his price, for there are Merchandices at all rates, and people doe not buy horſes by the bulk or weight as they doe Oxen; A true ſize, Vigour, agreeableneſs, Suppleneſs, Lightneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Strength, are things rare and ſcarce, and for which people pay very dear.</p>
                     <p>Many people would have a horſe with all good qualities and yet give but little money for him, which is moſt unreaſonable and what they cannot expect; becauſe if a man ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Take the Horſe as he cometh out of the Stable, and if poſſible before he hath Rid any that Day, and without animating, or in the leaſt frighting him with your Legs or rod, ſlack your Bridle hand about four fingers breadth, more than it is neceſſary to feel him ou the hand, letting him go at a ſtep according to his own fancy and humour, with his head lolling if he will, and you no ways troubling him; now if you can have but patience to let him walk thus negligently for a quarter of an hour, if he incline to ſtumble he will trip more than once, and perhaps ſalute the ground with his noſe, if he be very ſubject to it; if he be heavy on the hand he will reſt wholly upon the Bit, and be a burden to the Bridle-hand, if he be dull and Lazy, he will diminiſh inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the train of his walk, and will at laſt ſtand ſtill; to put him on again, you muſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179659:61"/>move gently your body and Legs, nay even your Arms, as commonly the Grooms do when they take a Horſe to the Water, and infallibly you will know your Horſe better thus in half an hour, than in half a day by any other method: Again if after having made this proof, you cauſe him go at an attentive pace, and that he be under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of your Spurrs, he will unite all his ſtrength and mettle to pleaſe you, whereas if you ſuffered him to walk on negligently at his pleaſure, he would not much help or advance his ſale; becauſe it is commonly in the firſt hundred yards or ſo, that a Horſe after he hath been ſwitcht or ſpurred, giveth the greateſt token of his Mettle, by reaſon that the fear and apprehenſion of the correction he received, is for ſo long freſh enough in his memory: But if after he is once fred of that apprehenſion, by your negligence in preſſing him on, and ſlackneſs of your thighs and legs, he notwithſtanding go cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forwards with a raiſed and well placed head, and champing his bit, his ſtep well raiſed and reſolute, without either ſtumbling or ſtricking upon the Clods or Stons in the way, I ſay without doubt ſuch a Horſe cannot but be vigorous and mettled, and alſo go well; theſe are the Horſes which a man may venture to buy at a dear rate, for there are but few of this make.</p>
                     <p>For Horſes again which <hi>Amble,</hi> they ſhould go roundly and equally, that is, their hind quarters ſhould accompany exactly their fore, and not go as if they were in two peices or halfs, but above all, you ſhould obſerve if the perſons which are upon them, make but a little motion with their bodies, which will be a certain token that ſuch Horſes go well, and that not only the Amble, but alſo the Step.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, a Horſe in Ambling ſhould go with an equal time or cadance, that is, all his ſteps ſhould be of an equall meaſure, and not three quick and perhaps as many ſlow, but with his head and neck high and well raiſed, and his haunches low; becauſe thoſe Hackneys with high and unbended Haunches, go uneaſily, weary themſelves, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue the Rider; there are ſome Amblers which raiſe up their Croups every ſtep they make, ſo that their hind-quarters move like the Waves of the Sea, which are always riſing and falling, this is a very bad way of Ambling, which ſoon wearyeth Horſes, and hindreth them to Rid any great length, becauſe they do not Ride with their Haunches low and plyed: For all Horſes which do not Amble with their Haunches thus low and plyed, can never go agreeably nor eaſily; but beſides this, they ſhould have alſo a ſufficient movement in their fore-legs, which will add conſiderably to the Gracefulneſs of their Amble.</p>
                     <p>The beſt obſervation for Amblers, and to know if they really go well, is to take notice if they overlay much in Ambling, which is, if with their hind feet they overpaſs a foot and a half, or two foot, the print of their fore, for the more they overpaſs them with their hind feet, the better will they Amble, and the worſe if they do not, becauſe it is impoſſible for them thus to overpaſs with their hind-feet the treads of their fore, without plying conſiderably their Haunches, which is the perfection of the Amble.</p>
                     <p>If people have not taken exact notice to the motions of a Horſes legs upon the Amble, they will ſcarcely believe how it is poſſible that an Ambler, which lifteth the fore and hind-legs of the ſame ſide and at one and the ſame time, while the two legs of the other ſide are upon the ground, and ſo alternatively, ſhould yet ſet down theſe two legs which were in the Air the one before the other and not at one and the ſame time; however it is a Matter of Fact, and if you take notice to it, you will find that he ſetteth his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot firſt to the ground, and then afterwards, but very quickly, his hind foot is ſet down, juſt as the two feet of the other ſide, wherewith he did not lead, are beginning to be raiſed, and when theſe two which did lead are upon the ground, then the two of the other ſide are raiſed and make the ſame motion; and ſo ſucceſſively the one ſide after the other, which is pretty odd, and very well worth obſervation; <hi>What our Author ſays here of a Horſes ſetting down in an Amble, his forefoot before the hind of the ſame ſide, notwithſtanding of their being both raiſed from the ground at the ſame time, may hold in ſome Horſes, but doth not in all, as you may eaſily diſcover, by an exact obſervation of but half a ſcore or a dozen different Horſes, as they are Ambling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many travelling Horſes, which have their Haunches ſo very ſtiff, that they cannot at all ply them as they are Riding, which maketh them ſo uneaſy, that they very much fatigue and trouble the Back and Reins of the Rider, when they are but even going at a foot-pace, and they are thoſe Horſes which are half ruined, and ſpoilt with carying large Clock-bags and Mails, that are moſt ſubject to this imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that when they have no Clock bag or large Port-manteau upon their Croups, they go with their haunches very ſtraight and ſtiff, but if you load them with a pretty heavy Mail, they will then ride agreeably enough, becauſe of their being thereby conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>In ſine, whatever kind of pace a horſe goe, if he be upon his haunches he will be ſo much the more agreeable and eaſie; there are ſome horſes which as they come firſt out of the ſtable, ply their haunches and goe very low behind, but they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long at it, becauſe it is too conſtrained a motion; for the horſe perhaps unites al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There are however ſome horſes which having very good and excellent Reins, ply their haunches and goe upon them at their very firſt coming out, but then this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It now remains that I diſcourſe of thoſe horſes, which goe ſhuffling and mixt kind of paces, which generally ſpeaking are worth nothing, for as ſuch paces are either a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the amble and walk, called in French <hi>L'entre pas</hi> or <hi>traquenard,</hi> or of the amble and Gallop, in French <hi>L'aubin,</hi> a horſe cannot continue at them, and commonly ſuch horſes are fretful and hery, which obliges them at their firſt outſetting to take themſelve to ſuch kind of ſhuffling paces: Sometimes alſo they proceed from a weakneſs either in their reins or legs; but if it hath never been a horſes cuſtom before, to goe a ſhuffling pace betwixt the walk and amble, and that you find he now inclines to it of his own accord, it is almoſt always a token, that his legs are either ſpoilt or weak, and that he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects by this mixt kind of pace to give eaſe to them: The publick meſſengers Mail-horſes which are theſe that carry the panniers or packs, take up this kind of pace by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the large pack-ſadles, and by degrees learn to Amble as they ſpoil in their legs and become old.</p>
                     <p>Some ambles which are forced, that is, horſes which have been conſtrained to amble by help of the Tramel, without having any diſpoſition to it, are many times not very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and eaſie; becauſe they don't commonly keep at it above half an hour, after which they take themſelves to their accuſtomed pace, and go either at a ſtep or a pitiful ſhort Trot: 'Tis true that the moſt part of Engliſh horſes have an amble, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not at all natural to them, but which they have been artificially taught, and indeed no horſes in the world amble better than they doe, for they are taught it with a great dale of art; and many Colts have at two years old the Tramel put to them, when they are at Graſs, and are left ſo in the fields with them every Summer, both night and day untill they be four years old, which is the age at which they commonly begin to back them, ſo that by this long habit of running with the Tramel, they contract a ſecond Nature, and either Amble as they are preſſed, or uſe their natural pace when they are ſuffered to goe ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>I have my ſelf attempted to teach ſeveral Horſes to Amble, both by the help of Tramels, and without them only by the hand, but they never arrived to ſuch a perfection in it, as many Horſes I have ſeen come from <hi>England,</hi> even although the method of teaching it was diſcovered to me, by one of the moſt expert and skilful in that imployment; for he would have perfected and confirmed ſome horſes in the Amble in fifteen dayes time, and that only by the hand without the Aſſiſtance of the Tramel; but that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to thoſe I deſigned to teach, was, that there Legs were all ſpoilt and galled with it, and by the violence they ſuffered in going ſuch a conſtrained motion, they became many times lame; in ſhort the moſt part of them came only ſuch a length, that they were more fit for deceiving People, than yeilding any good and profitable ſervice,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179659:62"/>ſo that if any perſon have a deſign to try his skill this way, I adviſe him to follow no other method than that practiſed by the Engliſh, which he may find ſet down in the 33 Chapter of the Supplement of Horſemanſhip annexed to this firſt part.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe hath naturally a mixt pace, and that he goes ſometimes the motion of the Amble, and other times the Trot or Walk, it is very fit and reaſonable to apply the Tramel to him, that ſo it may aſſiſt nature to confirm him in a pace, and which may prove alſo a very great help to give him ſuch an Amble, as may be both true and of long continuance, whereas if you did not make uſe of the Tramel, there would happen this inconveniency that he would go the <hi>Traquenard,</hi> which is a mixt and ſhuffling kind of motion, and but a very bad pace.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe hath an inclination to Amble, the Engliſh method of Tramling ſucceeds very well: Now the motion of the Walk is different enough from that of the Gallop, and the qualities which a horſe ſhould have to make him walk well, are quite different from theſe he ſhould have that ſo he may gallop well, nay they are almoſt quite contrary: Becauſe to walk well he ſhould tread hard and firm, whereas to gallop well he ſhould ſcarcely ſuffer his feet to touch the ground, which is the way people expreſs themſelves, when they would ſignifie that a horſe ſhould gallop lightly and eaſily; and it is upon this account that horſes which walk very well, do commonly never gallop in perfection, and that thoſe which gallop perfectly, do upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary never walk exactly well; however there are horſes which have both a good walk and excellent gallop, but they are rare and hard to be got: A horſe that hath a had walk, will run ſo much the better, provided he have alſo mettle.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe which is deſigned for hunting, ſhould be Vigorous and full of mettle, gallop upon his haunches, and but graze ſlightly upon the ground with his feet, that is, ſhould goe ſmooth, and not raiſe his fore-feet too high, but liſt them eaſily and without much trouble, his head and Neck high and well placed, without reſting too mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is what I promiſed to diſcover to you, concerning the faults and imperfections of horſes; and if you have exactly underſtood what I have ſaid, and that with attention you goe gradually from one part to another as I have ordered, I am certainly perſwaded you cannot be impoſed upon or deceived when a buying one: But if you think you are not as yet skilful enough to rely upon your own choiſe, I adviſe you to conſider well whom you imploy to aſſiſt you, and eſpecially beware of thoſe <hi>qutbus prater lucruns nihil eſt dulce.</hi> It is now full time that I draw this part of the preſent treatiſe to a cloſe, which certainly for its uſefulneſs cannot be too long, and if any perſon will take the trouble to augment and enlarge it, he will do me a conſiderable peice of kindneſs. I have as yet ſome uſeful circumſtances to diſcover, which relate to the buying of horſes, ſuch as the Colour, White hair which cometh upon the legs, and Feathers, which are a kind of natural frilling, or rather turning of the hair, upon ſeveral parts of the Body, and other ſuch like things, which I intend to diſcourſe of in the following Chapters, becauſe they are pretty curioſities, and ſought after and inquired into with a great dale of nicety and care.</p>

                     <p>Moreover, what is it that gives an eaſie Gentleneſs and Adreſs to Horſes, and oblige them to travell and gallop upon their haunches, but a well regulate mannage? Alſo for the walk, a man may try if a young Horſe which have been trotted for ſome time according to the rules of art, will not go the one half better than he did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, both more ſwiftly, lightly, and more agreeably; but this is matter of fact which cannot be denyed, having had experience of it my ſelfe a hundred times, and I have alſo had ſome horſes of Ten years of age under my cuſtody, which would never go at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:179659:63"/>this, I pray, be performed without the aſſiſtance of the mannage, and Art? or is it to ſpoil a horſe which hath not a juſt ſtep or walk to teach him one? and yet what is it but the Mannage and Art of Riding which doth this? or is it to ſpoil an Engliſh or French galloper, to teach him to run upon his haunches, whereas formerly he gallop't upon his ſhoulders? or can it be done without Art and being a good Horſe-man? no ſurely.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome brisk and airy Sparks may ſay, that this can be done by frequently courſing of him, which let it be ſo, yet after they have courſed him never ſo long, do they imagine that he is ever a whit the more upon his haunches for it? perhaps indeed he may be put upon them by it, when he is quite ſpoilt, and hath hardly any legs at all: As for the flancks, no body doubts but a too great quantity of Hay contributes to make Horſes purſy; for Mannage-Horſes, they get no more Hay than what is ſufficient to cauſe them drink luſtily, but for journey Horſes upon travel they give them what they can eat of it, that by ſo ſtrong a food they may continue or recover to them their fleſh and ſpirits, which they have loſt by their great fatigue: Another certain ſign that the Mannage doth not trouble or ſpoil horſes, is that they are there maintained in good caſe and exceeding plump upon almoſt half the food that people give commonly to journey or travelling horſes.</p>
                     <p>I think I may now conclude this Chapter with a very true Maxim, which is, that a well regulare Mannage is to horſes, what the Lapidaries Art is to an unpoliſh't Diamond, ſeeing from a kind of rough Peeble, it becometh by the Art of the work-man an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fit for kings; and ſo the underſtanding and skilful Horſeman, does by his Art ſupple a horſe and increaſe his gentleneſs, facilitating to him the means whereby he may agreeably imploy and make uſe of his ſtrength and vigour, and ſo be fit for the ſervice of Kings, to carry them off from the greateſt dangers, and to make them be admired in Triumphs and publick <hi>Carouſels;</hi> all which could never be without the aſſiſtance of the Mannage, as the Diamond would have continued but as a peice of rough Peeble without the Lapidaries Art; there might be a great dale more writ upon this matter, ſhould I exceed the limits to which I have confined my ſelfe; but if any perſon reliſh the little I have ſaid, and that his curiofity excite him to know more, Let him read the works of <hi>Mouſieur La Broue,</hi> and theſe of the great Duke of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> which are later, or even the ſecond Chapter of the Supplement of Horſemanſhip at the end of this firſt part, and he will there learn that there is as great a difference between a Horſe which hath been mounted in his younger years by a good Horſe-man, and another which hath not, as there is between a dancing Maſter, and a common Porter or Country Clown, and likewiſe, that the Horſe which hath been rid according to the rules of Art, will be preſerved and laſt near double the time he would have done, had he not been thus ſuppled and put upon his haunches.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Bright,</hi> or <hi>Light Coloured Sorrel,</hi> hath commonly the Main and Tail white, and is not much worth.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Burnt-Sorrel,</hi> is a Sorrel of a very deep Brown and Rediſh colour; and ſhould have always the Main and Tail white, but they are very rarely of another colour; and this is alſo both a beautiful and good colour.</p>
                     <p>The moſt part of Sorrel Horſes, except ſuch as have their Flanks of a Pale colour, and their extremities White, have always a very ſenſible feeling of the Spurs, that is, that they anſwer them readily; and are alſo frequently of a Cholerick conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>There are other mixt kinds of colours, ſuch as the <hi>Rubican,</hi> which is, when a Black, or Sorrel Horſe, hath White hairs ſcattered here and there upon his body, but eſpecially upon his Flanks.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mouſe-colour</hi> or <hi>Dun</hi> ſufficiently explains its ſelf; there are Horſes of this colour which have black liſts along their Backs, called <hi>Eel-backt;</hi> others have their Legs and Hams liſted or rayed with black, after the faſhion of ſome Mules, with their Mains and Tails quite Black, and others are not ſo; ſome again are of a bright <hi>Dun</hi> colour, and other of a very Dark, but theſe laſt are the moſt ſerviceable eſpecially if their extremities be Black.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Wolfe-colour</hi> is if two kinds, either Bright or ſomewhat Dark, if it be very Bright it reſembles much the <hi>Iſabella</hi> colour, ſuch Horſes have always, or at leaſt ſhould have a Black liſt along their Backs, with their extremities, or Main, Tail, and legs black; and are for the moſt part very good.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tiger-colour,</hi> is almoſt the ſame with the Branded or black ſpotted Gray before mentioned, only that in the Tiger colour, the ſpots are not by far ſo big and large as in the Branded or Black ſpotted Gray.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which are called <hi>Purſlain-coloured,</hi> becauſe their bodies which are white, are ſtained here and there with ſtrange and odd kind of Spots, ſomewhat like thoſe that are to be ſeen upon Veſſels made of Purſlain; theſe are rare colours of Horſes, and therefore very proper for a King or General Perſon to appear upon, in a day of publick Joy and Triumph, eſpecially if they have alſo the other qualifications which are required in a fine and well ſhapt horſe, to cauſe them to be noticed.</p>
                     <p>From the mixture of different colours, are produced a great many others, which have their denominations from that colour which they moſt reſemble.</p>
                     <p>Having deſcribed the ſeveral colours and told their names, we muſt next draw ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from them, whereby we may judge of the temperature, and of the humouz which predominats the which will diſcover to us, whether the horſe be of a fretful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, dull and heavy, or mettled and vigorous; ſo that by this means knowing once the qualities of the colour, a man may with the more certainty buy a Horſe, having always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and relying upon the preceeding obſervations; and not only this, but alſo order and regulate better the purging and diſpenſing of Medicaments to Horſes, if he be ſo unlucky as to have any which are either indiſpoſed or ſick; notwithſtanding that the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi> in his large book of Riding printed in French, treats <hi>èn ridicule</hi> all ſuch as regard either colour or marks, wherefrom to draw any knowledge of their goodneſs and excellency; but I believe himſelf is the only perſon who is of this opinion, although he be otherwiſe very knowing and skilful in both Horſes and Horſemanſhip; He alſo laughs at thoſe who ſay that a Horſe is compoſed and nouriſhed by the four Elements, for ſaith he, both Men and Horſes receive their ſuſtenance from Meat and Drink only, in which he is moſt certainly in the right; but then he ſhould have conſidered that meats and drinks, and that of what kind ſoever, are all compounded of the four Elements.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are compoſed, as Men, of Humours which have a certain affinity and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Elements; Phyſicians make four kinds of them, by which they regulate and determine peoples conſtitutions, which they call <hi>Sanguinian, Bilous</hi> or <hi>Cholerick, Phlegmatick,</hi> and <hi>Melancholick;</hi> I ſhall diſcourſe of theſe at more length, when I treat of the method of Purging, which is near to the cloſe of this firſt part, and therefore it ſhall at preſent ſuffice, that I ſay the Sanguine Complexion hath an affinity to Air, the Bilous or Cholerick to Fire, the Phlegmatick to Water, and the Melancholick to Earth; ſo that to proceed to the knowlege of what humour predomines, you ſhall not ſatisfy your ſelf with remarking only the Colour, but you ſhall alſo join to this obſervation, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Horſes principal actions, and if you find that they correſpond with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179659:65"/>colour, then you may with certainty conclude upon the temper and diſpoſition of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>This Aſſinity and correſpondence between the Humours and Elements being ſuppoſed, you muſt next know in which colours it is, that ſuch and ſuch an humour predomines, which is what I am going to explain, without however poſitively affirming it to you as a thing infallible, for ſeing this obſervation may come to fail in ſome circumſtances, I don't pretend to make it paſs as an infallible demonſtration, nor to eſtabliſh thereby an aſſured knowledge; I only diſcourſe of it according to the experience I have had, which hath very rarely deceived me; but becauſe there may be poſſibly ſome exceptions in it, you are therefore to make uſe of it with the greater diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Now the four principal colours, which have an Affinity and Relation to the four humours in the Body, and which alſo correſpond with the Elements, are theſe following the <hi>Black</hi> is commonly Melancholick, that is the Melancholick humour predomines moſt in a Horſe which is of this colour, and prevails over the reſt of the Humours; if the horſe which is Black have a Star in his fore-head, or a white foot, it is a good mark, and ſuch Horſes are ſtrong and ſprightly, but if he be all Coal Black and not a White ſpot upon him, then he will be Melancholick, and conſequently Terreſtrail, Dull, and ofttimes double Hearted, that is, he will have two Wills, one to obey, not being able to reſiſt becauſe of his being Maſtered by the rules of Art, and the other to refuſe and diſobey: The <hi>Hungartans</hi> hold it for a certain truth, that a Man who is mounted upon a Black Horſe, even although he have no White at all upon him, is more ſuccesful in War, than if he were upon a Horſe of any other colour; I believe the ground of this may be, becauſe Black Horſes are very rare and ſcarce in theſe Countries, and alſo that they are not ſo well perceived at a diſtance by an Enemy, as if they were of an other colour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spantards</hi> have ſo great an eſteem for Horſes which are Black all over, called in French <hi>Chevaux Zaines,</hi> that they have a proverb which ſayeth, <hi>Morſille ſin ſenus muchos lo quieren, y pocos lo han,</hi> whereby they eſteem thoſe happy who have a Coal Blad Horſe, without the leaſt White ſpot upon him.</p>
                     <p>Again in <hi>France,</hi> they look upon Jet Black Horſes which have no White marks: all upon them, as unluckie, and think alſo that all Horſes, which have not a White Stare Blaze in their fore-heads, are defective, which is not without reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sorrel</hi> colour is Bilous or Cholerick, and hath aſſinity with Fire; A hore then of this colour will be Cholerik, Frettfull and Light, and will have a diſpoſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The <hi>Bright</hi> and <hi>Dark</hi> Sorrels, are more or leſs Cholerick, as their Colours at Light or Dark, and if they have White marks upon them it is a good ſign; becauſe White correſpondeth with, and is a token of Phlegme, which by its coldneſs qualifies the exceſſive heat of Bile or Choler, and ſo maketh the Horſe of an excellent diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>But if he be a very Dark Sorrel, then he will have Melancholie mixed with his Bile and it is ſo much the better; becauſe by its weight it will fix his Choler, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> Horſes which are Flea-bitten or have ſmall Dark ſpots upon their Heads, Necks, and Shoulders, are commonly execellent, and if they have them over all their body, the mark is ſo much the better, but if they have them only upon their hind quarters and none upon their fore, then they are rarely good; ſo that you ſee the White which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> a mixture of Black, maketh a very good diſpoſition as I have already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Deer-Colour</hi> ſufficiently explaineth it ſelf by the reſemblance it hath to that of a <hi>Deer;</hi> if ſuch Horſes have their extremities, as Main, Tail, and Legs, Black, they will prove good, and if they have likwiſe a Black liſt along their backs, they will be ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p>Horſes of a <hi>Bay</hi> colour are Sanguine, which is an execllent complexion, they are alſo commonly brisk and hearty, feed with a good appetite, and ride deliberatly.</p>
                     <p>If a Horſe partake of all the Elements in a due and juſt proportion, he will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good; now I ſhall tell you the chief of thoſe which have this equal mixture of humours.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:179659:65"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Cheſnut-Bay</hi> of a lively colour, with a Star in his Fore-head, deriveth his chief temper from the Sanguine humour, which is the moſt excellent; they have always their extremities Black, which ſignifies that they partake alſo of Melancholie; again this livelyneſs of their hair proceeds from Bile, and the White Stars in their fore heads are a token of Phlegme: So when you obſerve in a Horſe the four humours thus propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably aſſembled and united, he cannot fail to be excellent, eſpecially the Sanguine humour predominating as it doth here.</p>
                     <p>With a little experience, and ſolide judgment, it is eaſie to draw the like conſequences from the other mixtures of colours, which I might here ſet down, would it not prove tedious, and perhaps of no great uſe; it will be therefore in my opinion ſufficient, to diſcover to you which are the beſt colours in general.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dapple-Gray</hi> is excellent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Flea-Bitten,</hi> or colour of a Starling, which hath good eyes, cannot fail to prove good.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roan</hi> with a Black or Moors head, in French <hi>Caveſſe de More,</hi> or <hi>Cap de Maure,</hi> is moſt Excellent, Vigorous, and Hardie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Burnt</hi> or <hi>Dark Sorrel,</hi> never faileth.</p>
                     <p>This is an abrigment of the moſt excellent colours, and which are beſt temper'd and moſt eſteemed: after theſe, thoſe colours which come neareſt to, and reſemble them moſt, are the beſt, although there are of all colours and marks good.</p>
                     <p>This reaſoning, will with a little experience make you come to underſtand, that thoſe Horſes which have too much White, are commonly weak and foible, it is a colour which I have omitted to explain, becauſe it abundantly diſcovereth it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are of the colour of a Peach flower or bloſſome, or which approach near to that colour, are neither much ſenſible nor very couragious and bold, although otherwiſe their colour be very becoming and beautifull.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Dapple-Gray</hi> is ſo excellent, is according to our former reaſoning, becauſe his Phlegme is animated by his Aduſt Choler or Burnt Bile, and thereby becometh the Lighter; now from this mixture of Bile and Phlegine, doth reſult an excellent temper and complexion, full of Life and Vigour, but which for the moſt part is not very ſenſible of, or obedient to the Spurrs.</p>
                     <p>Here is abundance of matter, from the variety and diverſity of colours and their properties, to ſwell this Book to a large Volum; and a Man might here ſhew very well his ability and parts; but the Reader may draw abundance of knowledge from what hath been ſaid, whereby to ſatisfie himſelf in this matter, which I ſhall quit at preſent, that I may diſcourſe of white footed Horſes.</p>

                     <p>To have only the near hind foot White, is a good mark, and if the Horſe have alſo with it a Star in his Fore-head, it is the beſt of all Marks, and is very rarely known to fail, for me I never knew many bad Horſes with this Mark: In <hi>Germany</hi> they have ſuch an eſteem for it, that it will make them heighten conſiderably a Horſes price, and if with this mark he alſo raiſe his feet well, that is, have a good movement with his Legs when Trotting, it will double his price in a publick Faire; but however I would not give one piſtol more for him upon that account, if he had not alſo all the other good qualities one would wiſh for; when a Horſe raiſes or trouſſes his Legs very well as he is Trotting, people ſay he hath a good movement, which is one of the moſt becoming and beautiful actions for the Manage that a Man can deſire or wiſh for, but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To have only the two Fore-feet White is a bad Mark, but not very common; I have known but few Horſes which had this Mark, neither were they very much worth, and they are alſo lookt upon to be unluckie: if the Horſe had with this Mark one of his hind-feet White, and had likewayes a Star in his Fore-head, this would in ſome meaſure dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the badneſs of his Mark, but not wholly: Such Horſes as have too much White upon their Face, are ſaid to have moiſt Brains, and conſequently to be ſubject to many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, eſpecially theſe which proceed from a cold and moiſt cauſe.</p>

                     <p>A Horſe which hath two White feet behind, and one before, without having a Star in his fore-head, will be badly marked, but if he have a Star, it may paſs for ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different good one.</p>
                     <p>Theſe horſes which have three White feet, with a Star in their fore-head, are by the Italians called <hi>Kingly Horſes,</hi> but for what reaſon I know not, for I do'nt ſee that they are better then others: But perhaps they call them Kingly, becauſe horſes which are kept in Kings Stables work little, and that a horſe which hath three White feet, being proper but for a moderate Labour or exerciſe, is therefore only fit for a King.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome White footed horſes which are called <hi>Tramled</hi> or <hi>Traverſed,</hi> in french <hi>Travat,</hi> and others again <hi>Croſs-Tramled</hi> or <hi>Croſs-Traverſed,</hi> in french <hi>Traſtravat;</hi> I ſhall explain both.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe which hath only two feet of a ſide White is called <hi>Tramled</hi> or <hi>Traverſed,</hi> becauſe of the reſemblance thoſe White feet have to the hoſes of a half Tramel; it is a bad mark, and beſides that ſuch horſes are ſubject to fall and ſtumble, they are alſo lookt upon not to be good.</p>
                     <p>Again a horſe which is Croſs-White-footed, that is, which hath only his near fore-foot and far hind-foot White, is called <hi>Croſs-Tramled</hi> or <hi>Croſs-Traverſed,</hi> becauſe of the ſame reſemblance of the hoſes of a half Tramel being placed from fore leg to hind Croſs, and not upon one ſide as the former; this mark is worſe then <hi>Arzel,</hi> or having but only the far hind foot White, and although the horſe have a Star with it, yet he is not much the better for it.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe which hath his far fore foot and near hind foot White, is Croſs Tramled or Traverſed as well as the preceeding, becauſe of his White feet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both upon one ſide, but Croſs-ways, and it is a mark not much better then the former, although many people look upon it to be a very good one, eſpecially if the horſe have a Star with it; but I have obſerved the contrary in all thoſe, which were thus Croſs-Tramled in their far fore and near hind feet; the Star in the fore-head diminiſhes indeed a little the badneſs of the mark, but doth not rectifie it wholly.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe which hath four White feet, or is, as we ſay, White in all four, is tractable and of a good Nature and diſpoſition, but commonly not very ſtrong, and his fore-feet will incline to be brittle, becauſe of the Whitneſs of their hoofs or horn.</p>
                     <p>It is a received Maxim, that the higher the White of any Horſes feet aſcends upon the legs, he is ſo much the worſe, becauſe he thereby reſembles ſo much more the Pye-balds, of which there are few found to be good, and people alſo ſay of ſuch horſes, that their Stockins are pulled too high: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he reaſon why Pye-Balds, and horſes which have the White of their feet riſing too high upon their legs, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted defective, proceeds from this, that the phlegme which is betokened by the White hair, doth too much predomine, and make them weaker then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would be.</p>
                     <p>If the Whites which are upon a Horſes legs end in ſmall points, or as it were indented, or that it be freckled with Black little ſpots, I ſay if the mark of ſuch White feet be good, this indenting or freckling will increaſe its goodneſs, and if it be bad, the freckling will make it not quite ſo ill; now the reaſon of this may be, becauſe the phlegme doth not govern alone, but is corrected by ſome other humour, which aſſiſts the horſe with more vigour; however the reaſons of the goodneſs and badneſs of all theſe marks are at beſt but very obſcure, ſo that the ſureſt way is, either to refer them to the experience of our anceſtors, or to rely no more upon them then a Man has a mind to, or judges convenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ermined White feet,</hi> are thoſe which are freckled with Black little ſpots all around the Coronets; it is ane excellent mark, and if the mark of the White feet be good, this augmenteth it, if bad, it qualifies and corrects it, and if indiffrent, it maketh it good; in fine, I can aſure you that all the Ermin'd White footed horſes which I have ſeen, proved always good.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179659:68"/>pampered up and fed very nicely for ſometime, and that with a great dale of care and trouble; he may have alſo become fat and well bellyed, by a long reſting in the ſtable without any kind of exerciſe, and yet may diſguſt and looſe his appetite by the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue or xerciſe; but if you cauſe give him a good meaſure of Oats, and that he eat them without intermiſſion, and ſo much as taking his Noſe from amongſt them untill they be all eat up, this will be a ſign that he eats his Oats well, which is a great matter.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Horſes which as they eat their Oats, take their heads out of the Manger to chaw them, and yet continue to eat them all up without intermiſſion; thoſe Horſes have a good Appetite, but by taking their heads thus frequently out of the Manger, they looſe a great dale of their Oats, and it is alſo an unquiet and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming kind of Action, eſpecially if they have a trick of looking behind them; but for a Horſe to eat as he ought, that is, heartily and with a good appetite, he ſhould from the time that he puts his Noſe amongſt his Oats, not remove it again untill they are all eat up; and what ſign ſoever of greedineſs a Horſe may diſcover at his firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to eat his Oats, yet if he forſake them and fall to eating of his hay, (I ſuppoſe alwayes that the Oats are freſh and no wayes muſty) a man may then conclude that he hath no good appetire.</p>
                     <p>If the horſe be Light-belly'd, a man ſhould not buy him but upon condition of have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nights Cuſtody of him, that ſo he may have time enough to know if he eat his hay heartily, and he ſhould give him about fifteen or twenty pound weight of it, whereof if there be none nixt morning remaining, he will have a good appetite; he is alſo to or ſerve if he drink well.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are Light-belly'd, although they may eat their Oats heartily upon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, yet for the moſt part do not eat much Hay, nor conſequently drink luſtily, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fit to take notice to it when buying them, for they have a great difficulty to ſubſiſt thus without Hay in Traveling, becauſe with Oats alone they are too much overheated, when a man is obliged to give a great quantity of them, that ſo they may ſupply the want of Hay; if a Horſe which is light belly'd be alſo fiery and fretful, he will never take to a belly, although he may both eat and drink very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and have his ribs alſo abundantly deep and well turned; but if he be both light belly'd and have ſhort turned ribs, then it will be ſo much the worſe for him.</p>
                     <p>A man ſhould alſo before concluding the bargain, obſerve if the horſe be not a Ticker, that is, ſubject to the infirmity, or rather bad cuſtom called the <hi>Tick,</hi> which is known by perceiving either his under or upper teeth all uſed and worne, but yet a great dale better by ſeeing him eat; for he will preſs againſt the edge of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with his upper teeth, and give a kind of belch thorow his throat, which action and noiſe is called the Tick, and with this infirmity or bad habite I would not take a Horſe for many reaſons; firſt, a horſe which Ticketh thus, looſeth a part of his Oats as he is eating them, becauſe as he Ticketh he openeth alwiſe his mouth, and ſo they fall from it, this is the firſt inconveniency; the ſecond is, that by continual ticking he ſo filleth his body with wind. that it will be apt to give him a Cholick which may make him burſt.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, a horſe which is a Ticker having once become lean, can but with great difficulty be fattened and made Inſty again, and they are alſo commonly but Light-body'd.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, this infirmity or bad cuſtom communicats it ſelf to other horſes, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion or infection, but horſes, eſpecially thoſe which are young, learn i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some horſes Tiek with their upper teeth by preſſing them againſt the Manger, and ſome doe the ſame with their under Teeth, both which they ſpoil and wear with this trick.</p>
                     <p>Again others Tick with their Chins againſt the Manger, which obliges them to keep their mouths ſhut, theſe do not looſe their Oats, neither can a man know that they have this bad cuſtome, but by actually ſeeing them do it, for they ſpoil not at all their teeth with it, as the others do.</p>
                     <p>There are others again which Tick upon the Halter or Collar, by taking it betwixt there Teeth; now Ticking after this Faſhion, a man can not know it more by the Teeth then the former, but by actually ſeeing them do it, which muſt be in the ſtable, But there are others which Tick in the open Air, without the help or aſſiſtance of any reſt, and others when they are bridled, by the aſſiſtance of the Bit-mouth as ſome Coach Horſes, do alſo upon the Pole-tree when they are put to the Coach.</p>

XXVI How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve horſes ſound and hearty upon Travel.</note> take great care to ſee them well fed and look't after, that ſo they may be preſerved ſound and healthful, and yet they many times fail in it, either for want of experience and reflection, upon what hath already befallen them, or for lack of the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and directions, which will prove moſt uſeful and eaſie to practiſe; neither ſhall I affirme or ſay any thing but what I have experienced, and have had the proof of its good ſucceſs, in ſeveral journeys I have been obliged to make, in which the horſes by a few precautions, and ſmall charges, inſtead of being ruined and ſpoilt after two or three hundred Leagues riding, were plump, Freſh, and their Legs as good and ſound as when they firſt ſet out.</p>
                     <p>People have alſo known large ſized Horſes, as well as Barbs, Spaniſh Horſes, and others of this ſize, which men make commonly moſt uſe of in any kind of ſervice or action, to have had there legs as ſound after four or five Campaigns, as they were the firſt, and that only by the care and directions which I ſhall give you.</p>
                     <p>But before I diſcourſe of what is to be obſerved in time of a journy, I ſhall give ſome advices anent preparing for it, that ſo a Man may not be put to the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and charges, to which theſe perſons are who neglect them.</p>
                     <p>And I give this advice particularly to ſuch, as have the commands or charge of an Equipage, becauſe for not having the horſes commodiouſly fitted with Saddles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore parting, they will become ſeverely galled and hurt, even almoſt to death; thoſe who have ſerved in the Wars in <hi>Italy, Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> have at their own proper charges experimented this truth, and know that it is one of the moſt neceſſary things for horſes which are imployed in the Wars, to have them exactly well fitted with Saddles; and there is the ſame reaſon for thoſe which are to make a long journy; for it is an inconveniency, the uneaſyneſs whereof cannot be expreſt, to be making uſe of horſes which are always galled and hurt beneath the Sadle; I ſhall therefore give you exact directions, not only for this, but all other things belonging to a Journy.</p>
                     <p>You are then to cauſe ſhoe your horſe that he may be at his eaſe, and that the ſhoes be neither too ſtrait nor preſs his feet, but be exactly ſhaped and fitted according to the Rules which I ſhall hereafter give you for ſhoing, as alſo that they be made of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old caſt ſhoes, or a tough kind of Iron that will not eaſily break.</p>
                     <p>If it be in the Summer time, and that your horſe is very ſenſible of the Flies it will be fit that his hind ſhoes have at their Toes, that which we call a Beak which is nothing elſe but a little of the ſhoe at the Toe about the length of ane inch, turned up, and faſtned in upon the fore part of the hoof, there is not a Smith who hath had the leaſt experience in his imployment, but what knows it, and at <hi>Paris</hi> they ſhoe all the Coatch Horſes, which have begun but lately to draw and trot upon the ſtreets, with theſe kind of Beaks upon their ſhoes.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:179659:70"/>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why they make uſe of them, is becauſe the Horſes pulling always up their hind-feet to their Bellys, to drive away the Flies and ſetting or ſtricking them down again with force upon the ground, do by this violent kind of motion, beat of their ſhoes every minute, and ſo break and ſpoil their hoofs.</p>
                     <p>This Beak upon the ſhoes of the hind feet, is alſo a ſoveraign remedy to prevent ſuch horſes looſing of their ſhoes, which by reaſon of any itch, ſtrike violently while they are in the Stable, with their hind feet againſt the ground; for it keepeth their ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>It is indeed true, that it is not ſo dangerous for horſes to travel a little wanting their hind ſhoes, as their fore, however if it be in a Stonny Country, their feet would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſpoil with ſo frequently looſing their ſhoes, and faſtning them on again; be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter obſerving your horſes ſhoes and bridle,<note place="margin">CHAP: XXVII How to fit a horſe with a convenient Saddle.</note> you are next to conſider if he be well Saddled, and that it be ſo exactly fitted to him that it cannot hurt him. It is not enough that the Saddle be adjuſted to the horſe, it ſhould be alſo commodious and eaſy for a horſe-man, becauſe if a man ſit not at his eaſe upon a Saddle, he can never place or ſix himſelf exactly in the middle of it, ſo that although the Saddle may be very fit for the horſe, yet the rider charging and preſſing it more in one part then another, it will at laſt ſpoil the horſe, or at leaſt wearie him ſooner, then if the Rider were placed exactly in middle of it.</p>
                     <p>That a Saddle may not ſpoil and gall a horſe, it ſhould all of it reſt equally upon his back, that is, no part of it ſhould more preſs his back than another, neither ſhould it any ways reſt upon his Withers, Reins, or back-bone, which is termed <hi>upon the length of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To know if it reſt equally over all, you muſt cauſe ſome perſon get up on it, for it is only when a Saddle is filled, that this is beſt known, now if it incline to pinch the horſe in any part, you may eaſily perceive it, becauſe that part will be more preſſed by it than any other, whereas it ſhould reſt equally over all; For Example, if the Toes or points of the Saddle's fore-bow preſs too much the horſes ſides, then the upper part of it will be void and hollow, and not cloſs enough to the horſes back, and ſo the Saddle will be too narrow in its Toes or points, and may come to make the horſe halt, but if the points of the Saddle's fore-bow be too wide and open, then they will not touch him at all in that part; but preſs him near to the upper part of the ſaddle, and a little below the Withers, and ſo either hurt and pinch his ſhoulders, or occaſion <hi>Sit-faſts</hi> in thoſe parts, which are very troubleſome and difficult to cure.</p>
                     <p>A Saddle will have alſo the like fault, if the hind-bow do not accompany exactly the ſhape and circumference of the body, where it reſteth; for if it preſs the horſe at its points, then it will not come cloſs enough to his back above, and if it reſt too cloſs upon his back above, then it will be too eaſie at the Toes or points, and ſo will quickly ſpoil the horſe, where it preſſeth moſt.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome horſes, to whom ſaddles are eaſily fitted before, and do not at all ſit right behind; but a ſaddle to be exactly well fitted, ſhould reſt equally over all.</p>
                     <p>When a man hath obſerved, that the two bows are exactly well turned, and fit for the horſe, in ſo far as they reſt equally upon his back, both before and behind, he muſt next ſee that there be enough of ſtuffing in the Pannels, to preſerve the ſaddle from reſting either upon his Withers, Reins, or ridge of his back.</p>
                     <p>But there ſhould not be too much of it neither; which is the fault of your common country Saddlers, who put as much ſtuffing in the pannels of a riding ſaddle, as they do in thoſe of a pack-ſaddle; for there ſhould not be above the thickneſs of two
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179659:71"/>fingers of ſtuffing, and it ſhould be either of Deers hair, or the long hair of horſes Manes and Tails, or even that of the Tails of Oxen, which does not harden near ſo much with the ſweat, as the common pannels ſtuffed with the ordinary hair of Oxen and Cows: the cloath whereof the pannels are made, ſhould be pretty fine, for that which is courſe receives too much ſweat, and thereby becometh preſently hard; Blue cotton Baize is very good for the finer ſort of ſaddles: In <hi>England</hi> they make ſometimes the pannels of very Rich Saddles of Velvet, which is both chargeable and of no extraordinary uſe, there are alſo ſome who cauſe ſtuff their ſaddle pann is with Moſs, which is extreamly well dryed before it be made uſe of, and they ſay it is very propper for this uſe, becauſe it is not ſo apt to harden with ſweat, as other kinds of ſtuffing are.</p>
                     <p>The Saddle ſhould be placed exactly upon the middle of the Back, neither too much forwards nor too far back, becauſe if it be too far back, and that the Horſe be light Bellied, his girths will immediatly fall back to his ſheath, and were it too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Horſe would Ride but very uneaſily, and diſſagreeably: Therefore that the Saddle may be exactly well placed, the Fore-bow ſhould be placed juſt at the want of the Shoulders, which is that part that appears more hollow, eſpecially in lean Horſes, than any other part about the tops of the Shoulders; ſome Sadlers call theſe hollows the Shoulder-pits.</p>
                     <p>You will alſo know when the Saddle is placed too much forwards, becauſe the Skin and Fleſh of the ſhoulder, will be forced as it were forwards, and appear high and raiſed at the points of the fore-Bow, eſpecially when the horſe is in motion; the very ſame will alſo happen if the pannels be too much ſtuft before, or that the Toes of the fore-Bow be too narrow and ſtrait.</p>
                     <p>In fine, you are to hold it for an infallible Maxim, that a Saddle will never hurt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> do, and therefor the uſe of them is excellent, for their horſes are but very rarely galled or hurt with them, only in the Summer time they heat a horſe too much.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> the whole Cavalry followed this method, not of Saddles made all of wood, but to put ſuch cloaths beneath their Saddles, notwithſtanding of their having pannels as thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> and the invention is good; for theſe coverings di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Another invention for Horſes which are Tender-skin'd, and ſubject to galling, notwithſtanding of all the care can be taken to prevent it: Is, to have a Roe-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> or Hinds skin according to the ſize of the horſe, and which is well garniſhed with hair, becauſe otherways it would be too hard: you are to adjuſt this beneath the pannel of the Saddle, and to fix it neatly, that the hair of the skin may be next to the horſe's, now this doeth not harden with ſweat, but prevents extreamly a horſes ſpoiling and galling, and is likewiſe admirable good for ſuch horſes, as have been lately cured of hurts or wounds on the back, becauſe they are very ſubject to gall a new again, and their skins being as yet tender and without hair, are eaſily ruffled and ſpoilt; it is alſo a very good method for horſes which ſweat much, and therefore are ſubject to galling; this method of puting a Roe-buck or Hind's skin beneath the pannel of the ſaddle, is alſo very much uſed by the German Cavalry.</p>
                     <p>Having examined, if the Saddle be fit for your Horſe, you need not much concern your ſelf any further, ſeeing there are at preſent ſo many skilful Sadlers in <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Towns in the Country, who have ſo well imitate the Saddles which come from England, that a Man may rely upon them for a Saddle, which will be eaſy and convenient for the Rider; and they will ſerve you the more carefully, when they ſee you are capable to diſcover their faults, which you will certainly be, if you underſtand what you are immediatly to read.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:179659:71"/>
                     <p>It remains then to be conſidered, that the Rider ſit at his eaſe, which is what the moſt part of people do not underſtand to make enquiry after, for except in the great Citys, a Man will find very few eaſy and well made Saddles, and the common Sadlers know very rarely ſo to make a Saddle, as that it may lye low and near to the Horſe, eſpecially thoſe in the Country, where however I aſſure you, they underſtand better how to order a Saddle, ſo as it may not hurt or gall a Horſe, than in the Citys and great Towns, but to make them ſo as that a Man may ſit and ride at eaſe, is what they are not as yet come the length, or Maſters of.</p>
                     <p>That a Saddle may be commodious for the Rider, it ſhould be low and not too much elevate above the Horſes back, that is, that betwixt the Horſe's Body and Riders Thighs, there ſhould be but a very little diſtance; a Saddle to be eaſy, ſhould not be raiſed much higher before than behind, and for that effect, the fore-bow of it ſhould not be made with a kind of raiſed neck, but the <hi>Saddle-Withers</hi> ſhould be low, and if it be but two or three fingers breadth above the Horſe's Withers, it will be ſufficient, that is, that the upper part of the fore-bow of the Saddle, ſhould be only two or three fingers breadth higher than the Withers of the Horſe, becauſe if they were more, it would be too high; for when a Man is upon a Saddle which is too much elevate before, that is, whoſe upper part of the Fore-bow is exceſſively high, he cannot poſſibly ſit at his eaſe, but muſt be very much fatigued with it, and he will alſo ſoon weary the Horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the motions of his Body come from a diſtance, which make them the greater, and conſequently the more uneaſy for the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The Rider being at a diſtance from the horſes body, as he is when the ſaddle is made very thick, and that the Withers of it are very much elevate, there is a neceſſity that the motion of the Horſe-man be more incommode, as it is greater; this incommodity will weary and fatigue the horſe conſiderably, which ſhould be prevented as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and it is in this, that theſe people who cauſe make the fore-bows or withers of their ſaddles, with half a foot or four inches of a raiſed neck before, are mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; it is an errour ſo old and inveterate in the Provinces, that I don't pretend to rectifie it, but in the moſt refined Towns, People have abſolutely quit it, and any conſiderate Perſon will come to know the truth of what I affirm, and may eaſily make a tryal, that thereafter he may make uſe of it if he ſhall be convinced.</p>
                     <p>My deſign is not to recommend Saddles, whoſe fore-bows at the withers reſt upon the quick; upon the contrary they muſt alwayes be diſtant from the horſe's Withers two or three finger-breadth, and when a man perceives that they lye too near, he ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly rectifie it, by cauſing ſtuff and garniſh the pannels, at that part of them which is called their Breaſts or Paps; but if the Withers of the ſaddle be raiſed only two or three finger-breadth above the Withers of the horſe, then it will hurt him neither one way nor other; for the firſt, which is a high Neck or Withers, will have its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which are great, and the laſt which lyeth pretty low, and not too cloſs upon the horſes Withers, will have its advantages which are conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>That a ſaddle may be convenient and eaſie, both for the Rider and Horſe, it ſhould be almoſt as low before as behind, that is, that the fore part of it ſhould be but a very little more elevate than the hind, unleſs the ſaddle be made after the Scots faſhion, which is a very good method, for the fore-parts of them are faſhioned like that of a great ſaddle, but the fore-bolſters are not ſo high, they are flat upon that ſide next to the ſeat, and the fore part of the ſeat goeth almoſt in a level from them as in a great Saddle, ſo that thus, the Withers of the Saddle is ſufficiently well raiſed above the Withers of the Horſe, and the Rider is not at all incommoded, for the ſeat of the Saddle is almoſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel without, being elevate before, and is joyned to the fore-bolſter after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that of a great Saddle: The uſe of theſe Saddles after the Scots faſhion appears to me to be more convenient, then any I ever made uſe of, and they are alſo very durable, becauſe of their Fore-bolſters, and the whole fore-parts of them being pretty well elevate, and yet no more then they ought; They are alſo made long in the bands or ſeat, if a Man pleaſe, and near to the Horſe's back, which are the qualities of a good and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Saddle.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why people make Saddles which are eaſy, long in the ſeat, is, that a Man may ſit with the more eaſe betwixt the two Bolſters, and that his Thighs may not reſt too much upon that behind, as they do always when the Saddle is too ſhort, and which makes a Man ſit hard and uneaſily, becauſe he is on the wood; Moreover, a Saddle ſhouldly low upon a Horſes back, and have a ſoft ſeat: it will be ſomewhat difficult to perſwade thoſe, who never made uſe of any other Saddles then what they had made in Country Villages, of the Truth of this; but if a man will continue in his Error, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

                     <p>People at firſt uſing of them, find ſome of theſe Engliſh Saddles very hard, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe with skirts, and untill a man be a little accuſtomed to them, he findeth them uneaſy, and his Breech ſuffers by it; but, the habit once acquired, and buttocks hardned, people never quit them, unleſs they be very lean, or have their skin near to the bones; or that they are not much accuſtomed with Riding.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve all the <hi>Horſe-Courſers</hi> which are moſt firm and vigorous on Horſe-back, and you will find, that they never make uſe of any other but Engliſh Saddles.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch perſons as cannot make uſe of theſe, I adviſe them, for Travelling, to make uſe of the half Engliſh ſaddles, which being well ſtuffed and ſoft in the Seat, almoſt as low before as behind, and exactly ſhapt, will although they be ſet upon little Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neatly ſtuffed, be abundantly cloſs and low upon the Horſe's back, and have the ſame conveniences with the full Engliſh ſaddles, without being anyways incommode or uneaſy to thoſe who have ſoft and Tender Buttocks; people make ſuch ſaddles wonderfully well at preſent.</p>
                     <p>Some people, for their conveniency, will have Saddles which are very long in the Bands, but I rather think, they ſhould be proportioned to the Size of the Horſe and Rider, becauſe a big belly'd Horſe-man will require a longer Saddle, than another whoſe Belly and Thighs are not ſo groſs; yet this is not, but that generally ſpeaking long Saddles, or which have a pretty long Seat, are really the moſt convenient for all kind of people; eſpecially when they are to ride Poſt, and that for the reaſons I have already given.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe large Saddles that are very high before, and which are called <hi>àla Royale,</hi> or by what other name you pleaſe, with a broad and very high Seat, well ſtuffed with Feathers, and which keep a Mans Thighs upon each ſide, at half a foot diſtance from the Horſe's ſides, are very uneaſy and worth nothing for ſervice, however they are much made uſe of in <hi>Provence;</hi> They are incommode, in ſo far as being very high before, they throw a man back, and force him to ſit upon his Rump, which does not only weary him extreamly, but is alſo troubleſome to his Reins, whereas in thoſe Saddles, which are low before and cloſs to the Horſe, a Man ſits upon his Twiſt and Thighs, his Reins are not at all troubled, and he Rideth at his eaſe, and although the Horſe ſhould kick or ſtrike out, yet he cannot much incommode the Rider.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe, with ſuch Saddles as are extreamly high before, does but move his Tail, he immediatly throws a Man upon his Noſe, ſo that when he hath made a days Journey or two upon ſuch a big and ill ſhapt Saddle, which may be called more properly a Cloſs-Stool, finding himſelf very much incommoded and wearied, he imagines for the moſt part that it proceeds from his not being accuſtomed to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or from the weakneſs of his Reins; whereas it is almoſt alwayes from the bad ſhape of the Saddle; nevertheleſs the miſtake in this is ſo great, that many people think they cannot have a good Saddle unleſs it be half a foot too high before, very much raiſed above the Horſe, the Seat extreamly broad and large, and the whole Saddle weighing fifty or ſixty pound weight, which may be rather called a Pack-Saddle than one fitt for Travel, and which is only proper to weary the Horſe and fatigue the Rider; but whatever Saddle a Man make choice of, provided it reſt equally upon the horſe's back, and preſs it not more in one part then another (for that part where it preſſeth moſt will ſpoil and gall) it matters not I ſay whether it be Engliſh or Swediſh, provided a Man be pleaſed with it.</p>
                     <p>At preſent, people make Saddles that are called after the Holland faſhion, which have as it were a kind of quilted Roll fixed all around the back part of the Seat; theſe Saddles are very good for thoſe who would ſit eaſily, becauſe with theſe Rolls they can never reſt upon the hind-Bow, and the Seat being well ſtuffed, maketh a Man ſit very ſoft; beſides, they are convenient for tying a Mans Cloak behind him after the German Cuſtom, or for carrying a Port-mantle, which may be made very fixed by the help of

                     <p>Mares are more ſubject to galling beneath their Tails than horſes, becauſe they are commonly low before, but then they have an advantage by it for climbing up the hills; to prevent therefore this diſorder, which is very inconvenient, eſpecially in ſuch beaſts as are Tickliſh, a man muſt have a Saddle which is higher before then ordinary, to ſupply that height which is wanting in the Mare, and ſhould order to put but a very little ſtuffing in the pannels behind, and ſhould alſo make uſe of a Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with two Buckles, ſuch as I have been juſt now deſcribing, for it will keep the Saddle a great deal better fixt in its place then any other, and the Saddle being alſo thus ſhapt will not preſs ſo much forwards, nor hurt ſo ſoon that part beneath the Dock, where horſes commonly gall; again for the ſame inconveniency, people make uſe of a common invention, which is to ſow a candle in the Dock-peice of the Crupper, which by it's Sewet or greaſe that melts, ſoftens the Leather and helps to prevent the infirmity: I am of opinion, that it is fully as good to greaſe every day the Dock peice, and to waſh the ſore, if there be any, with good brandy, or Water and Salt, that ſo the galling which is beneath the Dock, and from which a man receives ſo much inconveniency in a journey, may be the ſooner heal'd up.</p>
                     <p>But if your horſe be ſo very ſeverely galled beneath the Saddle, that he cannot endure the Crupper, then you muſt have recourſe to a low Crupper, which is ſuch as does only preſs upon the lower parts of the Buttocks behind, and which certain Phyſicians make uſe of for their Mules, when they are Riding about the City to viſit their Patients.</p>

                     <p>If the Horſe which you are to Travel upon, be already fatigu'd, weary, and lean, then it will be ſo much the worſe, for Horſes are not very expenſive to be made lean, but are both chargeable, and require a great dale of pains to be recovered and made fat; therefore I would never begin a Journey, with a Horſe which were very much fatigued and low, untill I had firſt tryed to recover him, and if I found I could not ſucceed in it, then I would buy another.</p>
                     <p>Having obſerved this precaution, you are to begin with ſhort Marches or days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys at firſt ſetting out, and afterwards to increaſe them by degrees; As for example, the firſt day a man may make ſix French Leagues, the ſecond eight, and afterwards he may Ride Ten, or Twelve, and even Fourteen if there be need for it: But if it be in a Country where the Leagues are longer than about Paris, then four Leagues will be ſufficient for the firſt day, ſix for the ſecond, and ſo you may increaſe them to nine or ten, but if you are not much preſſed, it will be very fit, eſpecially to preſerve a great Equipage, to reſt the third or fourth day of your Journey; for the Horſes will recover Strength and vigour by that days reſt: and as people ſay that a Man muſt go back to take his Race, whereby he may leap the further, ſo the Horſes having with this little reſt recovered their heart and mettle, will perform their Journey the more pleaſantly; becauſe if a Man do not thus give them a little intermiſſion, he will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate to leave ſome Horſes by the way, or otherwayes render them unſerviceable; for any man may very well judge, that where there are a great number of Horſes, it will be very extraordinary if there be not ſome of them, which will not prove to be in a condition to hold out with a March, eſpecially when not accuſtomed to it.</p>
                     <p>All the time of your Journey, you ſhall ſuffer your horſe to drink of the firſt good Water you meet with, after ſix or ſeven a Clock in the Morning, if it be in the Summer time, and after eight or nine if in Winter; I call that good Water, which is neither too quick and peircing, nor too muddy and ſtinking, this I ſay your are to do unleſs you deſign to gallop him a long time after drinking, for in this caſe you are to forbear it, and although it be very much the cuſtom in England, to Run and gallop their Horſes after they have a drunk, yet I think that method capable to render Horſes purſy, as it is alſo, when they are rid in the mannage immediatly after they are watred; the Engliſh make uſe of this method of galloping their Horſes immediatly after drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they call <hi>Watering-Courſes,</hi> to bring them as they ſay in Wind, which is the moſt pernicious and hurtful practice for Horſes that a man can imagine, and they are ſo prepoſſeſſed and bewitcht with the fancy of it, even although the moſt part of their Horſes become Purſy by it, that it is not poſſible for a man to perſwade them that it is naught, and abſolutely ſpoileth them: The prejudice I find by this practice of theirs, is, that having put their Horſes in a fair way to become purſy, they ſell them to us in France for ſound ones, and then they become purſy among our hands, ſo that it is they who commit the folly, and we pay for it.</p>
                     <p>You are, while your Horſe is a watering, to interrupt his Drinking, or break his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as we ſay, by not letting him drink all at one draught, but you are to draw up his head five or ſix times during the time he is a Watering, and even although a Horſe be warm and ſweating very much, yet if he be not quite out of breath, and that he have as yet a pretty way to Ride before he arrive at the place you deſign to reſt and refreſh; for example a league or two, I aſſure you he will be the better that you let him drink a little, than if you ſhould ſuffer him to take none at all; it is indeed true, that if the Horſe be very warm and that you give him drink, you ſhould immediatly at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the water redouble your pace, or make him go at a gentle trot for ſome time, that ſo you may warm the water in his Belly which he hath drunk.</p>
                     <p>You are thus to let your horſe Drink all the while you are Travelling, becauſe if he be hot or ſweating when you come to Bait, you muſt let him ſtand a long time before you can give him any Drink, without endangering his Life, and alſo when you take the Bridle off him, his exceſſive Thirſt will hinder him to eat, ſo that an hour or two are elapſed before he offer to touch his Meat, which is almoſt all the time a man can well allow, for a twelve a clock's Baiting, and to depart again with the horſe in this condition before he hath either eat or drunk, will make him but very unfit to Travel; therefore common ſenſe and reaſon will decide in my favours, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179659:75"/>the ſureſt method is to let a horſe drink on the Road, and a little while before you arrive at the Inn, as I have already ordered.</p>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:179659:75"/>ſheltered walk, then you muſt cauſe put him in the Stable, becauſe the violent cold would if he were very warm deſtroy him, and all the motion he could make in walking although very well covered, would not be ſufficient to prevent his catching cold, or perhaps foundering; therefore you are in ſuch a caſe to ſtable him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, and to cauſe dry the ſweat off him with ſtraw, or with a Scraping-knife, if you can have one.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why a man ſhould not put horſes too ſoon in a ſtable, which are extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warm and out of breath, is, that the humours coming to chill on a ſuddain, and to congeal becauſe of the reſt which ſucceeds the preceeding violent motion, fall down upon the legs, or ſettle upon ſome other part of the body, and ſo either founder the horſe, cauſe him take the Vives, or take ſo great a ſquimiſhneſs and diſguſt, that he is of a great deal leſs value for a long time thereafter, which does not ſo frequently fall out, when by a gentle leading in ones hand at a ſlow walk, a man allows him time to cool by degrees, and to appeaſe the beating of his flank, which the exceſſive heat and fatigue have occaſioned; but when a man can do no better, let him be ſure to cauſe dry his horſe well and rub him exactly over the whole body; becauſe of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils the leaſt is ſtill to be choſen.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Coach horſes, which being very fat and Thick-Winded, or even Blowers, have in the great heats of Summer, their flanks ſo moved and agitated, that one would think they were ready to bruſt after they are put in the ſtable, although they have been led gently up and down for a pretty while in a mans hand, and as they are extremely fat or afraid of the exceſſive heat, they put themſelves ſo out of breath, that they ſometimes beat thus in the flank for an hour together, before they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Wind; now a man ſhould not be ſurprized at this, but immediatly order to walk them gently up and down for half an hour, and when they are unbridled, give them a little wet bran and a good deal of litter to ſtand upon, and ſo ſoon as they have piſſed, they will be very much eaſed, and ready to take journey again with the reſt; this inconveniency happens alſo to ſome, through weakneſs, and for not being able to reſiſt or draw againſt the horſes which are next to them, or rather always through too much fierceneſs, or drawing with too great violence, or otherwayes for fear of the great heat, which is many times ſeen to befall horſes which are very fat, Thick, heavy, and charged with fleſh, which although they may prove very good for the Streets, yet are not at all light enough for traveling in the Countrey.</p>
                     <p>When you arrive at your Inn, if your horſe be not very warm, and that you have only rid at his ordinary Train, you are to cauſe tye him up to the Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, and not to unbridle him untill he hath recovered his Wind, and be in ſome meaſure dry, unleſs that the Horſe be naturally inclined to ſweat much, or be of a waſhing conſtitution; and during that time you ſhall ungirt him, take off his Crupper, ſlack the Tie or Breaſt-plate, and put ſome freſh ſtraw betwixt the Saddle and Horſe's back to refreſh and eaſe him: Then ſhake down a good deal of freſh Litter beneath him, to oblige him to Stale or Piſs, for the moſt part of good Horſes do alwayes Piſs when they are firſt put in the Stable, and find the Litter beneath them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here by the way give you an advice, that will ſeem ſome what extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry although very good, which is, that during your whole journey you ſuffer your horſe to piſs as often as you find him inclin'd to it, and you ſhould alſo excite and invite him to it; the quite contrary of which is to be practiſed with Mares, which you are to hinder as much as poſſible to piſs in travelling betwixt meals, becauſe their ſtrength and vigour is thereby diminiſhed; thoſe who have Mares may make a tryal of this and will come to acknowledge it for a truth, that horſes ſhould be allowed, and even excited to piſs as they are riding, but Mares not, becauſe they will not be the worſe, but rather yield their Maſters the more ſervice by it; I don't alledge and recommend this practice without certainly knowing it's effect.</p>
                     <p>You are next to take away the old hay from the Rack, and clean the Stall before him, from all filthineſs of Earth, Sand, or Poultrey dung, taking alſo care that the Manger be not full of holes, which is very common in moſt Inns, that ſo the Oats which fall through may ſerve to feed their Fouls, and if it ſhould be very Dirty and Naſtie, you are then to cauſe waſh it with warm Water.</p>
                     <p>Another method for horſes which are full of fire and Mettal, and which are worth the pains to be carefully lookt after, is, that after you have rid them hard and arrived at the Inn, or that your horſe be very warm, you are immediatly at your alighting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179659:76"/>to cauſe unſaddle him, and ſcrape off the ſweat from his whole body with a Sweating, knife or Scraper, after which wipe his head and ears well with a Hair-cloath, and rub his body all over with freſh ſtraw, put a covering or horſe Cloath upon him, and then ſet on the Saddle again, after which cauſe gently lead him up and down in a mans hand, for half an hour before you put him in the Stable: This method is good to be practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as carry Grooms along with them, and whoſe only buſineſs it is to loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:179659:76"/>
                     <p>I knew an Italian <hi>Eſcuyer</hi> or Riding-Maſter, who after his Mannage, whether his horſes were warm or not, made them ſwim over and again a River near by his Mannage, as broad as the <hi>Seine</hi> is before the <hi>Louvre</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and afterwards cauſed dry them all over and cover them well in the ſtable, not ſuffering them to eat for an hour after; this he practiſed his whole life-time, and none of his horſes had ever either Collick or Vives, but were alwayes the cleaneſt and neareſt limbed could be; I beleive this Example although very true, won't perſwade any man to do the like.</p>
                     <p>Your horſe being tyed up to the Rack, and partly dryed of his ſweat or moiſture which he had at firſt arriving, although he be as yet bridled, yet if he begin to draw his hay, and beat no more in his Flanks, you are to cauſe unbridle him, and to waſh his Bit in a pail of water that it may be carefully hung up, after it is well cleaned and wipt, and afterwards you may ſuffer him to eat his hay at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who ſo ſoon as they arrive at the Inn, ſuffer their horſes to be unbridled by the Hoſtler boyes, as is the common cuſtom, are deceived, in ſo far as their horſes eat only for the firſt quarter of an hour, and then eat no more thereafter, whereas if they were ſuffered to ſtand ſome time in the bridle, it would be a great deal better for them, even although they ſhould receive no other advantage by it, but this, that they will eat with a great deal better appetite.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome may ſay, that horſes have been long enough bridled the whole day before, ſo that there is no need of letting them ſtand ſo long unneceſſarly in the ſtable without eating; To which I anſwer, that beſides what I have already ſaid, there are many Horſes to whom it is very fit to ſuffer the froth and foam to come in their mouths, by the aſſiſtance of the Bit, which obliges them to move their Tongues, and by this meanes they moyſten their mouths, which giveth them a better reliſh of what they eat, whereas if their mouths were not thus refreſhed, they would eat but a very ſhort while, ſo that a man thereby rather gains as loſſes any time, contrary to the common Maxim of the hoſtler-boyes: You are alſo to obſerve this by the way, that if your horſe hath been very Warm, and that you could not have the conveniencie to cauſe him drink upon the road, he will when unbridled eat but very little, although you have exactly obſerved all the directions I have been give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that becauſe he is much preſted and troubled with thirſt, therefore in that caſe you are to give him ſuch a quantity of Oats waſht in Ale or Beer, as you ſhall judge ſufficient, however leſs, if you intend to feed him again after he hath once drunk.</p>
                     <p>Many are of opinion, that people ſpoile their horſes by giving them Oats before their water; becauſe ſay they, the water maketh the Oats to paſs too ſoon, and ſo undigeſted out of the ſtomack; I again think that it is good to feed with Oats both before and after watering, although it be commonly the cuſtom not to do it till after; The Carriers and Coach-men upon their quick diſpatches give it alwayes after watering, neither is it without ſome appearance of Reaſon, that they thus feed with Oats only after watering, becauſe the water doth not remain ſo long in the ſtomack but quickly paſſes, ſo that the ſtomack is not at all weakned with it, and the Oats, which are of a porous and ſpongious body, retain abundance and as much of the moiſture of the water, as is ſufficient for the benefit of the horſe; this is the only Reaſon, why people feed with Oats only after watering, which however is not of force enough to hinder a man to feed Horſes before watering, which have been very warm and hard Rid, for they will be a great deal the better of it, and not at all in hazard of becoming ſick.</p>
                     <p>When people Travel in Flying-Coaches, or with laid or freſh horſes from ſtage to ſtage, and that they have driven very hard, when the horſes are taken all in a ſweat and out of breath from the Coach, they ſhould, as I have already ſaid, cauſe firſt ſcrape off their ſweat, rub them well down and cover them, and then cauſe walk them half an hour in peoples hands that they may recover their wind, during which time they ſhall prepare for each of them a French half Buſhel of wheat Bran, which is about ſix Engliſh quarts, and which muſt be well moiſtned with water, then having put them in the ſtable and unbridl'd them, lay it before them in the Manger, that ſo they may with it cool and refreſh their mouths which are dryed with the duſt and ſand, and which many times reacheth to their very Throats; now this wet Bran detatches or ſeparates the duſt from their mouths and Tongues, and even although horſes be a little warm, they very ſeldom receive prejudice by this method.</p>

                     <p>This duſt and and ſand, doth ſometimes ſo very much dry the tongues, palates, and throats of horſes, that they many times loſe their appetite by it, becauſe their tongues become hard and dry, eſpecially in horſes which ſuffer them while they are traveling in exceſſive hot weather, to hang out of their mouths; and therefore people ſhould never fail, either to give ſuch horſes alittle wet B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>People make uſe of the ſame method for hunters, and all other horſes which having Rid hard are out of breath; but eſpecially if they be very fat, the uſe of this we Bran doth exremelywell with them, and gaineth them time, becauſe uſeing it they may be the ſooner unbridled and in a condition to eat: In places where wheat Bran can be ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſoon as their horſes arrive whether they be warm or not, they give them drink with out apprehending any prejudice by it, as I have already obſerved was the cuſtome amongſt the Waggoneers, but then their waters in thoſe countreyes are not quick and ſharp, for becoming in a manner warm by ſtanding, they cannot therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> readily prejudge them; but when people attempt this method with horſes in France, they frequently dye before they can be accuſtomed to this ſo dangerous a habit of liveing, which I aſſure you ſhall never be put in practice by me.</p>
                     <p>People ſhould take exact notice to the water which horſes drink, eſpecially when traveling, for upon that, in a manner, dependeth their preſervation or deſtruction; that water which is leaſt quick or penetrating is the beſt; if you can have the conveniency of a River it is preferable to a Spring, and a Spring or Fountain to a Draw-well, but when a man is neceſſitate to let his horſes drink of ſuch penetrating waters, he ſhould cauſe bring it in a pretty time before he uſe it, ſet it in the Sun, or cauſe warm ſomed it to correct the ſharpneſs of the reſt; but it is ſooner done to throw amongſt it a little wheat Bran or ſome ſoft of bread crumbled; for want of both which, the crudity of the water may be a little corrected, by either ſtirring it ſome time about with your hand, or throwing a little Hay amongſt it; but if the water be extremely quick and peirceing, neither the ſtirring of it with your hand nor Hay will prevet the horſes taking the Vives, and therefore in that caſe you are either to mix with it a little warm water or wheat Bran, which will ſufficiently correct it.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happneth, that horſes are ſo hard and unmercifully rid, that they are burſt, and either dye or become foundered, if a man do not apply proper remedies to prevent it; for example people are at the Stagg-hunting and cannot have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of their laid or freſh horſes, becauſe the Stagg takes quite another way the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> on to the outmoſt extremity, ſo that if they be not well in wind, and accuſtomed to ſuch long Courſes, they are very quickly burſt; but notwithſtanding of this, good and keen hunters will rather venture the killing of their horſes by exceſſive Riding then fail to be up with the dogs; if therefore you have been obliged at hunting or otherwayes to make great diſpatch, with hazard of burſting your horſe, you ſhal when arriv'd, cauſe order him as I have already told you, by cauſing ſcrape off the ſweat, rubing him all over and cauſeing lead him in ones hand untill he cool <hi rend="margQuotes">then half an hour after you ſhall cauſe give him in an Engliſh quart of Claret wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The very ſame method may be obſerved for Coach-Horſes, which have been wrought and puſhed beyond their Wind and Strength; but then you muſt be careful not to give the ſtinking pills, or for want of them the Wine and Nutmegs, untill they have fully recovered their breath, that is to ſay, half an hour or three quarters at moſt after their arrival, to ſome more and to others leſs.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE generality of people who travel,<note place="margin">CHAP: XXXI That horſes at their firſt arrival should not have their legs rub'd down.</note> obſerve this method of cauſing rub down their Horſe's Legs with Straw, ſo ſoon as they are put in the Stable, and pretend thereby to unweary and ſupple their legs, and ſo very much refreſh them; but it is one of the greateſt abuſes can be committed, becauſe this action can produce no other effect, but to draw down upon the legs thoſe humours which are already ſtirred up by the fatigue of the Journey, for by Rubbing, the Nerves are heated, and conſequently their Pores opened, which maketh the Spirits exhale, and giveth an opportunity to the humours which have been already ſtirred up by the way, to diſcharge themſelves, and by their natural tendency to ſettle upon them, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs thoſe imperceptible paſſages, which were taken up with theſe Spirits, and thereby to occaſion obſtructions, which will deprive them of motion, and conſequently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horſes legs abſolutely ſtiff and unſerviceable; for the legs being thoſe parts of the body which are loweſt, are as it were it's ſink or conduit, eſpecially when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are drawn down upon them, by this Rubbing which is made with Straw, beſides that thoſe parts, being already fatigued, are the more diſpoſ'd to receive them: Now this humour, having once fallen down, does not again aſcend, and to reſolve and diſcuſs it, is difficult, becauſe the parts afflicted have not natural heat enough, and ſo the humour condenſes and ſpoils the horſe; and I admire that people never reflected upon this, until I firſt diſcovered it. But it may be objected againſt this, that the humour which falleth down is diſſipate by inſenſible tranſpiration, and through the Pores which are opened by this Rubbing of the Legs; to which I anſwer, that the humour indeed does in ſome meaſure rarify, but that it cannot be all diſcuſſed that way, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too groſs a body for it, ſo that the remaining part of the humour inſinuates it ſelf as a vapour amongſt the Nerves, which is afterwards by the cold condenſed into a water; and this water into a kind of viſcuous or glairous matter, which cannot be diſpelled by any Rubbing, becauſe, this Rubbing being practiſed in a time, when all the humours are in agitation, it draweth them down, and inſtead of giving eaſe, or being any ways beneficial to the horſe, is extremely prejudicial and hurtful.</p>
                     <p>This Rubbing of the Legs, which people practiſe at their firſt arrival, is the reaſon that their Horſe's Legs next day are ſtiff, and although they may not be ſenſible of, nor perceive it ſo ſoon, yet they cannot but in a very ſhort time come to diſcover it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will occaſion obſtructions in the Nerves, which ſtop the paſſages of the ſpirits that are the cauſe and fountain of motion, and which obſtructions will render the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Horſe's legs ſo difficult and troubleſome, that his whole ſtrength will not be ſufficient to make them ſerviceable as they ought, and ſo he will come to trip, ſtumble, and many times fall, ſo that by this method people take a great deal of pains to ruine and ſpoil their Horſes, by deſtroying their Legs: Thoſe who will not yeild to ſo palpable and convincing reaſons as theſe, let them make but a trial of it, and then certainly they will be perſwaded of it's truth, as ſeverals have already been, who no more order their horſes Legs to be Rub'd down at their firſt arrival, but only when they are altogether cool'd and pretty well reſted.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:179659:78"/>
                     <p>Now you ſhall prevent all theſe inconveniences, by practiſing this I adviſe you, which is to cauſe lead your horſe to a pond or waſhing place inſtead of rubbing him down, or for lack of this conveniency, cauſe waſh and bath his Legs at the Stable door, with a pail of cold water, that thereby you may prevent the deſcent of the moved humours, which is quite contrary to what is daily practiſed by the moſt part of people, who, it ſeems have never been at the pains, to reflect upon what I have been ſaying.</p>
                     <p>It is not that I diſapprove or diſcharge the Rubbing a horſe's legs; upon the contrary I very much approve of it, recommend it, and practiſe it my ſelf, but then it is only when they are pertectly cool'd, and that the humours, which the days travelling has ſtirred up, are ſetled, for example, if in the evening before you go to bed, you cauſe rub your horſes Legs for a full Hour, he will be refreſhed by it; or if in the Morning after your horſe is Curried and dreſt, you make your Groom divert himſelf with a good hard Hay-Wiſp ſo long as you ſhall judge it convenient, it will open the Pores, and make way for thoſe ſubtil humours, which have lately fallen down upon the Nerves, to reſolve, and being rarifyed by rubbing to evaporate, ſo that the legs are thereby rendered more ſupple, and you will produce by it a quite contrary effect to what it would have had, ſhould you have cauſed rub them at your firſt arrival.</p>
                     <p>But you may perhaps inſiſt and ſay, that all people, yea even thoſe who are moſt Skilful in horſes, do practiſe it; It is indeed true that many people do it, but the moſt skilful do it not: and if the reaſons I have given cannot ſatisfie you, I referre it to experience which is the Miſtreſs of Art; and finally, as I am not ſo much taken with my own opinion, as to oblige all people to yeild to it, ſo I conſent that you do not beleive me, but that for your fancy you ſpoil your horſe rather then ſubmit to reaſon.</p>

                        <p>In the Morning, before you ſaddle your horſe, you ſhould alwayes feel the Saddle-Bows to know if they be unglew'd or broke, then obſerve if the band of the ſaddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withers be unnail'd or ſplit, or the long bands any-wayes looſe or unfixed, if the Cloath of the Pannels be too ſtiff and hard, or that the pannels themſelves be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Bows; when a man hath had but never ſo little practice in this, he will run over all theſe particulars in the twinkle of an Eye, ſo that after he hath done it he may cauſe caſt the ſaddle upon his horſes back, which ſhould be alwayes done ſo ſoon as he is Curried and dreſt, and a pretty time before he take journey, becauſe commonly when horſes, which are a little aged, are once ſaddled, they make a great deal of more haſte and diſpatch in eating.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe, before bridling, a man ſhould look to thoſe Leathers in the head ſtall which ſupport the Bitt, to ſee that they be neither broke nor rotten; as alſo to the bridle reins where they are joyned to the Branches: Horſes ſhould alwayes be fed with Oats before parting, for he which hath an empty belly is not in a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to endure any great fatigue, becauſe as horſes are of a hot and dry conſtitution, if their natural heat find not ſomething whereupon to work, it feeds upon its own proper ſubſtance, which very quickly makes the horſe become lean, or at leaſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heats him very much inwardly.</p>
                        <p>There are many People, who are more curious in providing good chear for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than for their horſes, and who, if they have their own bellies full, don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or trouble themſelves much with any thing elſe; now ſuch perſons particularly, and many others unworthy to mount or ride a horſe, having read or heard read all the preceeding particulars, have ſaid, That to obſerve them exactly, a man needed noe other buſineſs, ſeing it would take up the moſt part of his time, and that for their own part they would rather venture the ſpoiling of their horſes, then be at ſo much care and trouble: I confeſs that it is not alwayes needfull to obſerve them all, but only the moſt neceſſar, and if you be once alittle accuſtomed to it, you will do all with a great deal of eaſe, and even almoſt without thinking on it; however I with all my heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that thoſe who will not obſerve them follow their own inclinations, becauſe I write only for ſuch as are well intentioned, and deſire to be inſtructed, and values very little what others ſhall either act or ſay againſt this ſubject: This is all that is to be obſerved before and in time of Travell; It now remains that I ſay ſomething of what is to be done after journeying, and when people are arrived from it.</p>

                           <hi>Sect:</hi> 2. <hi>Several other methods, whereby to unweary horſes, when they come first from Travel.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>YOw will extreamly unweary your horſe, if you charge his Legs with this compoſition following; take a pound of common ſalt, and putting it into a frying pan, fry it untill it be perfectly dry and leave crackling (for to have ſpoke according to the terms of Art I ſhould have ſaid <hi>Decrepitat</hi> ſalt,<note place="margin">Sect: 2.</note>) and when it hath thus left crackling, throw it ſcalding hot into a large Mortar, and beating it very fine add to it two pounds of honey, which you are to mix very well with it by the help of the Peſtle; with this, charge and rub his Legs, and although they be ſwelled it will reſolve and diſcuſs it, and take away the pain and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs of the finews, which the travelling may have occaſioned; this remedy is both eaſie and cheap.</p>
                        <p>The baths for the Legs, deſcrived in the 2d part, do wonderfully aſſwage their pain and lay their ſwelling; as alſo if you cauſe rub and chaff them well, with good brandy or ſpirit of Wine.</p>
                        <p>Or if you take two parts Brandy, and one part oyl of Walnuts, and mixing them well together chaff your horſes Legs with it, it is an excellent remedy, but I alwayes ſuppoſe that the Bleeding hath preceeded it.</p>
                        <p>To unweary your horſes at an eaſie rate, you may, after having bled him, Cauſe warm ſorne Claret Wine lees, untill it be throughly hot, then adding a pound or two of Honey, thicken the compoſition by degrees with good wheat flower, not forgetting to keep it alwayes ſtirring, untill it come to a pretty thick conſiſtence; then take it from the fire, and once in twenty four hours charge the horſes Legs with it, without removing any of what was put on before; this is an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and hath alwayes a very good effect.</p>
                        <p>The thickeſt of the dregs, or lees of the Claret-Wine made uſe of quite cold, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; you are to charge and rub the Legs with it, and frequently to renew its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; this remedy ſucceeds many times better then one more compoſed: If you add a third of Vinegar to two thirds of thick Wine lees, it will lay the ſwelling of a leg, and take away all the heat and fluxion, which may have fallen down upon it, by the fatigue of the journey.</p>
                        <p>Another eaſie enough remedy to unweary a horſe, without either much charges or multiplicity of ingredients, is vinegar and quenched Charcoals of Wood, which will diſſolve and diſſipate all the humours which are capable of reſolution, and which incommoded the leg by ſtifining its motion; I have already taught you how it ſhould be made.</p>
                        <p>But if your horſe be ſo very fatigued, that none of the abovementioned applications can recover him, then have recourſe to the 33 Chap: of the 2d part; where it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to the full of uſed and ſpoilt legs and of the meanes to recover them; and if all the remedies, which you have cauſed apply, produce noe good effect, my only advice then is, to give him reſt; for Nature many times of her own accord performs that, which all the remedies in the world cannot: However take alwayes care to cauſe rub his legs well, with a good Hay Wiſp, as alſo to Currie and dreſs the reſt of his body well, and perhaps the remedies which have not operate in the time of their application, will diſcover their effects afterwards, and that long reſt will at laſt perfect the Work.</p>
                        <p>At leaſt, you may cauſe once practiſe all the preceeding Remedies, with an aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that they cannot alter the Legs, even although they ſhould receive noe eaſe or benefit by them, which is a thing impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome remedies, which ſoften and mollify ſo extreamly the Sinews of the Legs, by reaſon of their great humidity and moiſtening quality, that they make a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179659:83"/>horſe Cripple and halt for a long time after their application, and although they have taken away the great pain, yet they make the Legs yeild and bend beneath the horſe becauſe of their having too much ſoftned the Nerves; ſo that there is almoſt as much time required to harden and ſtrengthen the Nerves again, as there was required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> better than it is, and if it be good may preſerve and keep it from becoming bad; The ſecond method is, that which diſguiſeth the foot, and maketh it appear good when really it is not, And this laſt is, that which is moſt ſought after by the Horſe Courſers; for albeit that this laſt method of ſhoing, through time, wholly ruines the foot, yet thoſe, who have no other deſign but to fell and put off their horſes, do not much trouble themſelves about it, for provided that their horſes feet but appear good, and they get them ſold, it is all they deſire.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſhow you the firſt method, which is to ſhoe a horſe for the advantage of his foot only, and although many run and ſeek earneſtly after the ſecond, that is, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the foot, and make it appear good, when really it is not; for by that method of ſhoeing, they will at laſt wholly ruine their horſes feet, and that is what I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to teach you; therefore to prevent your falling into this errour, you mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now this part is abſolutely neceſſar; and, for not underſtanding it, people of times ſuffer horſes of great value to become altogether uſeleſs, and ſo are neceſſitate to rely upon the diſcretion of a Smith-boy, who will cauſe you believe what he pleaſes, and perſwade you that he is doing very right, when perhaps he is abſolutely ruining your horſes feet.</p>
                     <p>Seing Shoeing is a Trade, which ſeemeth merely to rely upon practice, or rather a certain Rote which the Smith-boys learn from their Maſters, It followeth, that they not knowing the true Maxims, which ſhould be obſerved in ſhoeing a foot well, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot teach it their Apprentices; and when ſuch Boys come among able Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who would teach them to ſhoe for the profite of the foot, they give for a reaſon, that they were bred up in ſuch and ſuch a Shop, which was the beſt imployed in Paris, and that there, they did not ſhoe after that faſhion, yea their Opiniatrety for their rote is ſo great, that of times they render themſelves uncapable of being put in the right way: For me, I have applyed my ſelf to find out the true way of ſhoeing, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the need I had for it, to put and maintain bad feet in a condition to ſerve, as alſo that I might not have the trouble and diſpleaſure, of ſeing fine and vigorous horſes remain uſeleſs, for having been in the beginning badly ſhoed; ſo that a Man could not get them afterwards conveniently ſhoed, without cauſing them halt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall diſcourſe not only of Saddle, but alſo of Coach-horſes which require a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er care; becauſe in place of good feet, at leaſt ſuch as were indifferent, and in a condition to ſerve well when they came firſt from the low Countreys, if he be not a knowing Smith, they will in ſix Months or a year, have (<hi>les pieds Combles,</hi> as the French call them, or their Soles round and high) their heels narrow, or ſo low and ill ſhap't, that they will have difficulty to ſerve; becauſe in the time that ſuch horſe's feet alter or change, if the ſhoeing do not give them a good form and ſhape, I aſſure you they will ſoon be out of condition to ſerve.</p>
                     <p>I daily alſo, by reaſon of this ignorance, ſee feet hoof-bound, altered, and dry, and Legs which are arched (called in French <hi>Jambes arquée</hi>) alſo horſes which tread only upon the toes of their hind-feet, (called in French <hi>Chevaux rampins</hi>) and a hundred other accidents, which befall horſes by reaſon of their being badly ſhoed, and for not knowing how they ſhould be ſhoed, for the benefite and advantage of their feet.</p>
                     <p>There are four Maxims or chief Rules which muſt of neceſſity be known, that a man may ſhoe all ſorts of feet well.</p>
                     <p>The firſt comprehends this general precept: Toe before, and Quarter behind, or before behind, behind before, in French <hi>Pince devant, &amp; talon derrtere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Toe before, or <hi>Pince devant,</hi> that is to ſay, that although the Toes of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet be good and ſtrong, and ſo capable to ſuffer a good grip by the Nails you intend to drive in them, yet the quarters of the fore-feet hath leſs thickneſs of horn, and therefore people muſt take but a ſlender hold upon them, for fear of touching the quick, and ſo pricking the horſe; you muſt know then, that by <hi>Toe before</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that you may drive hardily, and give the Nails a good hold upon the Toes of the Fore feet, becauſe there the horn is very thick, which it is not in the quarters of the Fore-feet, for there the horn is thin, and you would be in hazard of pricking your horſe.</p>
                     <p>Quarter behind or <hi>Talon derriere,</hi> is that the horſe hath the quarters of his hind-feet ſtrong, that is to ſay the horn thick, and ſo capable of ſuffering a good grip, becauſe there is in that part much horn; but at the Toes of the Hind-feet, you will immediatly meet with the quick, becauſe the horn is but thin in that part, and therefore Smiths ſhould put no Nails at all juſt at the Toes of the Hind feet, but only in their quarters.</p>
                     <p>There are many Smiths in ſmall Villages, who find difficulty in following this Rule, and therefore unskilfully drive the Nails alike, in both the fore and hind feet.</p>
                     <p>To drive a Nail (in french <hi>Brocher un clou</hi>) is ſo to fix it in a horſe's foot, that it may keep faſt the ſhoe; the Hammer with which Smiths commonly knock in the Nails, is called the Driver, (in French <hi>Brochoir</hi>) from whence the French word <hi>(Brocher)</hi> is derived, is what I know not, neither is it of any conſequence, that it ſhould.</p>
                     <p>You are then, for the firſt Maxim, to recollect your ſelf and remember, That the quarters of the fore-feet are weak, and have but little horn, and that the Toes of the hind-feet are ſo likwayes, becauſe the horn is thin, and you will ſoon meet with the quick, ſo that by driving the Nails a little high in thoſe parts, you will eaſily cloſe or preſs a vein which ſurrounds the foot, and ſo cauſe the horſe halt, which is called Pricking of him, and if people do not very quickly find out the part hurt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179659:84"/>or prickt, matter will preſently form in it, and may be the occaſion of many trouble, ſome accidents; it is juſt ſo when people touch the quick; which is the fleſh that is betwixt the ſole and hoof, and which ſurrounds a little bone in the middle of the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, called the <hi>Little-foot,</hi> in french <hi>Le petit pied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>People prick horſes two ways, either when they drive into the quick, or when they preſs this vein, and it commonly falleth out in the quarters of the fore-feet, or in the Toes of the hind; I have given cures for it at full length in the 52 Chap. of the 2d part.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Maxim is, Never to open a horſes heels; it is the greateſt abuſe of all, and that which ruines the feet moſt: People call opening of the heels, when the Smith in pareing the foot, cutteth the heel low, and cloſs almoſt to the fruſh, and taketh it down within a finger breadth of the Coronet or top of the hoof, ſo that he ſeparates the quarters at the heel, and by that meanes weakneth and taketh away the ſubſtance of the foot, and maketh it to cloſe, and become narrow at the heels; now this which they call Opening, would be more properly called Cloſing of the heels, for the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and circumference of the foot being cut, by doing that which they call opening of the heels, which is to cut them wholly away, they are no longer ſupported by any thing, ſo that if there be any weakneſs in the foot it will of neceſſity cauſe it ſhrink and ſtraiten in the quarters, and if Smiths look't to their Reputation and did their duty, they ſhould make this Maxim one of their chief principles and Rules in ſhoeing.</p>
                     <p>The Third Maxim is, To make uſe of as thin and ſmall Nails as poſſible, becauſe they are the beſt; the Nailes that are thick and groſs make a large hole, not only when they are a driving, but alſo when they are riveting; for being ſtiff, they ſplit the horn and take it away with them, ſo that a horſe's foot falling between two ſtones, or in any other place, where it behooveth him to pull it out with force, the ſhoe will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt remain there with a part of the horn, to wit all that is below the Nails, This falleth out ſo much the more eaſily, becauſe the holes which the big Nails have made as well in driving as riveting, have already weakned, and as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the hoof quite round in the place where they are driven: Beſides that people cannot eaſily ſhoe a tender foot with ſuch big Niſs, without being in hazard of pricking it, eſpecially if there be but little horn to take hold of; but the ſmiths to prevent this, peirce their ſhoes <hi>lean</hi> or too near the edge, which through time is alſo the ruine of the foot.</p>
                     <p>The nails of <hi>Limoges</hi> and <hi>Argenton</hi> are preferable to others, thoſe of Limoges are ſoft and tough for no other reaſon, but becauſe they forge them with Char-coal made of the Cheſnut tree, which hath an oylineſs in it that mollifies the Iron, and maketh it ſuch as we approve of when we make uſe of thoſe Nails; for the Iron which they make uſe of at Limoges, is not better than in other places, it is only the Char-coal that maketh it good: And beſides, theſe Nalls are well forged and very thin, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are commonly long, if thoſe who drive them have not a ſure and ſteddy hand, or if the hoof be hard, they will be apt to bend and knee them every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ignorant ſmiths cry out extremely againſt theſe ſort of Nails, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not how to drive them, but thoſe who have a ſure ſtroke and can place them right, will almoſt never bend them, but drive them altogether as well, as thoſe big and ſhort clumſy Nails which are worth nothing.</p>
                     <p>But large heavy ſhoes, ſuch as Coach and Cart-horſes have, could not be kept faſt with ſuch ſmall and limber Nails as I adviſe you to make uſe of, becauſe there is a proportion to be obſerved in every thing; therefore I grant, that to large feet, you muſt make uſe of bigger Nails than to thoſe which are of a leſs ſize, but alwaye the ſmalleſt and Limbereſt Nails, that can be made uſe of to each kind are the beſt, neither doth this exception at all deſtroy our Maxim, which holds alwayes true, but more particulary for ſmall ſized horſes and tender feet.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Maxim is, To make the lighteſt ſhoes you can, conform to the foot and ſize of your horſe; becauſe, beſides that heavy ſhoes ſpoil the back ſinews and wearie the horſe, in traveling he hath almoſt alwayes his feet in the Air, for the time which they have to reſt upon the ground is not conſiderable, ſo that he muſt alwayes ſupport that uſeleſs weight, which being ſo heavy by reaſon of the great thickneſs of the ſhoes, maketh the Nails, with the leaſt knock againſt a ſtone, to ſlacken and yeeld; as alſo when a horſe Over-reaches, which is when with his hind feet he overtakes his fore, the ſhoes being heavy are more eaſily pulled off, ſo that the horſe remaining upon the Road unſhoed, is in hazard of being ſpoilt, before a man can have the occaſion of a ſmith to ſhoe him, and thoſe who think they uſe frugality by ſhoeing with thick and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179659:84"/>heavy ſhoes, and ſeldom, are deceived, for they loſs more by it than they gain; be cauſe by this method, horſes ſpoil their ſinews, and loſe more frequently their ſhoes than if they had been light; beſides that any ſhoes which are not brittle, laſt long enough in a plain Country where there are few ſtones.</p>

                     <p>I have told you what I think is neceſſary to be oſerved for ſhoeing in general,<note place="margin">CHAP: XXXVII How to pare the feet well, fit the ſhoes, and drive the Nails.</note> let us now conſider what is to be obſerved by the Smith when he is to pare the feet: he ſhould then by no meanes, leaſt he ſpoil them, hollow or empty their quarters with the Butteris, or pare doun the heels, which they call to open them; the Butteris is the inſtrument with which they pare the feet, and is alſo called the Pareing-Iron; if people ſhould hollow the quarters and open them, they would weaken the foot, for the roundneſs of the hoof being taken away, the heels are not ſuſtained or kept aſunder with any thing, and by conſequence will cloſe, being cloſed they will be extraordinarly weakned, and ſo the horſe will become very ſoon ſtrait heeled or hoof-bound, eſpecially if his heels be high and in the leaſt altered, that is dryed; you muſt then keep the heels of the fore-feet ſtrong, and likewiſe all the reſt of the foot; becauſe if your horſe ſhould chance to loſs a ſhoe upon the road, he will ſpoil his foot by the way, before you can perhaps have the opportunity to get him ſhoed again; alſo if you ſhould pare his feet thus almoſt to the quick, as ſome people do, who think thereby to prevent the ſo frequent ſhoeing of their horſes, becauſe their hoofs grow quickly, they would be all broken and ſpoilt; but if you know that your horſes hoofs are ſmooth and tough, you may by that judge that he will not ſo eaſily loſs his ſhoes, and therefore may, with the more confidence, pare his ſoles reaſonably near.</p>
                     <p>The foot being well pared, you muſt fit and adjuſt a ſhoe to it which muſt be half after the Engliſh faſhion, that is, which muſt be neither too broad nor too narrow in the web, neither muſt it's ſpunges extend any further than the heel, but muſt only follow the exact compaſs of the foot, juſt to the corners of the fruſh, and they muſt not appear much upon the outſides of the hoofs at the heels neither, as thoſe ſmiths, who pretend to be very underſtanding, would make us beleive, by ſaying that it preſerveth and ſupporteth the heel; for this pretended preſervation of the heel is but a fancy very ill grounded, therefore laying aſide ſuch whimſies, the middle of the ſpunge muſt, without any other Philoſophy, be placed juſt upon the middle of the end of the quarter which touches the corner of the fruſh, and is called the Heel, and which, it is to be ſuppoſed, you have not pared; for as I told you, the heels muſt never be pared, becauſe this paring of them, which by the common ſmiths is called the opening of the heels, ſhould as I ſaid, be rather termed the cloſeing as opening of them; Now the middle of the Spunges being placed upon the extremities of the quarters, which form the heel and toucheth almoſt the fruſh, muſt not reach any further, and then your horſe will be ſhod, both for his own eaſe and the benefit of his foot, for he will never become hoof-bound, neither will he over-reach, by reaſon of the Spunges of his fore-feet ſhoes being ſet equal with his heels, and not ſuffered to exceed them; the beſt and ſtrongeſt reaſon I can give for this, is that a horſe is never ſo much at his eaſe as when he is ſtanding without ſhoes upon his litter, therefore that he may have alwayes that eaſe, cauſe put ſhoes upon him which follow exactly the ſhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179659:85"/>heels, to preſerve them as ſome ſmiths ſay; for that is not to follow nature, which is our guide and wiſer than we, but is rather to croſs and conſtrain her; as for example.</p>
                     <p>Are not the <hi>Spantards</hi> more at eaſe in their ſhoes than we? becauſe their ſhoes follow the form and figure of their feet, and are made conform to the model thereof, where as the <hi>French</hi> cauſe make ſhoes, whoſe ſhape their feet muſt take and be accuſtome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>People make only uſe of the Butteris, for to give the ſhoe a ſeat after they have cut the Toe with the Cutting-knife, for Examp: the breadth of ones finger or thumb, if the foot be too long at the Toe; in which caſe you muſt alſo cauſe pierce the ſhoe near the edge at the Toe, for fear of pricking, and ſo placeing the ſhoe after that faſhion, you will force the too great nouriſhment which went to the Toe, to ſtrengthen the heels, and in twice or thrice ſhoeing, the foot will come to take a good ſhape and form,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:179659:86"/>and alſo in the time that you reſtrain the Toe by cutting it, the heel will ſtrengthen. Now theſe kind of feet growing only at the toe, all the nouriſhment of the foot goeth there, and ſo the heel becometh alwayes narrower, and daily weaker; but if you obſerve that which I tell you, to cut the toe with the Cutting-knife, having only as it were Blanched or cleaned the ſole with the Butteris, and that you put the ſhoe at the Toe a finger breadth or ane inch back, according as the toe is too much ſprung, and that afterwards you cut away the horn, I aſſure you the foot will take quite another form or ſhape, which will be a great deal better, and the heels will alſo ſtrengthen.</p>
                     <p>But if your horſe's heels be low and not narrow, and that the Fruſh be large or fat, with great difficulty will you keep it from touching the ground, and then your horſe will be in danger of halting, eſpecially when he is riding upon hard ground.</p>
                     <p>To prevent it, I think there is no other remedy than to give him Calkins, after the Faſhion of the point of a Hares eare, (in French <hi>en Oreilles de Lievre,</hi>) which is do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But firſt, to barr the paſtern Veins right, you muſt only tye them near the joynt with a fine threed, to the end that you retard not their cure; a little ſilk is very good for that purpoſe; then cut the Vein beneath and let it blood; if it blood too long, you may bind up the Orifice with a large band and a Compreſſe.</p>
                     <p>If for Flat-feet you cauſe barr the Veins, you will come ſooner to your purpoſe than if you had omitted it; but that doth not hinder this following method to be very good, although you ſhould not have barred him.</p>

                     <p>If the horſe's ſole be round and lower than his hoof, which happeneth more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179659:87"/>without hollowing or vaulting their ſhoes which will make them go uneaſily, and alſo through time cauſe their feet at the ſoles to become round, like the ſegment of a Ball, which is what in french is called <hi>Des pieds Combles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſhorteſt and beſt remedy for ſuch feet is, to barr the Paſtern veins, and ſeven or eight days after the operation, to cauſe make him Panton ſhoes with ſtrait ſpunges, and extraordinarly thick on the inner edge; they muſt alſo be altogether flat and not vaulted, for it is to be remarked, that almoſt all the round or high ſoled horſe's have narrow heels near the ſhoe, and the Smiths thinking to make them go eaſily, make them hollow ſhoes which reſt only upon the horn in the outſide of the heel, and by that means, becauſe the ſhoes by degrees conſtraine the foot, they make it grow daily ſtraiter at the heel; the little bone alſo which is in the middle of the Coffin preſſes downwards towards the ſole, the Toe grows long, and ſo the feet become ill ſhaped and unſerviceable; now to help and rectify all theſe inconveniences, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhoe being forged and peirced near the edge of the Toe, as I told you, you shall Cut more or leſs from the horſe's Toe with the Cutting-knife, as you shall think fit; then fit the shoe ſo, that the ſlopings or thick parts of its ſpunges may enter within the corners of the Frush, and being flat at the Toe that it may reſt upon the horn, but although it reſt alſo a little upon the ſole it matters not, and faſten it with thin nails; alſo put into his foot a reſtrictive made of Chimney Soot and Turpentine boyled together, and anoint his hoof with hoof ſalve, then let his feet ſtrengthen and be eaſed of the pain, which that new manner of shoeing will occaſion, and that for the ſpace of twelve days or more untill he leave halting, afterwards cauſe him work by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and after three or four shoeings, if the horſe be not old, his foot will have taken a good shape: This which I ſpeak is not by ſpeculation, but founded upon a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny experiences.</p>
                     <p>It is a great abuſe to vault ſhoes when People may forbear it (and it may for the moſt part be omitted) becauſe the foot being nailed and made faſt to the ſhoe, it groweth and taketh the ſhape or form of the ſhoe, and nature finding that paſſage open, through the inclination which ſhe hath to furniſh a ſuperfluous nomiſhment to the under part of the ſole, preſſeth alwayes that way, and is alſo helped by the hollow ſhoe, to give that round form to the feet, which rendereth a horſe unſerviceable for the ſtreet or upon hardground; ſo that people are neceſſitate to ſend them to draw the plough, which had they wanted that fault, would have been good, and might have ſerved for a Coach.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth alſo that when a horſe travelleth upon vaulted ſhoes, he treadeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the middle of the ſhoe, for it cannot all equally touch the ground, becauſe of its roundneſs; ſo that it hindreth the horſe to goe ſo firmly as otherwayes he would, and alſo maketh him ſlip.</p>
                     <p>The ſureſt way therefore, is to rectifie ſuch bad feet in the beginning, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time when horſes alter or change their horn, which is the firſt ſix Months after they come from Flanders.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing that your horſe's feet be yet in a condition to be helped, you muſt reſtrain their growth in the ſoles as I have ſhown you for the flat feet; or if his heels be narrow, ſhoe him with a Panton ſhoe, and after the former fashion without vaulting or hollowing it, you muſt alſo but pare little from his feet, and leave his ſole ſtrong, shorten his foot at the Toe, and put theſe panton shoes upon him; If his heels I ſay be narrow near to the shoe: Then put the reſtrictive into his foot which I ordered before, or otherwayes let him ſtand with his feet being shoed after the fashion I have been showing you, in his own dung being kept a little moiſt that it may not heat, and let him ſtand ſo until he halt no more, alwayes keeping the dung moiſt upon which he ſtandeth; at the ſame time put about his foot a Charge or Softner reaſonably warm, or hoof ſalve as I have before ordered you: You muſt alſo renew two or three times the application of the reſtrictive, and the Charge or hoof-ſalve, keeping him alwayes shoed after the former manner, but if his foot after shoeing be very high and round ſoled, you muſt then let him ſtand eight or ten dayes upon his Litter.</p>
                     <p>If the horſe have his ſole but a little raiſed, or that it be not as yet abſolutely round beneath, after twice or thrice shoeing it will be helped, but the more it is out of shape the more time will it take to rectifie it: It is to be obſerved that flat feet, at leaſt the moſt part of them, have their heels narrow near the shoe, ſo that the ſmiths hollowing or vaulting very much their shoes, make them reſt upon the outſides of the heels, and by that meanes make them become narrower; now quite contrary to this method, you muſt cauſe shoe your horſes with panton shoes, ſo that cauſing their heels

                     <p>To prevent and put a ſtop to this infirmity, you muſt when you ſhoe ſuch horſes take the heels very much down without hollowing the Quarters, and pare the Fruſt flat, for all horſes whoſe heels are very much taken down, will not only never become hoof-bound, but alſo they will have no <hi>Bleymes</hi> (which is an inflammation occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by bruiſed blood within the hoof, betwixt the Sole and the little-foot near to the heel, where the matter gathereth and cauſeth the diſorders which are explained in the 54 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2d. <hi>part</hi>) and alſo the Sinews of their legs will be preſerved, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be horſes which work in the Mannage upon ſoft ground.</p>

See plate 2d. Figure 11th. and the heels very far from ſtraitning, will infallibly open and enlarge.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe horſes which are hoof-bound, after that you have cauſed pare their feet, and left the Sole extraordinarly ſtrong at the heels, you muſt have Panton ſhoes, conform to the ſhape of the 10. Fig. in Plate 3d. which are (as I believe) <hi>Monſieur de is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179659:89"/>Browe's</hi> invention, who was one of the moſt skilful horſemen we had in France, when the Exerciſe of Riding was firſt there eſtabliſhed, as people may judge by the book he left us, of the manner how to mannage horſes, and by the favourable character hath been left of him to poſterity.</p>
                     <p>I have called this ſhoe the <hi>Panton</hi> or <hi>Pantable-ſhoe,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from theſe of any other faſhion or shape.</p>
                     <p>Now to forge a <hi>Panton-ſhoe,</hi> you muſt make the inner edge of the ſpunge B, A, E, C, D, F, a great deal thicker than the outer edge IE, LF, ſo that betwixt A G, and D H, there may be two or three times the thickneſs that there is betwixt I E and L F, as you may perceive by the thickneſs of the ſpunge A B, C D, ſo that the shoe riſes by degrees from G to A and ſloppeth equally from A to E, the whole length A G, E I; and ſo you will find that the inner edge of the ſpunge is a great deal thicker than the outer, for the thickneſs within marked A B, is three times thicker then E; it is the inſide of the ſhoe, and that which toucheth the ſole which you ſee in the figure, but there muſt be great care taken that the foreſaid thickneſs A B, C D, of the ſpunge, diminiſh alwayes towards G H, as you may perceive in the Figure, and all the reſt of the ſhoe from I L, G H, round the Toe of the ſhoe, is quite flat as other ſhoes are, to the end that the horſe's foot may reſt upon it at eaſe: That which is repreſented to you by the Figure, is but the inſide of the ſhoe next the horſe's foot, and the ſpunges ſhould be ſtrait, or pretty near other, that they may reſt upon the inſide of the Corners of the fruſh, and all the outſide of the ſhoe, which is next the ground, muſt be quite flar like to another ſhoe, and then you ſhall have a right Panton ſhoe for your horſe; <hi>See plate</hi> 3d. <hi>Fig:</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary when you place the ſpunges of this ſhoe upon the end of the heel, which is the extremity of the Quarter, that the ſaid extremity of the quarter reſt upon the middle betwixt AE, DF, which is the ſloping part of the ſpunge; but for all that, the inner edge of the Quarter AG, muſt not reſt wholly upon the ſole, although you kept it ſtrong enough, which ſhould be always done when you make uſe of thoſe kind of ſhoes, for although people ſhould prevent as much as poſſible any ſhoes reſting too much upon the ſole, yet people are ſometimes neceſſitate to ſuffer this faſhion of ſhoes to reſt a little upon the heels, and even the inner edge of the Spunge almoſt alwayes toucheth the Fruſh; Therefore the ſole ſhould be alwayes kept ſtrong, eſpecially at the heels; afterwards anoint your horſes feet, which are ſhoed after this faſhion, with the hoof ſalve before mentioned, or thoſe deſcribed in the 47 Chap: of the 2d. part, and keep his fore-feet amongſt his moiſtned dung: If you continue this method, infallibly his heels will open and enlarge; the horſe at firſt if you have weakned his ſoles too much, may mean his feet with theſe kind of ſhoes, but his fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The reaſon why the uſe of theſe kind of ſhoes openeth the heels, and helpeth hoof-binding, is that when the heel groweth it is forced outwards by the ſhoe, becauſe the Spunge, which is thicker a great deal in the inner edge then in the outer, hindereth the heel to cloſe and tend that way, and upon the contrary forceth it outwards, ſo that either the hoof muſt not grow, or of neceſſity the heels muſt enlarge and open, if the ſhoes be right placed.</p>
                     <p>You muſt continue the ſhoeing of him after this faſhion, until his heels be well ſhaped and large, which will be infallibly after twice or thrice ſhoeing; do it at the Change, or about the fourth or fift day of the new Moon: the uſe of theſe shoes is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, in that they never shift upon the feet, but remain firm in one place, being kept fixed by the thickneſs of the inner edges of the Spunges.</p>
                     <p>A horſe shoed after this faſhion, is many times unſerviceable for a little time, which muſt be allowed him to ſtrengthen his feet, amongſt his moiſtned dung.</p>
                     <p>People muſt not think to travel with theſe kind of ſhoes, at the beginning when

                     <p>FOR horſes which have cloven or falſe Quarters,<note place="margin">CHAP: XLI How horſes which have cloven or falſe Quarters are to be shoed.</note> you muſt cauſe make a ſhoes after the faſhion which I call the Half-panton ſhoe, the uſe of it being good, I therefore thought fit to propoſe it to you; this method of ſhoeing may alſo ſerve for horſes whoſe hoofs begin to cloſe and ſtraiten at the heels, for it cometh near to the figure of the panton ſhoe, becauſe the Branch is turned upwards, which maketh the ſame ſloap that the Panton ſhoe doeth, but the ſide of the ſhoe next to the ground is not the ſame, becauſe there is but one edge of the Spunge, to wit the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt edge, which toucheth the ground, whereas the under ſide of the Panton ſhoe is quite flat: theſe kind of Half-panton ſhoes do not force out the heels ſo ſuddenly as the whole Panton ſhoes, and therefore are good to be made uſe of at firſt, to cauſe the heel ſpread.</p>
                     <p>The ſhoe EF, GH, which is repreſented <hi>in the</hi> 11. <hi>Fig. of the</hi> 3 <hi>plate,</hi> is a half Panton ſhoe, which is to be put upon a horſe which hath one or more falſe quarters, and which conſequently hath narrow heels; you muſt cauſe then make, eſpecially the whole branches and alſo the Spunges FB, DH, ſtronger than ordinary, afterwards turn them up ſo, that AB, CD, may be higher than the outer edge EF, GH, ſo you will find that betwixt AB, and EF, the ſhoe will ſloap outwards, alſo the other branch CD, GH, will doe the ſame; and the reſt of the ſhoe FEGH, will be altogether flat upon the ground as an ordinary ſhoe, for I here repreſent to you the inner ſide of the ſhoe, becauſe the under ſide of the ſame ſhoe FEGH, muſt reſt upon the ground the whole compaſs of the ſhoe FEGH; Now in vaulted ſhoes the Spunges are turned quite contrary, for in them they are turned outwards towards the ground, whereas in theſe they are turned in to the foot.</p>
                     <p>The ſhoes for hoof-binding before mentioned, have the inner edge of the Spunges a good deal thicker than the outer, whereas theſe have both the edges of equal thickneſs; but the dexterity is to turn the Spunges, for to give them a right ſloap, and make the ſhoe hollow or vaulted next the ground.</p>
                     <p>To ſet on and fit the half Panton ſhoe, you muſt, when you pare the foot, keep the ſole ſtrong at the heels, and ſo fit the ſhoe, that the middle of the heel which maketh the extremity of the Quarters, may be ſet juſt upon the Spunges F B, D H; alwayes taking care that the inner edges of the ſaid ſpunges reſt not wholly upon the ſoles, but although they reſt a little upon them it matters not; then drive your nails neatly, and ſee that they be very thin in the ſhank.</p>

                        <hi rend="margQuotes">When the ſhoe is put on to remain, that is to ſay, when it is nailed and rivetted, you muſt pour into his foot Tallow and Pitch molten together, with hurds and ſplinters of wood above them to keep all faſt,</hi> and if you have the Oyl of Bays, it will be very

                     <p>There are ſome horſes, eſpecially your light kind of horſes, which have unequal heels, in ſo far as the one ſtandeth higher than the other, which is eaſily perceived by looking to the heels, juſt at the Paſtern; there is no other help for them, but to make uſe of this way of ſhoeing with the half panton-ſhoe, or to take out their ſoles and cleave the Fruſh to the very bottom; that ſo, when it groweth up again, you may keep the heels at an equal height.</p>
                     <p>When horſes, which are appointed to ride in a Mannage their whole Life-time, or thoſe which ride alwayes upon ſoft ground, have Falſe-quarters; according to the old cuſtom, people cut ſhort and retrench the quarter of the ſhoe, to the firſt nail hole from the ſpunge: but it is not poſſible, to cauſe a horſe ſhoed after that faſhion travel in the Countrey, nor even along the ſtreets, if but a little from the Mannage.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, for horſes of mannage which are hoof-bound, people cauſe ſhoe them with <hi>Lunette</hi> ſhoes (as the french call them) which are as it were half ſhoes, becauſe their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are retrenched to the firſt nail hole from the ſpunges, which is alſo an old cuſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>There is another reaſon, why that in plain Countreys as well as Hilly, people make theſe kind of ſhoes exceed ſo far the Mules Toes, and that is, becauſe they have very high heels and but weak enough feet, ſo that people dare not pare then down; becauſe, in them conſiſteth the whole ſtrength of their feet; the heels therefore remaining very high, if they were not ſhoed after this faſhion, they would have their paſterns caſt forwards in four days time, and their high heels would make their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>People make the like operation upon horſes which have their paſterns altogether caſt forwards, by cutting them four fingers breadth higher than the knee, juſt upon the fore part of the fore-thigh; they firſt cut the skin above the ſinew which is very ſtiff and ſtretched upon the fore part of the leg, then they raiſe the ſinew with a <hi>Shamoys</hi> or wild goats horn, by putting it quite beneath the ſinew; afterwards they cut the ſinew with the Inciſion-knife, quite throw to the <hi>Shamoy</hi> horn, they fill the wound with ſalt, and put hurds or courſe flax, dipt into warm Turpentine above it, and they hinder the horſe to come at it with his Teeth; for to keep the apparel faſt-they wrap the part about with a cloath, which muſt be ſewed for fear of preſſing the horſe's leg too hard which would cauſe it ſwell, then they leave him in that manner and dreſs him not for ſome dayes, but they blood him the very next and anoint his whole leg with the Dukes ointment deſcribed in the 2d. part <hi>Chap:</hi> 34. <hi>Sect:</hi> 9. and continue it every day for eight dayes; the horſe, during that time, may be walked up and down in ones hand, and the paſtern will fall into it's place ſo ſoon as ever the wound is healed up; this operation is more difficult than the former, and ſucceeds well enough with horſes which are altogether <hi>Boulettez,</hi> that is to ſay, which have their Paſtern caſt very far forwards, and as it were quite out of its place, which maketh the Sinew ſo ſtretched, that it is quite raiſed from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thigh and very much advanced, yet it is done without trouble and hazard; but if a horſe be but in a ſtreight line from his knee to the Coronet, and that the ſinew, we have been diſcourſing of, be not much raiſed from the bone and exceſſively ſtretched, it might in that caſe do prejudice, as I ſaw it do to a horſe, which had one of his legs from the knee to the Coronet, only in a ſtreight line, and in the other the Paſtern was caſt quite forwards; the leg in which the Paſtern-joynt was quite caſt forwards, the operation ſucceeded admirably well with it, for the ſinew was very much detached and elevate, but for his leg which was only in a ſtreight line from the knee to the Coronet, the ſinew was not altogether raiſed from the thigh, and ſo the horſe was two Months of recovering.</p>
                     <p>Now people run not that hazard in making the other operation, which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four fingers breadth below the fore-thigh vein, for it can never do any prejudice although the ſinew be but verie little raiſed and advanced; therefore except a horſe have his Paſtern-joint quite <hi>Bouletté</hi> or caſt forwards, I would not adviſe you to cut the ſinew a little above the knee: This is enough upon this Subject.</p>

                     <p>People ſhould never pare a horſe much at the Toe that is foundered in the feet, becauſe the ſole in that part ſhould be alwayes kept ſtrong, to the end that if there be any appearance of a Creſcent, it may be prevented from coming any greater length, and ſo may be taken away by nature, which will not I aſſure you be done in a ſudden; and alſo you muſt not take down his heels much, for all the ſtrength of theſe kind of feet lyeth in the heels, and ſo ſoon as the horſe is ſhoed, pour into his ſole of the Oyl of Bays without any mixture, ſcalding hot, with hards or courſe flax above it, and ſplinters of wood to keep all faſt, and continue it for ſeven or eight times, once every other day, to pour the foreſaid Oyl into his Feet.</p>
                     <p>Horſes, which have great founderings fallen down in their feet, ſhould never be longer of having their ſoles taken out, than three Months at moſt after their founder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when People have out their ſoles, the whole Creſcent ſhould be fired, that is to ſay, burn the whole end of the bone of the Little-foot which is looſe, that ſo it may fall away; but I think it by far more proper not to take out ſuch horſes ſoles at all, but to keep the Sole alwayes ſtrong, and to pour into it the Oyl of Laurel or Bays; be careful alſo to buy the true Oyl of Bays, for that which People ſell commonly, in moſt ſhops in Paris, is worth nothing.</p>

                     <p>THere are many Towns, both in France and England,<note place="margin">CHAP. XLVI Of Calkins,</note> where the ſtreets are ſo uneven, that none of the horſes which draw in them can keep their Feet from ſlipping, without being Calked; in Germany, all the Horſes are calk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well in the Countrey as in the Towns, without ſo much as excepting the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage horſes: A German would not ſuffer a horſe, in his ſtable, without being Calked, whereas upon the contrary, a French man would not ſuffer one in his that were ſo.</p>
                     <p>If you are neceſſitate, through the unevenneſs of the ſtreets, or becauſe of ſome other motive, to calk your horſes, as I ſhew'd you when I ſpoke of low heel'd horſes; you muſt, for to make the Calkin, turn down the inner corners of the Spunge upon the corner of the Stithy or Anvill, and ſo faſhion a Calkin after the ſhape of the point of a hares ear, in French <hi>en Orielle de lievre,</hi> the great ſquare Calkins ſpoil a Foot ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and occaſion <hi>Bleymes,</hi> as the French call them (which is an inflammation occaſioned by a corrupt or bruiſed Blood within the Sole at the Quarters, whereof we ſhall treat in the 54 <hi>Chap, of the</hi> 2d <hi>part</hi>) whereas theſe after the faſhion of the point of a Hares ear, do little prejudice, if people take but the paines to pare the horn a little low at the heel: The uſe of theſe kind of Calkins is tollerable, when there is a neceſſity for having any, becauſe of two evils the leaſt is ſtill to be choſen.</p>
                     <p>This opinion, it's true, appeareth ſomewhat problematical, although really it be not; for thoſe who approve of Calkins ſay, that when a horſe is travelling upon a way which is but a little ſlippery, ſuch as thoſe high-wayes which are fat and full of Clay, or that it hath been but a little rain, he fretteth and fatigueth himſelf extremely, to prevent his ſlipping, when he is ſhoed ſmooth or without Calkins; and that ſuch horſes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their vigour to that purpoſe, and alſo that a horſe which will not at all ſweat in his ordinary travelling, yet let people but ſtep him as ſoftly as poſſible upon a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery high-way in the ſummer time, and he will ſweat more in riding one hour if he

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179659:95"/>means they pretend to hinder any thing to peirce their horſes ſoles: Some Hunters make very much uſe of this method, which is not bad for ſome kind of horſes, but it may very readily occaſion <hi>Bleymes,</hi> which people find of times more difficult to cure than a prick cauſed by a ſtub; and when people alſo ſuffer a horſe's feet to grow too much and too long, they often trouble him and make him trip eaſily; However if people have a mind for it, they may make tryal of this method.</p>
                     <p>People make not Planch-ſhoes for Coach-horſes as they do for Mules, becauſe the Planch-ſhoe is a ſhoe altogether cloſs, which hath but an open in the middle of the ſole, about the bigneſs of a Crown-peice; with Planch-ſhoes people might prevent a great many pricks with Street-nails, by which ſo many horſes are daily loſt; but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and Mules is conſiderable, in ſo far as the greateſt ſtrength of Mules feet lyeth in their heels, whereas in horſes it is in their Toes (ſpeaking of the fore-feet) ſo that people cannot keep a horſe's heels ſo high as they may do a Mule's; beſides that people leave a little open or paſſage for the Mules, betwixt the ſhoe and the ſole, at the Toe of their fore-feet, through which the water may run (in French <hi>un Siflet</hi>) which cannot be done to horſes, becauſe the whole ſtrength of their foot would be taken away with it, ſeeing it lyeth only in the Toe and not in the heel, which is juſt contrary to Mules; The chief reaſon why people make not Coach-horſes ſhoes quite cloſs, is becauſe horſes feet are more moiſt than Mules are, ſo that if they had not air, they would in the Winter time rot, becauſe of too much moiſture, and in the ſummer time become too dry or hard, being quite covered and altogether without Air.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, the Flanch-ſhoe indeed preſerveth the foot, but it ſpoileth and ruineth the leg, and the ſhoes <hi>à la Florentine</hi> or welted ſhoes, preſerve the leg and ſpoil the foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let this be ſaid by the bye, upon this occaſion of diſcourſing of Mules.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh ſhoes are light, and excellent for horſes which have weak feet, but they eaſily break upon the Streets, and in ſtonny Countreys the flinty ſtones ſpoil a horſe's Sole, and occaſion Bruiſes; indeed the <hi>Adroit</hi> Engliſh Smiths forge a light ſhoe to admiration, there can be nothing wrought better, and more equally, and they make them extraordinary good, becauſe their Iron is better than ours; In their Countrey where the ground is ſoft and without ſtones, thoſe narrow webbed ſhoes are good, but in this Countrey they would not do well at all. An expert Engliſh Smith holdeth the horſe's foot himſelf, pareth it, fitteth the ſhoe and driveth the nails, without the help of any; he holdeth the horſe's foot betwixt his knees, and taketh off his ſhoe and putteth it on again all alone: this is a thing, which none who have ever been in England, can be ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>The Turks excell all Nations in the World for ſhoeing; they beat and forge their ſhoes without any open, and almoſt cold as people do Silver; a horſe's four ſhoes will not weigh more than one of ours, and they will laſt almoſt as long: But the Iron which they make uſe of, and their Countrey which is ſoft and free of Stones, contribute much to this.</p>

                     <p>Horſes, which have tender and delicate Feet, and that unluckily come to looſe their ſhoes upon the Road or Fields, where they are far from any Smith, run the hazard of ſpoyling and looſing their Feet; you are therefore in that caſe, to wrap a piece of an old hat about your horſe's Foot, and to lead him in your hand, until you find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity again to ſhoe him.</p>
                     <p>There is an invention of ſhoes, that may be accomodate to all ſizes of Feet, and which are made faſt without Nails, only by the aſſiſtance of a raiſed border, which binds and environes the horn quite round the Foot, then it is made faſt with a Vice, which ſo ſcrews it together, that the foot is encloſed within it as in a Box; theſe ſhoes are of no uſe neither for the Countrey nor Streets, and the <hi>Sieur Frederick Griſon,</hi> hath given the deſign of them in his Book of Horſemanſhip, although very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and where there are a great many things, both to be rectified and added.</p>
                     <p>A Countrey Gentleman, obſerving that his horſe had loſt a ſhoe, pulled off one of his Boots and put his horſe's Leg in it, leaſt he ſhould have ſpoylt his Foot, and thus made his Entry into a great Town. I ſaw once a horſe, in one of the beſt Academies in France, that rode in Leather ſhoes, becauſe his hoofs were not ſtrong enough to carry thoſe of Iron. The French have neglected to treat of this ſubject, which is not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be undervalued; the Italians have writ very learn'dly of it, and if you are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, you may enquire for a Book intituled. <hi>Il Trattato, del Ferrares Cavalli con i ferri in deſſegno di Caeſaré Fiaſchi nobile Ferrare ſe,</hi> but in my opinion he ſayes both too much and too little: I am therefore hopefull, that the little I have ſaid upon this ſubject, will be ſufficient for your uſe, eſpecially if you take the pains to read it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the different methods; for there are many People, who would with all their heart know and underſtand things, but few who will give themſelves the trouble to learn them.</p>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Hay will either make him Purſy, or alter his flank.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:179659:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>There are ſome Gurmandizing or greedy-eating-horſes, which all day long eat their litter, which is the ſtraw that is thrown beneath them to ſtand upon; a man ſhould abſolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>ſecond Maxim</hi> is, That for every horſe which is fat and reſting at home, that is, which either works and travels not at all, or but very little, new threſhed wheat ſtraw is better for him than hay, becauſe his wind is better preſerved by it, it alters not his flank, and alſo the fat and fleſh which it produceth is alwayes more firm then that of hay, as likewiſe, as people ſay, more dureable, conforme to the French proverb; <hi>Cheval de paille, Cheval de bataille,</hi> Which I Engliſh thus.</p>

                     <p>But ſome perſons who have only one horſe, will perhaps ſay that they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his reſting ſo much, and remaining ſo long in the ſtable without doeing any thing, but if he be hurt or become lame they will be neceſſitate to do it, and thoſe who have great ſtables of horſes, know very well that when they have been much travelled, eſpecialy at the cloſe of a Campaigne where they have been extremely fatigued, there is a neceſſity to give them reſt, and that for a conſiderable time, that ſo they may recover.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are Light-bellyed, and have not their flanks altered, agree better with the eating of Hay than ſtraw, alſo they are excepted out of the proceeding Rule, becauſe the hay cauſe; them to drink luſtily, and the abundance of water tempers and qualifies that heat, which dryed them up and hindered them to take a Belly; yet Hay conſidered as Hay, would ſeem more fit and proper to take away a horſe's Belly than give him one, becauſe by its naturall heat, it ſhould do him more prejudice than ſtraw which is not ſo fiery, but as it obliges horſes to drink much, by reaſon of it's being charged with a nitrous Salt which provokes thirſt, the quantity of drink extinguiſhes it's fiery and heating quality, how great ſoever, and ſo the horſe, which is no more conſumed by that fire which contracted his Belly, is put in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have it enlarged; therefore a man ſhould make no difficulty to give hay to ſuch kind of horſes, and every lean horſe which eateth heartily, and drinketh luſtily, and proportionably to what he eateth, will be very ſoon fat and full flanked.</p>
                     <p>For horſes which are very lean, a man will not very ſuddenly fatten them with Straw, therefore Hay is much more proper for them, if their flanks be not altered, for if they have the leaſt inclination to Purſyneſs, hay is nought for them, becauſe of the reaſons I ſhall hereafter give you in the ſecond part, when I diſcourſe of horſes which is broken-winded or Purſy; and although people very juſtly ſay, that ſuch a horſe hath his flank altered, becauſe he hath a little feeling or touch of Purſyneſs, yet you muſt not imagine That that alteration proceeds from heat, becauſe heat is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an accident of Purſyneſs, and its eſſentiall cauſe flows from a cold principle which is heavy, ſlow, and Viſcuous phlegm, that not only obſtructs and ſtops the conduits of reſpiration, but alſo thoſe paſſages through which the blood runs, for refreſhing and nouriſhing the Lungs, in the time of its perpetuall circulation; but the accidental heat proceeds from this that betwixt the Pulmonary artery and Vein, there is in the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> or bloody and fiſtolous ſubſtance of the Lungs, <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> or paſſages from the Veins to the Arteries, which being many times obſtructed, do occaſion that accidental heat in the Lungs, by reaſon of the heat which is communicated to them from the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Horſes which are inclined to be charged with fleſh in their necks, or to become Thick-necked, ſhould not eat too much wheat ſtraw, becauſe it will increaſe their fleſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as experience will teach you, but, unleſs it be in theſe few exceptions, our Maxim holds alwayes good, Excepting alſo Spaniſh horſes, which as they grow old become ſmaller and thinner Necked, contrary to all other horſes, and I am alſo of opinion, that a Spaniſh horſe which hath a thick and well turned neck, is better than if he had it more ſlender, becauſe his mouth is more certain and firm with it, neither will he be ſo ſubject to Beat upon the hand, or Chack in the Bridle, and therefore will conſequently have a better <hi>Appuy,</hi> or feeling of the preſſure of the Bit upon his Barrs.</p>

                     <p>There is no probability, that this white juice paſſes all of it through the veins, and is wholly converted into Blood which is red; becauſe horſes are compoſed of ſeveral white parts, which require the nutriment of a humour which doth ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them; ſo that in that caſe, it would be but labour in vain to turn white mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to red, that behoved afterwards to become white; for Nature is not accuſtomed to give her ſelf ſuch unnec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſary difficulties; for example, in the production of Milk in Mares, which proceeds directly and immediatly from Chyle, without having been firſt Blood, as the Ancients believ'd, who thought it to be only Blood blanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vertue of the breaſts or Teats, and which people have certainly found ſince, that it is not, but that milk is immediatly formed of Chyle: However whether this be ſo or not, the change of it into Blood, and the the perfecting of this converſion, paſſes for the Second concoction.</p>
                     <p>The Third concoction, which we are to conſider, is performed in each particular part of the Body, which converts the humour that is moſt conform to it into its proper ſubſtance, that ſo it may repair what it loſeth every moment, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction or digeſtion is termed <hi>Aſſimilation,</hi> which is properly what we call Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Each of theſe Concoctions have their particular excrements, theſe of the firſt are the <hi>Ordour</hi> or dung, thoſe of the ſecond is the Urine, which paſſeth through the Reins, and is carried and conveyed by the Ureters into the Bladder; to theſe People ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times add the Bile or Gall, which is ſeparate from the reſt in the Liver, and degorges it ſelf into the inteſtines: People doubt to what concoction <hi>Pituite</hi> or flegm (which ſometimes floateth in the ſtomack, and alwayes in the Gutts) doth belong; neither are they more certain of Melancholy, which is ſaid to be thrown back into the Spleen: In effect, people perceive, in ſound and wholeſome Bodies, no ſenſible and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable excretions or voydings, of theſe three laſt humours.</p>
                     <p>The excrements of the third concoction, upon whoſe account I have made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, too prolix I am afraid for ſome, but too ſhort for the Curious, are of two ſorts; the one ſubtile which exhale and evaporate by inſenſible transpiration, and the other more groſs or thick, which cleave to and remain upon the horſe's skin, and as they are naturally ſaltiſh, ſo they acquire a new acrimony by the ſtay they make upon it, which makes horſes of vigour unquiet and dull, if People take not care to remove it daily, in the duſt which they take away with the Curry-comb, and wipe off with a Cloath from their skins; this excrement of the third Concoction, although inperceptible, doth abound extremely in all Creatures, but particularly in horſes.</p>
                     <p>And it was this that obliged the Ancients, who had not the uſe of Linnen Cloath, to make daily uſe of a Bath; and alſo to cleanſe themſelves, they made uſe of a kind of ſcouring inſtrument, which the Romans called <hi>Strigil,</hi> from whence the French word <hi>Etrille,</hi> which ſignifieth a Currie-comb is derived: Indeed, if we conſider how many humours evacuate through the pores of the skin, we ſhall find a prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them, whereof the computation is abundantly eaſie, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Weight the Hay, Oats, and Water, in fine all that a horſe ſwalloweth during the ſpace of twenty four hours, weight likewiſe his Excrements and Urine which he voids in the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>LEt us return again to our ſubject,<note place="margin">CHAP. L. How horſes are to be Curry'd and dreſt.</note> and ſay that of neceſſity horſes ſhould be Curry'd, and that to do it well, one Groom cannot take care of or dreſs above ſix; and if People deſire that he perform his work well, they ſhould not charge him with any more, for I aſſure you he would but very badly acquite himſelf; neither muſt he have any other work to do in the Lodging, to the end he may be alwayes about the ſtable.</p>
                     <p>A Groom ſhould be Active, Adroit, Nimble, Vigorous, and Hardy, ſhould love horſes, and have a defire to performe his work well; when a man findeth one with theſe qualities, he ſhould not eafily part with him, for this Merchandice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though groſs and clowniſh, is hard enough to be found in many places of the Countrey.</p>
                     <p>He ſhould then riſe early in the morning, immediatly make clean the Manger before his horſes, and give to each of them a good meaſure full of Oats, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very near as much as the Crown of a large hat, which will be near two of theſe commonly made uſe of in the Inns.</p>
                     <p>He ſhould alſo truſs up their Litter with a wooden Fork, (one ſhod with Iron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous for pricking) ſeparate the dry from the wet for the next evening, and take that which is dirty and ſpoilt to the Dung-hill; he ſhall afterwards make clean and ſweep the whole ſtable, and all day long keep it neat and in good order with the Broom and Shovel, for it is no-wiſe decent to ſee a horſe's dung lying beneath him in the day time.</p>
                     <p>It is however good during the great Forſts in Winter, to ſhake down again the Litter beneath the horſes, after it hath been cleand, and to leave it ſo all day long;

                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:179659:101"/>that are very good, they are woven of groſs hair threed, as the countrey peoples courſe cloath is made of that of wool; with this they wipe theirhorſes and take away all the duſt, rub them very well betwix the legs, thighs, and all other parts of the Body whereat the Curry-comb and Bruſh cannot come, after which they waſh them in a pail of water, and ſo hang them up to dry: I admire that the uſe of them has not been brought into <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing they are both good and cheap, for in <hi>England</hi> they are very common.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome horſes ſo very ſenſible and tickliſh, that they will not ſuffer the Curry-comb, yea with difficulty can they endure the Bruſh; theſe require to be dreſt only with the palm of ones hand, which is kept a little moiſt with water, and paſt flat alongſt the horle's Body as if he were Bruſh'd, when the hand is ſufficiently charged with duſt, then it is to be waſht and half dryed and they continue thus to paſs it with and againſt the hair, until they can take away no more duſt, and then at laſt they ſmooth down the hair, to make it appear the more Gloſſy.</p>
                     <p>This method of dreſſing a horſe is Tedious, but good, becauſe it renders the skin very beautiful, and keeps the body alwayes clean; there is not a better for this purpoſe, and thoſe who have horſes of a very tender and delicate skin, ſhould never ſuffer them to be dreſt otherwayes.</p>
                     <p>For large horſes which have a fine skin, a Groom ſhould make it his buſineſs to dreſs them more with the Bruſh, and palm of his hand, than with the Curry-comb, becauſe as they have a deſicate Coat, ſo the Curry-comb ſcratches and galls them, which makes them oppoſe their keeper, and fret and torment themſelves to no purpoſe; whereas with a little more time, the Bruſh and hand as I have directed, would keep them more clean and neat, without giving them ſo much trouble with the Curry-comb.</p>
                     <p>When a horſe is well dreſt after this manner, his ſweat when he is warm will come from him clear as Water; if he be exactly well dreſt the firſt day with the hand, the next morning there will be almoſt nothing to do, but the firſt time he is dreſt after this faſhion, it will take near three houts to make him very clean, but afterwads one hour a day will be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>After all this, the Groom ſhould Comb and Gently diſentangle the hairs of his Mane, beginning alwayes at the lower parts of them and not at the roots, then he ſhall take his Tail in a full handfull, about a foot from the lower end, and ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gently rid and diſentangle it with the Comb, aſcending alwayes by degrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be all very well ſeparate; there are ſome people who will never ſuffer their horſes Tails to be Combed, for fear they be pulled out and ſhortned by it.</p>
                     <p>The Comb, being charged with duſt, is to be waſhed, and every Groom when he is dreſſing a horſe ſhould have a pail of Water by him; after he hath as I have ordered, unreveled and ſeparate the hairs of the Mane and Tail, he muſt then take a piece of ſponge dipt in water, into the left hand, and the Mane-comb in his right, and ſhall comb down the Mane beginning at it's root, and wetting it with the ſpunge after each ſtroak of the Comb; next he ſhall comb the Tail beginning alſo at it's root, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſmoothing down the hair upon the upper part of his dock with the wet ſponge, after which he ſhall wipe down the Mane and Tail with a dry Hair-cloath, to remove any ſuperfluous moiſture.</p>
                     <p>When the Tail is foul and dirty, which frequently happeneth to white horſes, then it ſhould be dipt and ſoak't a little in a pail of Water, and afterwards well ſcoured and rubbed betwixt ones hands; there are ſome who make uſe of black ſoap, or white in its place when it cannot be had; others again cauſe waſh their horſes tails once every day, and then truſs or tye them up neatly, that they may be preſerved clean when they either go to the City or Countrey, and if it be in the ſummer time, they alſo cauſe waſh their horſes Legs very exactly with a wet ſpunge.</p>
                     <p>They likewiſe cauſe make, for that purpoſe, Bruſhes which are about four fingers broad, and ſomewhat more then half a foot long, that with theſe they may waſh and ſcour their horſes Legs, and clean them of all the duſt that cleaves to them; theſe Bruſhes ſhould be made of Wild-Boar briſtles, and well pitched and rozen'd upon the top, that ſo the Water may not rot the pack-threed which fixes the briſtles to the wood, and thoſe who will not be at this expence, although ſmall, take the half of any old Bruſh, wherewith they ſerve themſelves as with the former, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; they firſt waſh very well the horſes Legs, then rub them with the wet Bruſh which muſt be every moment dipt into Water, the water which firſt cometh from the Leg through the Bruſh, will be white as milk, but the waſhing and rubbing muſt

                     <p>When you return with your horſes from the water, you ſhall laſh a little water upon each leg with your two hands, and afterwards wipe them down with ſtraw, to cauſe the water run off.</p>
                     <p>Some people, ſo ſoon as they return from the water, give their horſes Oats, but I think it is not a good method; becauſe ſeeing a Groom who hath Six horſes to look to, cannot take them all to the water but at Three times, if they were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get Oats immediatly as they come from the water, they would be impatient waiting for the reſt, would Bite and Strike at other, and eat no Hay during all that time.</p>
                     <p>The Horſe-courſers, who are underſtanding in their profeſſion, as it is their cheif deſign to cauſe horſes look plump, round, and full Flanked, cauſe them drink in the Summer time by ſeven a clock in the morning, and give them no drink at all in the Evening, that ſo they may drink the more heartily next Morning, having been ſo long without it; after which they no doubt feed better, and ſo appear more plump, and better Bellyed in the morning; then giving them drink again at two a clock in the afternoon, they feed them after it, which makes them appear full and round all the after-noon, and ſeeing they do not ſhow them in the night-time, they care not whether they then look well or not, but ſuffer them to endure Thriſt, that ſo they may drink the more heartily in the Morning; this method is good to be practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe, who have no other diſign in ſhowing their horſes but to ſell them, but for thoſe who keep and feed them for their own ſervice, I aſſure you the method I have before preſcrived is better.</p>
                     <p>After you have then brought them from the water, you ſhall give them freſh Hay, and ſuffer them to eat of it till Eleven or Tuelve a clock, at which time you are to make clean the Manger, and give each of them two meaſures, or two French pecks of clean ſifted Oats, which is ſomewhat leſs than two Engliſh quarts, which you are to ſuffer them to eat at their own eaſe; others again give them only two ſuch meaſures heaped of wet Bran, which is a very good method for horſes of mannage, becauſe it refreſhes and cools them after their violent exerciſe, and your larger ſiz'd horſes ſtand alſo in need of moiſtning, being generally of a hot conſtitution and full of fire.</p>
                     <p>After they have eaten their Oats or Bran, you are to put them upon a ſnaffle or a vering-bit, their Tails being turned to the Manger, and let them ſtand thus till four a clock in the After-noon: People do not only put horſes upon the Snaffle (or Slaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-bit which is more proper) to prevent their eating, but alſo to diſcharge their brains, this method cauſing them voyd a conſiderable quantity of watery Flegm, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be prejudicial were it not evacuate, and which is a thing very well worth obſervation; for notwithſtanding that there was of old ſo many knowing Anatomiſts, they never diſcovered till of late, the Veſſels by which the <hi>Saliva</hi> or Spittle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the mouth: The Spittle falls from two ſmall conduits, which take their riſe betwixt the <hi>Parotide Glands,</hi> and are inſert between the two neither jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones below the <hi>Crotaphite</hi> Muſcle, from whence by the motion of this Muſcle, and the Tongue, the humour or Spittle falleth by degrees into the mouth; not ſo much as one Author hath mentioned theſe <hi>Salival</hi> Ducts or paſſages, their diſcovery being only made lately at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This time that horſes are ſuffered to ſtand upon the Slavering-bit, produceth a very good effect, for it helpeth the aliments which are frequently in too great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance in the ſtomack (eſpecially being ſwallowed down with greedyneſs) to digeſt, and giveth alſo an appetite to thoſe horſes which want one.</p>
                     <p>If the Groom in turning the horſes from the Manger upon the Snaffle, obſerve that they have not eaten all their Oats, without any manifeſt cauſe, then it is a token that they are either diſguſted or ſick, he is therefore to put theſe upon the <hi>Maſticadour</hi> or Slavering-bit, iuſtead of putting them upon a Snaffle; this Slavering-bit is a kind of Snaffle, which hath two large Aſſes treads, the one a little ſhorter than the other, and which are put into the horſes mouth to cauſe him Slaver, and thereby diſcharge his Brain, I have given the ſhape of it in <hi>plat.</hi> 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 13.</p>

                     <p>The method of making the Liver of Antimony or <hi>Imperial Pouder,</hi> is ſet down in 67 <hi>Chap: of the</hi> 2d. <hi>part, Sect.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>Don't apprehend this remedy at which ſo many people are afraid, for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Purgative to horſes, but cordial, and ſometimes Diuretick, and for the moſt part worketh all its Effects by inſenſible tranſpiration; I know the ſucceſs of it ſo very well, having given it after ſo many different faſhions, that I can aſſure you, you will receive a great deal of ſatisfaction from it: I ſhall not enlarge here upon the good effects which Antimony hath upon horſes, according to its different pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, but ſhall diſcourſe of it hereafter, however I am the firſt who ever made uſe of it for horſes, and diſcovered the great advantage it bringeth them.</p>
                     <p>You are to bleed your horſes which have ate green barley, ſo ſoon as you put them again to their hard meat, that is, to Hay and Oats.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here give an advice to thoſe who cauſe their horſes eat green winter barley, That there are ſome years, in which there happeneth cold Brizes, which proceed from the North winds during that time of year they are at ſoyl, ſo that if they do not take care to cover them well, and to keep the Stable very warm, they will become foundered; now if there happen any to founder while they are eating their green Barley or graſs, immediatly Blood them in the Neck and afterwards give them of the ſtinking pills deſcribed in the 85. <hi>Chap. of the</hi> 2d. <hi>part Sect.</hi> 3. and according to the directions there ſet down; neither are you to forbear the giving them their green Barley, for I aſſure you they will recover and be reſtored again to their health, which I have had proof of many a time.</p>
                     <p>I have known ſome years, in whch there were more then fifty horſes foundered in one little Village near <hi>Paris,</hi> called <hi>La Vilette,</hi> where people commonly graze their horſes, and that by reaſon of a cold wind which happned while they were a grazing.</p>
                     <p>If you are in a place where you have the conveniency of turning your horſes to graſs, they will be very much the better of it if they be young; there are ſome alſo which agree very well with eating green Barley after they are done with grazing.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>Parts,</hi> where the green winter Barley can be eaſily had, a man may give it to his horſes before they be turned to Graſs, becauſe that is a great deal ſooner ready than this, but where he can get no other Barley than that which is ſowen in the Spring, then the graſs is many times in a condition, and ready to be given before the Barley, which is commonly later.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">To give a young horſe Methodically graſs in the feilds, until he be ſeven or eight years old, you are firſt to bleed him in the neck, and then to turn him to graſs two dayes thereafter, taking care that it be alwayes ſo well grown, that the horſe may feed heartily upon it, and you ſhall there leave him both night and day for a Mouth and more,</hi> without either Currying or dreſſing him, and without giving him any other kind of food, but his graſs.</p>
                     <p>Graſs charged with dew purgeth a Horſe, by evacuating all the bad humours which he may have in his Body, and then it afterwards fattens; the dew alſo beſides this, contribures to the recovery of ſpoilt legs, by drying up all the ſuperfluous humours which they may have in them, and if a horſe have any kind of itch or mange, the graſs will recover him: In fine there are few diſeaſes in young horſes, for which graſs is not a ſoveraign remedy, except the Farcy, Glanders, and Purſyneſs, to which it is a great Enemy, as Experience will diſcover to you, contrary to the opinion of many: Graſs is whole ſome and profitable for young horſes, but Coldeth thoſe which are Aged.</p>
                     <p>When a horſe is at graſs, he ſhould have water given him only at Twelve a clock, and in the Evening.</p>
                     <p>In exceſſive hot weather the graſs becometh hard and is no longer wholeſome, and in hot countreys the flies do ſo mightily incommode them in the Meadows, that they

                     <p>It is very fit alſo for ſuch horſes as are extraordinary lean, to give them among their Oats, ſome of the pouder deſcribed in the 66 <hi>Chap. of the</hi> 2d. <hi>part, Sect.</hi> 2. you are likewiſe to give to thoſe horſes which are very Light-bellyed, a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of wheat in the Morning before watering, and continue it for ſome dayes, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to eat Hay as well in the night time as in the day, and to give them but little or no wheat ſtraw at all; Graſs is excellent for ſuch kind of horſes.</p>
                     <p>If it be a Mare which is very Light-bellyed, you muſt cauſe give her a Horſe, becauſe if ſhe hath never had a Foal before, this will ſtretch and enlarge her Belly.</p>
                     <p>In fine, you are to give to all horſes which you intend to fatten, a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of oats, then to thoſe which are a ready plump and in a good condition.</p>
                     <p>Some people ſay, that it is a very good receipt for fattening a horſe, to cauſe rub his Tail tuice a day, with the Oats which he hath left uneaten before him in the Manger, but betuixt too much and too little, as well in Food as in Labour or exerciſe, there is a middle that is far better then the extremes, which are alwayes hurtfull.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes by feeding a horſe too ſtrongly, a man does him more prejudice than good, and People will obſerve them without any manifeſt cauſe to ſweat in the ſtable, eſpecially when they ſleep, and that although the Stable be neither kept too warm, nor the horſe too much Covered; if you perceive this happen to your horſes, it is a certain ſign that they eat too much, for it is the ſame with them as in men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Hippocrates in his Aphoriſms: <hi>Sudor multus ex ſomno citra manifestam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam ciens, corpus multo alimento uti ſignificat.</hi> If after the retrenching his allowance of Food, he ſtill continue to ſweat, he does then in that caſe ſtand in need of purging, according to the ſame Aphoriſme: <hi>ſi vero cibum non capienti hoc fiat, ſignificat quod evacuatione opus habet:</hi> You ſhall therefore purge and repurge him, after which, he will recover more in the ſpace of fifteen dayes, than he would have done in a Month, had he not been thus throughly purged.</p>
                     <p>Although I alledge great difficulties in purging horſes without a neceſſity, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when People know certainly that it is needful, they are to paſs over theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations, and purge them according to the precautions I ſhall give hereafter, when I diſcourſe of Purging.</p>
                     <p>You are to obſerve, that lean, fatigued, and over-rid horſes, which People would ſuddenly fatten, by feeding them exceſſively without any kind of order or rule, are ſubject to take the Farcy; therefore to prevent this, you are not to give them ſo great a quantity to eat at a time, and are alſo to take a little Blood of them now and then.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe to be remarked, that every horſe which drinketh luſtily will be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored, and mend ſooner than he that drinketh little, and when a horſe begins to drink heartily, it is a certain ſign that he will in a ſhort time recover.</p>
                     <p>The beſt method for horſes which eat too greedily, is to ſpread well their Oats, and ſcatter them in the Manger, becauſe having ſome difficulty in gathering them up, they can neither eat them in ſuch haſte, nor ſwallow them unchawed.</p>
                     <p>To feed with ſtraw very ſmall cut, is an invention much made uſe of in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which is a very good one; they have in that Countrey, people who have no other imployment but to cut ſtraw, which they ſell in their ſhops by the buſhel, as they do Oats.</p>
                     <p>Cut ſtraw mixed with Oats, is excellent to prevent a horſ's eating of them too greedily; beſides that it being of it ſelf a very good food, is mighty wholeſome for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="margQuotes">But to fatten a horſe which hath his Flanks a little altered, you are to throw a good handful of Oats amongſt a French Buſhell of cut ſtraw, which is ſomewhat leſs than twelve Engliſh quarts, and moiſtning all with a little water, give it thus to the horſe, for this mixture of the Oats will cauſe him to eat his ſtraw, and ſo to become plumpand fat without ſtuffing his belly with hay: There are ſeveral kinds of Inventions for cutting ſtraw,</hi> therefore every man may cauſe do it after his own method, but that which is ſmalleſt cut is the beſt.</p>

                     <p>People ſhould alwayes place great Saddles, more forwards than hunting Saddles, becauſe if they are ſet too far back and as the Hunting Saddles commonly are, their Bows, which are ordinarly large, and therefore troubleſome to the horſe, will hinder the motion of his ſhoulders; the horſe, being thus ſaddled, is to have his Bridle put into his head, care being alwayes taken not to pull out the hair of his fore-top, as it is frequently the cuſtom for <hi>Mal-adroit</hi> Grooms to do; and after your horſe hath done riding, if he ſweat much, you are immediatly to cauſe lead him to the ſtable if you are near it, and if it be at a diſtance, then you are to take him into ſome ſhelter'd place for a ſhort time, until you have cauſed ſcrape the ſweat from him.</p>
                     <p>But if you are near to the ſtable, then immediatly when you have brought him to it, put him upon the Snaffle, or rather Maſticadour, and having taken off his ſaddle, take a Sweating-knife or Scraper, whereof you may ſee the figure in the 1. <hi>plate,</hi> and holding it with both your hands, and alſo taking care not to cut him with it, ſcrape off all the ſweat which is upon his whole body, going alwayes with the hair, as you ſcrape and make uſe of the knife.</p>
                     <p>Having ſcrap't off exactly his ſweat, rub and wipe his head very well both above and below, with a good large hair-cloath, becauſe being ſuffered to remain moiſt, it is many times the cauſe of defluxions; wipe him alſo betwixt his fore and hind Legs, and then with clean ſtraw rub him carefully over all the body, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneath his belly, after which cover him very well, and ſo leave him until he be perfectly dry: Thoſe who delight extraordinarly in their horſes, cauſe rub them alwayes with ſtraw until they be throughly dry, and the method is good.</p>
                     <p>A horſe which hath ſweat much through exceſſive labour, being exactly wipt down and covered, if the Alley or walk of your ſtable be long enough cauſe lead him up and down in it for a quarter of an hour, and if it be in the ſummer time, you may cauſe lead him in ones hand without doors, but if you have no place which is temperate and warm, then ſuffer him to dry where he ſtandeth.</p>
                     <p>Horſes of mannage which have ſwet extremly, ſhould never be ſuffered to drink before they are throughly cooled, and have ate ſome Oats, for I have known many, which for having drunk too ſoon, have either dyed by it, or become very ſick.</p>
                     <p>The moſt part of Grooms fancy that their horſes have the ſame impatience, and inclination to drink that they themſelves have which is the reaſon that they make alwayes ſo great haſte to give it them; but you are to keep to this Maxim, that a horſe will never be the worſe to be kept half a day from drinking, and may come to dye for having drunk but one hour too ſoon, which I have told you many times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eady, and cannot repeat it too often.</p>

                     <p>A Hunter or Journey-Pad of a reaſonable ſize, will eat more Hay although his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be not ſo violent, both becauſe they are commonly longer of Body, and alſo that when they go to the Feilds to hunt, they are a long time without eating; therefore they muſt have more food to keep them always in good caſe, ſo that people ſhould give to them a <hi>Botte</hi> and a half of Hay, a <hi>Botte</hi> of Straw, and four Meaſures of Oats.</p>

                     <p>In fine, I am of opinion that it is an excellent Maxim, to feed well ſuch horſes as work, as alſo theſe which do not; for it is a true Proverb, that there ſhould be no ſuch thing, as Oats reſting or not made uſe of.</p>

Why horſes Should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways covered in the Stabie.</note> I ſhall give ſome Reaſons that may convince people, of the benefite their horſes receive by being covered, all the twelve Months of the Year, but eſpecially in the Winter ſeaſon; I beleive no man doubts, but that it is firſt to preſerve them from duſt, and to give them a good Coat, but horſes are alſo covered, that they may be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Cold, which is as great an Enemy to them as to men; beſides that a horſe being well covered, hath more heat to digeſt the food he eateth, becauſe the external heat aſſiſts his internal or natural.</p>
                     <p>Cold condenſes the skin, cloſes the pores, and hinders the tranſpiration of thoſe vapours, which are (as I have already explained) the excrements of the third concoction.</p>
                     <p>Exceſſive Cold Chills the internal heat, and therfore maketh the hair to ſtare, which rendereth a horſe ugly and deformed how agreeable ſoever he may be any other way; whereas a good covering will keep his hair ſmooth, ſlickt, and beautifull.</p>
                     <p>Some people, to preſerve horſes from the cold, cloſe up all the windowes and other opens in the ſtable, which renders it unwholſome, becauſe Cold and the agitation of the Air, are very proper to purify it, and therefore in ſome meaſure neceſſary; if there be then any Malignity in it, it will lurk there, which would be prevented, if by covering the horſes people give them ſo much Air, as not to be in danger of being ſtiffled; and moreover if there be amongſt them any horſe which hath weak Eyes, ſuch warm ſtables will compleat the eutire ſpoiling of them.</p>
                     <p>People cover horſes of Value in the Summer time, with a ſingle ſheet only, and which is made of a kind of thin linnen, with a croſs work upon it, called about Paris limber Buckram or <hi>Trelis,</hi> and which is made uſe of in that Seaſon, cheifly to defend them from the duſt, and importunity of the flies.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh cover their horſes of Value in the Winter time, with a linnen ſheet and covering above it, and ſuffer them to lye with it all night; for my part I think they are in the right in ſo doing, but as people ſhould ſhut, and make their ſtables more cloſs in the night time than in the day, ſo I am of opinion, they ſhould take off their upper covering or ſheet in the night time, when they are not ſick, and put it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:179659:109"/>on again in the day, becauſe ſeeing the ſtable is abundantly warm in the night time being made ſo very cloſs, and that the horſes alſo ſleep, their bodyes will tranſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If there are many horſes in a ſtable, they ſhould be but ſlightly covered in the day time, becauſe the heat and breath of ſo great a number of horſes, doth abundantion warm it, and therefore in that caſe the only uſe of covering is to keep down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> great impreſſion of its heat, which is not ſoon extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon why horſes ſhould not be purged, except in a great neceſſity,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:179659:109"/>that the medicaments are commonly twenty four hours in their bodies, before they begin to operate, ſo that during that time they alwayes overheat or alter ſome of the parts, ſeing they don't reſt there without moving, over-heating, or irritating nature: If people could act upon horſes, conform to the doctrine of thoſe who diſapprove purging, they would certainly prevent a great many diſorders, becauſe whatever precautions people may obſerve in preparing them for it, yet they ſo frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark ſuch conſiderable diſorders after its operation, that we may confidently conclude nature ſuffers a great deal by ſuch an evacuation; If we could find out remedies, whereby we might ſo fortifie and redreſs nature, as that ſhe could diſcharge her ſelf of her own accord through the common paſſages, of that which were prejudicial to her, and that ſhe could either overcome and deſtroy theſe bad humours, take away their malignity, or fix them, then certainly People might be freed from that trouble they have in purging them; but for my part, whatever care and diligence I have taken, I have not as yet diſcovered theſe remedies, and if there are ſome Medicaments which may perform a part of this effect, yet they do it not wholly, but leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the humours more attached and faſtned, and more difficult to be evacuate, then the whole would have been, had the remedy been altogether a Specifick for them.</p>
                     <p>Neceſſity hath no Law, and therefore people are many times obliged to purge horſes, but then it ſhould be performed by obſerving the Climate, Seaſon, the different aſpects of the Planets, the diſeaſe, the conſtitution, age, and if poſſible the very nature and diſpoſition of the horſe, which being void of reaſon and ſpeech, cannot diſcover to us his diſtemper, and far leſs what is fit for it.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon, for which we ſhould obſerve exact precautions in purging, proceeds from the difficulty of knowing the condition of the diſeaſe, and the diſpoſition of the humours, which when concocted and digeſted by nature, are eaſily evacuate, but being crude and unprepared are rebellious, and don't yeild to the Remedy; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſeveral kinds of theſe humours, it is very fit to give here a ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them.</p>
                     <p>The diviſion that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> maketh of the parts of Man, is to be obſerved in all Creatures; he eſtabliſhes firſt the ſolid parts, as the bones and fleſh, next the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid parts, as the Blood and humours, and laſtly the ſpirituous parts, which are the Source of life, the principal Organs of Action, and the firſt Springs of all our motions.</p>
                     <p>The Liquid parts, are thoſe humours which are of no fixed and ſtable conſiſtence, they are produced of the Food which people take, and after divers preparations, a part of them is converted into the proper ſubſtance of the ſolid parts, which is called <hi>Nutrition;</hi> another portion of them repaires the loſs and diſſipation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the reſt is rejected as uſeleſs; if the food be proper, right choſen, and taken in time, and in a juſt quantity; if the concoction and preparation of them be made it as ought, and that all the parts which contribute to digeſtion, acquit themſelves exactly well of their functions, and if the unprofitable and ſuperfluous part of them be thrown out, and expelled in its due time, and in juſt quantity through the common paſſages, then there is formed a perfect Health, which is rare in Men; becauſe their paſſions, and the diſturbance of their Body and Spirits, produce a great deal of diſorder, from which horſes are exeemed; and I do really believe, that the paſſions, and irregular deſires in Men, are a conſiderable part of the cauſe, why they have not a health ſo throughly and firmly eſtabliſhed, as otherwiſe it would; yea we even ſee, that horſes without having paſſions, are not in a perfect ſtate of Health, and that through la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which is either given them immoderatly, or unſeaſonably, or otherways by reaſon of bad nouriſhment, as I ſhall ſhow you more at large in the 2d. part.</p>
                     <p>If it happen that the food be improper, altered and corrupted, and either taken unſeaſonably, or in too great or ſmall a quantity, if the Digeſtion be out of order, or if the Excretions or voidings are diſordered, then is the whole Oeconomy of the Body perverted, its forces diminiſh, and Diſeaſes are brought upon it, ſo that in this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it produces humours, which degenerate from the excellency of the Blood; and to facilitate the underſtanding of theſe according to their different Compariſons, people make ſeveral kinds of diviſions of them: ſome compare them to Milk, and ſay that the pureſt blood, conſidered in the perfection of its maſs, anſwers to the intire ſubſtance of Milk, and that there are three parts which compoſe it, Bile anſwers to Butter, Melancholly to Cheeſe, and Phlegm to Whey; thoſe again who compare the Humours to the Elements and Seaſons of the Year, ſay that Blood correſponds
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:179659:110"/>to the Spring and to Air, and give it the qualities of hot and moiſt, that the Bile ſembles Summer, to which they give the qualities of hot and dry, not formally virtually, and that phlegm hath an affinity to water, which is cold and moiſt, therefore hath a conformity to Winter and to the Moon; that Melancholy is cold dry, and ſo cometh near to the nature of Earth, becauſe of the cold which is eſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to it.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts have attempted to find out a conformity, betwixt the humours; their own principles, but ſeeing they have not as yet agreed about it amongſt the ſelves, it is difficult to eſtabliſh any thing which may prove ſolid, upon prince which are ſtill controverted and debated; therefore we ſhall have no regard to the but adhere to that which is moſt agreeable to the ends of Purging.</p>
                     <p>People ſhould not think of purging blood, conſidered as Blood, becauſe if it abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>People call that a purgative Medicament, which being taken inwardly, hath the faculty to expell through the common paſſage of the Belly, thoſe humours which it meets with in the Body; there are ſome of theſe which purge only by lenifying and ſweetn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as Oyles, Greaſes, and Butter, and which by moiſtning and Greaſing the interior ſuperfice of the inteſtines, facilitate the deſcent and evacuation of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other humours; there are others of them again which by their abundance of moiſture, dilute and ſoften ſo extremely the humours, that they cauſe all of them that are contained in the bowels, to glide along with them and be evacute, ſuch as Whey, the decoction of <hi>Beets,</hi> of <hi>Pellitory of the wall,</hi> of <hi>Coleworts,</hi> of <hi>Spinage,</hi> and others; and ſo likewiſe <hi>Graſs</hi> which is given to horſes in the Month of May, purges them by ſoaking and ſoftning the humours, and cauſing them to paſs eaſily through the Bowels, by reaſon of their great humidity.</p>
                     <p>All ſharp and piquant things, do likewiſe irritate and excite the expulſive faculty, ſuch as almoſt all Salts, the ſeed of Nettles, and many others; but all theſe remedies, are rather laxative and deterſive, than true purgatives.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe remedys which have the faculty, to purge moſtly conform to the humours which they evacuate, are of four ſorts; theſe are called <hi>Cholagogs</hi> which Purge Bile and Choler.</p>

                     <p>Now notwithſtanding of this people muſt not fancy, that the remedys of one claſs do only purge and expell one particular humour, for how ſimple ſoever the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be, yet it will purge a part of all: <hi>Sene,</hi> for example, is ſo univerſal a Drug, that there is no Medicament wherein it may not be uſed, nor none of the humours which it doth not expell; thoſe who ſay that purgatives Act conform to the Similitude of ſubſtance, have a great deal of difficulty to diſcover the reſemblance, which ſo ſimple a Drug hath with humours ſo very different; but that which people ſhould cheifly conſider in a purgative, is its ſtrength or weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt it be thought that in a Malignant diftemper, a gentle remedy will perform a great effect, it would alſo be very unreaſonable, for a ſmall indiſpoſition to make uſe of a violent remedy, if people fail in any ſide, it ſhould rather be in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too weak, than too ſtrong remedys; and as all purgatives have a kind of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it is therefore very fit they ſhould be corrected: People ſhould alſo know that a remedy given in Subſtance, for example in powder, ſhould be made uſe of in a leſs quantity, then when it is only infuſed in ſome Liquor, and the ſolid Subſtance thrown away.</p>
                     <p>Generaly ſpeaking, no infuſion of any Drug whatſoever will purge a horſe, he muſt therefore have the remedys given to him in their proper Subſtance, becauſe their infuſion paſſes too quickly, and continues not long enough in a horſes Body, that ſo it may purge him, for he is a creature ſo difficult to be wrought upon, that although a Drug be given him in Subſtance, yet it will be four and twenty hours in his Body before it begin to purge, and an infuſion which is liquid, paſſes commonly in five or ſix, ſo that it hath little or no effect: Indeed people may make uſe of an infuſion as they do of a decoction, to mix theſe Drugs withall, wherewith they intend to purge the horſe, and give him them both together, to increaſe in ſome meaſure their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but not otherwiſe.</p>

                        <hi>Black-Hellebor</hi> is a root which purges Melancholy, and other aduſt Humors which are opiniater or obſtinate, and is therefore excellent for Melancholick Conſtitutions; it is corrected by firſt waſhing it well with Water, then infuſing it four hours in ſtrong Vinegar, after which it is to be dryed before a gentle fire: the Doſe is from ſix Drams to an Ounce, and people may add to it <hi>Cinnamon, Anniſeeds,</hi> and <hi>Fennel.</hi>

                     <p>Melancholy is a very obſtinate humour, and does not eaſily yeild to purgatives, unleſs after a great irritation of nature; and I have lately found by experience, that <hi>Diureticks,</hi> that is remedies which expell the humours by Urine, do more agreeably evacuate melancholy in Horſes, than any other; becauſe they receive leſs trouble in their whole natural oeconomy, and are more eaſed and relieved by them, than with any other of what kind ſoever.</p>

                     <p>WHen a Horſe requires it, and that there is an abſolute neceſſity to purge him, after having diſcovered the nature, qualities, quantity,<note place="margin">CHAP. LXIII How, and at what time to adminiſter a purge to a horſe.</note> and place of the Humor which offends, and remarked the nature of the diſeaſe, and known the conſtitution of the Horſe, as well by his Actions as by his Coat or Skin, you are next to run through the liſt of your purgative Medicaments, and make choice of ſuch of them, as will beſt anſwer your deſign.</p>
                     <p>You are likewayes to take Notice to the time when you reſolve to purge him, for upon it in ſome meaſure depends the good or bad Succeſs of its operation, which is what few or none of thoſe who undertake the Cure of horſes obſerve, although I have many times remarked, that the like purgation given to one and the ſame horſe at ſundry times, does work effects ſo different the one from the other, that one would take it to be not only a diſtinct remedy, but another horſe.</p>
                     <p>You are therefore as much as poſſible to purge horſes in the decreaſe of the Moon, becauſe Nature, at that time, hath not ſuch averſion to quit with the humours, and ſuffer their evacuation, as in the Increaſe; therefore they are detached with leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for we ſee that moſt Creatures, have leſs Marrow in their bones in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe than Increaſe, which is juſt ſo with the humours, which diminiſhing and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſing in a manner with the Moon, a Man may therefore eaſily and Succeſsfuly purge horſes at that time, if the remedy Act but never ſo little conjunctly with that <hi>Planet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And you are not only to purge them in the decreaſe of the Moon, but you are alſo to chooſe for that effect, ſuch a day as ſhe is in a watery Sign; to wit in <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> which are cold and moiſt Signs: And this you are to practiſe as much as poſſible, and if you pleaſe to be very exact in your obſervations afterwards, you will find that the purges given them in theſe days, will occaſion leſs weakneſs, leſs diſguſt, and will cauſe a better evacuation, than if you did adminiſter it to them in the increaſe of the Moon, and in a fiery, hot, or dry Sign, ſuch as <hi>Aries, Sagittarius,</hi> and <hi>Lee,</hi> in which it would have the quite contrary effect.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, there are certain times in the year in which horſes ſhould not be purged, to wit in the <hi>Aequinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solſtices;</hi> the <hi>Aequinoxes</hi> are about the 11. of <hi>March,</hi> and the 11. <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Solſtices</hi> about the 11. of <hi>Junce</hi> and the 1 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> a day or two in or over; you are therefore neither to purge nor let blood, but in caſes of great neceſſity, two dayes before and two dayes after any of the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed times; becauſe they are as Critical dayes, in which Nature maketh an effort, to drive out and expell that which was prejudicial to her: So that if people ſhould then by a purgative Medicament, force her to perform a motion contrary to her own, they would hinder her to effectuate that for which ſhe was prepared, and that alſo not without being hurtfull and prejudicial, to the conſtitution and health of the Creature; you are then to abſtain from purging horſes, not only upon theſe above mentioned dayes themſelves, but a few dayes both before and after, to wit, from the 7. of <hi>March</hi> to the 15. and from the 7. of <hi>September</hi> to the 15. of the ſame, which are the times of the two <hi>Aequinoxes;</hi> and betwixt the 7, of <hi>June</hi> and the 16. and the 7. of <hi>December</hi> and the 16. of the ſame, which are the two <hi>Solſlices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may alſo if you have any knowledge in the <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> obſerve over and above the preceeding directions, not to purge your horſes when the Moon is either

                     <p>For people cannot commit ſmall errors in giving too violent purgatives; becauſe when once they are in a horſes body, they are no more Maſters of them; they work many times with ſuch diſorder, that if they don't kill the horſe, yet they leave at leaſt ſo great a diſtemper in the inward parts, that a man cannot of a long time recover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them; it is this which made me reduce theſe purgative Doſes to ſuch a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as that they cannot occaſion this diſorder: If your horſe hath not purged ſufficiently, with the Medicament you have adminiſtrate to him, there is nothing loſt, becauſe it hath diſpoſed the humour, and by reiterating the purgation ſome dayes after, and making it a little ſtronger, you will find it ſucceed very well.</p>
                     <p>Having provided your ſelf of the quantity of Drugs you have uſe for, you are to break and beat them courſly, and if it be for pills, then mix the compoſition with two pounds of freſh <hi>Bacon lard,</hi> or for want of it, the like quantity of freſh <hi>Butter,</hi> and having beat and mixed all well together in a Mortar, make it up into pills about the bigneſs of ſmall Tennis-Balls, which you are to cauſe the horſe ſwallow down.</p>
                     <p>If it be for a <hi>Drench,</hi> you are alſo to beat them courſly, and either mix them with a Decoction, or amongſt Wine, and letting it infuſe about a quarter of an hour, give it to the horſe early in the Morning with a horn, he being firſt tyed up two hours to the Rack, before it be Adminiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>If you are only to make a ſimple infuſion of them, and which hath no great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon horſes, then the Drugs being infuſed all night, the liquor is to be poured off next Morning, amongſt which you are to diſſolve ſome kind of <hi>Electuary</hi> or <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in a ſufficient quantity, that ſo it may purge and operate according as you have determined; the horſe having taken it, you are to rinſe the horn with the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Decoction, or with <hi>Wine,</hi> and make him ſwallow it, after which you ſhall alſo waſh his Mouth with a little Wine, to take away its bad reliſh.</p>
                     <p>If it be Pills you are to make uſe of, then the horſe having ſwallowed them, you are to give him in a horn ſome <hi>White-Wine,</hi> to carry them well down to his Stomack, to ſoak and ſoften them, and alſo to waſh his Mouth, and take away its bitterneſs.</p>

                     <p>When the horſe ſhall begin to purge, you are to cauſe walk him half an hour in ones hand every two hours, and continue it for half a day, that ſo it may the better aſſiſt him to empty.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo, as much as poſſible, to forbear purging in violent Colds and exceſſive heats; if nevertheleſs you are neceſſitate to do it, and that it be in Winter, you are then to keep the horſe well covered, and put him in a warm ſtable, from whence he muſt not ſtir during his purgation, becauſe Cold hindereth the operation of the Medicament; but if it be in Summer, then you are to keep him in a cool and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate place.</p>
                     <p>When the horſe hath done purging, you may if you will give him a <hi>Glyster,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Evacuation of that which the Medicament hath not brought away, but only in a manner detatched or looſed; after which, you may feed and order him, as formerly.</p>
                     <p>It is very fit, that a horſe from the time he hath taken a purgation, until it be quite done working, (which will be about 40 hours) eat no Hay but only Wet-Bran, taking care always to take him from the Rack at the end of every four hours, that ſo he may eat two Meaſures of Wet-Bran, which are each of them ſomewhat leſs, than two Engliſh Quarts.</p>

                     <p>THe Common Farriers,<note place="margin">CHAP: LXVI How to give a Horſe a Glyſter.</note> don't give to horſes above an Engliſh quart or three pints of Decoction for a Glyſter, neither have they generally a great effect, for beſides that the liquor is given in too ſmall a quantity, they alſo ſpare the Drugs, and commonly mix nothing with the Decoctions, but <hi>ſalted water, honey,</hi> and <hi>Oyl;</hi> however it is not, but if People would pay them as they deſire, they would perhaps make them good: My opinion is, that there is required for a Glyſter at leaſt two or three Engliſh quarts of Decoction, becauſe being in a leſs quantity then that, it but moiſtens and waſhes little; for as a horſe drinks ten times more then a man, and that People give alſo twenty times more then the doze for a man to purge him, it follows that the ſame proportion ſhould be obſerved for his Glyſters.</p>
                     <p>A Glyſter being prepared after this manner, ſhould not be given till the horſes great Gut be cleared of its dung, which by Farriers is called <hi>Raiking,</hi> and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by firſt anointing your hand well with a little <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> and then thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up into his Fundament, taking care not to ſcratch the Gut with your Nailes, and with it drawing forth all the dung you can conveniently bring away; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thruſt up into it, about the bigneſs of a large Hens Egg of Caſtile Soap, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with Oyl to make it enter with the more eaſe, half an hour after which, the horſe will empty, ſo that uſing this, you need not thruſt up your hand to <hi>Raik</hi> him, becauſe the Soap will do it ſufficiently of it ſelf; having thus <hi>Raik't</hi> or cauſed your horſes to empty, you are next to place him with his fore-parts a little lower than his Croupe, and thruſting in to his Fundament, a horn made for that purpoſe open at the ſmall end, pour into it by degrees the Glyſter, which muſt be but <hi>Milk-warm,</hi> and if it ſhould ſtop in the born without paſſing down, you are to make the horſe move his Tongue, and then ſtrike him gently with the palm of your hand upon the Reins, which will make it enter, after which you are to put your horſe in the ſtable again tyed up to the Rack, without moving him afterwards, contrary to the common practice, for the Farriers ordinarly cauſe walk a horſe, while the Glyſter is yet in his Guts.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo fit that your horſe by tyed up to the Rack two hours before he take his Glyſter, and that he alſo eat none untill he hath rendered it, or about an hour after he hath taken it.</p>
                     <p>People ſhould alſo endeavour as much as poſſible, to give horſes their Glyſter with a <hi>Seringe,</hi> as they do men, but then it muſt be made ſo large as to contain the whole Glyſter, and the hollow of its pipe which enters his Fundament ſhould be ſo big, as that a man may put his finger into it; this method is better than that with a horn, for it is both quicklier done, and the horſe receives it better, without ſo much as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be taken out of the ſtable, and therefore as he is leſs moved after receiving it, ſo he will have the leſs cauſe to render it too ſoon; this method is at preſent much in

                     <p>But before I give you the Reaſons which oblidge to let Blood, I ſhall in a few words explain how Blood is produced in the bodies of Animals, according to the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and curious Opinion, although called New, by many of the old Phyſicians; for I fancied I would ſatisfie the curioſity of many People, by inſerting here this Opinion, which is founded upon many Experiments, the moſt convinceing in the World: To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend then how the Blood is made, you muſt know that the ſubſtance of a Horſes body, is ſubject to a continual diſſipation, by reaſon of the natural heat which inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly acts againſt its radical moiſture, therefore Nature, to repair that diminution of its proper Subſtance, hath given to Creatures a natural Appetite, which excites the animal appetite; for in time of hunger, the parts ſucking and mutually drawing their nouriſhment from one another, there is made a divulſion, and conſequently a ſenſe of feeling, which giveth them no reſt until that appetite be ſatisfied: Being in this condition, they take food, cut it, and grind it with their teeth, then they kned or mix it with the help of their Spittle, and by the aſſiſtance of their Tongue, throw it unto the Stomack, there to be boyled and converted into a white liquor, called <hi>Chyle:</hi> The animal Appetite being ſatisfied and the breaches repaired, which were made by faſting, the inferior orifice of the Stomack opens, and ſuffers the <hi>Chyle</hi> to run into the ſmall guts, from whence it is ſuckt by an infinite number of white Veins, called by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their whiteneſs, <hi>Lacteal,</hi> which are diſperſed through the whole <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. The Second Reaſon is the exceſſive heat of the blood, which cauſes it to ſparkle in the Veins; in this caſe blooding refreſhes, and appeaſes the boiling of it.</p>

The Third Reaſon that obliges us to let blood, is that we may take away the corrupt Humors contained in the Veins: which by their putrefaction can only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce bad effects, therefore nature being eaſed by this evacuation, doth the more eaſily digeſt the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Reaſon is, that when the blood hath not liberty enough to run, and

                     <p>However there are ſome Authors, who do not approve of Blooding by way of prevention, ſaying that if people chance to neglect it, at that time in which they we: accuſtomed to practiſe it, it would occaſion ſome indiſpoſition to the horſe, and the therefore a horſe ſhould never be bled by way of prevention, but in the pale: <hi>Philippo Scacco</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>Di Meſcalzia,</hi> is of this ſentiment.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:179659:119"/>in the ſpace of a year, is renewed every ſix hours, which is the time wherein the whole Circulation of the Blood is perfected, as an infinite number of experiments have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and to explaine it breifly, people have remarked that the Heart beats about 4000 times in an hour, this motion or beating of the heart is called <hi>Syſtolo</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> which is all one with <hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Compreſſion:</hi> By each <hi>Diaſtole</hi> the Heart attracts to it ſelf from the Veins, about half a dram of blood, and by each <hi>Syſtole</hi> ſends ſo much forth from it ſelf into the Arterys, all which being exactly calculate, a horſe will have in his Body about 50. pounds of Blood, which will all paſs through the two Ventricles of the heart in about ſix hours ſpace, by running from the Veins to the Ventricles, and from the Ventricles into the great Artery; and in each tour or Circulation that the Blood maketh, one of the above-mentioned humors will be predominant, in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>From midnight to ſix a clock in the Morning, it is the Blood that predominates; from ſix to twelve a clock in the day it is Phlegm, from twelve a clock till ſix at night it is Bile, and from ſix to midnight it is Melancholy: This which I affirme may ſeem to be a Vain diſcourſe, without any kind of ground or ſolid foundation, but you may ſatisfie your ſelf by an eaſie experiment, made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Endeavour to know the temper of your horſe, and let us ſuppoſe him to be bilious, then draw Blood of him betwixt twelve a clock in the day, and ſix a clock at night, that is to ſay about four, and you will find, that as you have made the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in that time wherein Bile did predomine, ſo you will have evecuate a great deal of Bile, which will convince you of the truth of what I affirme, becauſe it will be almoſt all Bile; whereas if you ſhould take blood from the ſame horſe about four a clock in the Morning, which is the time that blood predominats, you will then find his blood good, and but a little mixture of Bile amongſt it, and ſo of the other humors.</p>
                     <p>This change in the Maſs of the blood, is a certain token of its circulation, and in effect if it had not this motion, it would corrupt after the ſame manner, as thoſe humors that are in the Body do, who either ly ſtill, or are ſtopt in ſome part of the Body, and which by reaſon of their putrefaction, are the cauſe and origine of many diſeaſes: And Blood, did it not circulate, would ſo much the more eaſily purifie, in that it containes in it the principles of Corruption, to wit Heat and Moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Now this being laid down as a Principle, is it not very advantagious to evacuate the humor that offends, or cauſes any indiſpoſition in the Horſe? this may no doubt be done by this Obſervation, which is to take blood of him in that time, wherein the humor which a man intends to evacuate doth moſt predomine in the Veins; but upon the contrary, Blooding will be prejudicial to him, if practiſed at any other time, becauſe there will then be evacuate an humor, which neither offends in quantity nor quality; it is therefore of greateſt conſequence, to obſerve exactly the time and hour, in which it is moſt proper to Blood a horſe.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo to be remarked, that the Compleat Circulation of the blood, is not always preciſely performed each ſix hours, becauſe of the temper of the horſe, therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be phlegmatick, in that caſe it will exceed the ſix hours, but if it be Bilious, then it will be accompliſhed in leſs than ſix, and ſo of the reſt; To prevent therefore your being deceived by this, I have ordered the time of Blooding, to be four hours after that the humor which ſhould prodominate in that time of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, hath begun to change and increaſe; for example, for ſuch horſes as are Bilious at four a clock at night, that ſo you may not be miſtaken, and perform a Bleeding that will be uſeleſs, and unprofitable for your horſe.</p>
                     <p>I lay down then for an infallible Rule, that the Sanguine horſe ſhould be bled at four in the Morning, the pituitous or Phlegmatick at ten, the Bilious or fiery at four a clock in the afternoon, and the Melancholick at ten at night; and if till now, you have performed many Bloodings which have produced bad effects, it is becauſe you did not know, and make uſe of theſe Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Blooding ſhould be alſo practiſed as much as poſſible, in the increaſe of the Moon, and never when ſhe is in the ſigns of <hi>Leo</hi> or <hi>Taurus</hi> when the Blood is to be taken from the Neck; or if it be from any other part of the Body it is to be taken, you are then to obſerve never to take Blood from that part which is governed by any ſign, while the Moon is in that ſign; for example, in the Fore-thighs or plat Veins when the Moon is in <hi>Gemiui.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The letting of Blood ſhould be alſo performed in a calm and clear day, and which is free from clouds and fogs; becauſe the Veins being emptyed a little by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:179659:120"/>Blooding, do immediatly attract into their vacuities, the Air which is an unive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But People moſt commonly blood them in the <hi>Jugular Veins,</hi> which lye in each ſide of the neck near to the throat, they blood them there for prevention, but it ſhould never be done when the Moon is in <hi>Taurus</hi> ♉; this being obſerved as much as poſſible, a Horſe may be bled in that part, for ſeveral Diſeaſes, as I have already told you; to wit for the Farcy, Mange, Diſeaſes of Repletion or too great abundance of Blood, and many others.</p>
                     <p>People take blood from the <hi>Temples,</hi> for the infirmities in the Eyes occaſioned by accident, if the Moon be not in <hi>Aries</hi> ♈; theſe Infirmities muſt proceed from ſtrokes, bites, or blows, and then the Veins in thoſe parts are to be opened with a ſmal Lance.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are bled beneath the <hi>Tongue</hi> for Head-akes, or for being diſguſted and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heated by exceſſive Labour, or for Colicks, and the Vives; people have a little Lance, made purpoſly for opening the Veins in that part.</p>
                     <p>They alſo bleed Horſes in the <hi>Griſtle</hi> of the <hi>Noſe,</hi> by ſtrikeing it through with an <hi>Awl</hi> or Botkin, without regarding whether they hit the Vein or not, and that for Colicks, Vives, and for being very much overheated by exceſſive rideing.</p>
                     <p>As alſo in the middle of the <hi>Palate</hi> above the fourth Bar, when a Horſe is diſguſted; they bleed them in this part more conveniently with a Lance, than with a Horn, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though people commonly term it, the ſtrikeing a Horſe in the Palate with a Horn; it is good for Horſes which are dull, haraſſed and overheated.</p>
                     <p>This bleeding in the Palate, is many times practiſed with a great deal of ſucceſs, by perſons who know not why they do it: They give to their Horſes every firſt <hi>Tueſday</hi> of the Month, a ſtroke in the Palate with a Lance, or ſharp Horn, (in French <hi>un Coup de Corne</hi>) and then cauſe receive the blood amongſt a meaſure of bran, which the Horſe afterwards eats, and theſe Horſes which are thus ordered, are obſerved to thrive extraordinarly; I know no reaſon for this, only experience hath diſcovered to me that the practice of it is pretty good, although I am altogether ignorant of its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>If it happen that your Horſe loſe too much blood, by a ſtroke thus given him in the Palate, you are to raiſe his head very high, by tying a cord about his upper fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth, as if you were going to give him a drench, and then the blooding will ſtop of its own accord.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw once a Horſe who dyed of a ſtroke, thus given him in the Palate with a ſharp horn, and whereof they could not ſtop the blooding, neither with Vitriol, nor with a button of fire, or any thing elſe they could apply, ſo that the Horſe loſt all his blood

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take four Engliſh Quarts, or half a Peck, of good well ground Malt,<note place="margin">How to make a Mash.</note> and put it into a Pailor wooden Veſſel by it ſelf; then take a Gallon, or four Engliſh Quarts of fair Water, and ſet it on the fire, and when it hath boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very little, put as much of it into the Malt as will moiſten it, working and stirring them with a piece of flat wood, after which, pour in the reſt of the Water, and mix all very well together, then cover up the Veſſel cloſs with a double covering, or ſome Cloaths, and let it ſtand thus for two hours, or till ſuch time as you intend to give it to your Horſe; the Maſh being thus made, and your Horſe ready to take it, uncover the Veſsel, and with your hand stir all well together, cruſhing and ſqueezing the Mait as much as poſſible, and when luke-warm, give it the Horſe to drink: It muſt. I ſay, be little more as milk warm, when he taketh it, and if it ſhould prove either too hot, or too thick, when you are to give it, you may rectifie both, by adding a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cold Water to it, but be ſure not ſo much, as to make it either too cold, which would turn it raw, or too thin, which would abate a great deal of its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant taste and strength: You may alſo, if you intend he ſhould eat none of the Grain or Malt, (a little whereof can never do him prejudice) ſqueeze the Liquor quite from it, and ſo let him drink it, throwing away the Malt, or rather giving it to your Hogs or Cows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This is the beſt Method I know to make a good Maſh, which in many caſes is found to agree well with Horſes, eſpecially ſuch as are any-wiſe indiſpoſed, or ſick, and which was therefore the cauſe of my ſetting it down in this place, our</hi> Author <hi>not having, as I have ſaid, made the leaſt mention of it, to my knowledge, in his whole Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> cauſe gallop their Horſes before blooding, to the end ſay they, that the bad blood which is as the Lee, may be mixed with the good, and ſo both drawn together; but they are deceived in this, becauſe the blood is filled with Spirits, which being agitate and ſtirred up with this kind of courſing, doth immediatly evaporate in a great abundance, with the moſt ſubtile part of the blood, when ever the Vein is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, ſo that blooding after this manner, is more prejudicial than profitable.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe who thus cauſe their Horſes gallop before blood-letting, were perſwaded of the Circulation of the Blood, they would not be in ſo groſs an Error, as to believe that the Blood is with the ſame tranquillity in the Veins, as Wine is in a Hogs-head, whoſe Lee lyeth at bottom; but would be convinced, that the whole Maſs of the Blood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates, as well the groſs part, as that which is more ſubtile; ſeing then this is ſo, there is no need of any violent agitation of it, ſuch as galloping, to oblige it to come forth, but rather upon the contrary, the Horſe ſhould be kept calm and quiet, for fear of evacuating and loſſing too many of his Spirits, as I have already explained.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are very careful of their Horſes, cauſe them eat only Bran in place of Oats, both the day before Blooding, the day it ſelf, and the day thereafter, and for theſe three days they ſhould alſo let them reſt, or at leaſt that day wherein they are bled, and alſo give them only bran in it.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo in taking blood, to regulate the quantity according as your Horſe is a great feeder, and as his Veins are full and ſtretched, and accordingly as it iſſues forth with violence, having ſtill regard to the quality of the Diſeaſe, his Strength, Age, and the Seaſon.</p>

                     <p>In a word, if the Blood be very Red, it is a ſign it is good; if yellow, that it is Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious; if Pale and whiteiſh, that is not well prepared, and that it is charged with phlegm; but if it be livide and greeniſh, that then he is Melancholick and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial.</p>
                     <p>That you may judge of the Quality of Blood after it is received into a Veſſel, you are to ſet it in a place where the Sun may not dry it, and without alſo expoſing it to ſmoke, Wind, or Duſt, or any thing elſe that may be prejudicial to the exact diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                     <p>If Blood will not congeal and fix, it is a ſign that the horſe is full of bad humours, and that he ſtands in need of reiterate Blooding in a ſmall quantity, and to be purged to take away the <hi>Cacochymy,</hi> that is, thoſe corrupt Humors which by their putrefaction over-heat the Blood in the Veins, and thereby are the cauſe of all Diſeaſes, this kind of blood is the worſt of any; neither ſhould ſuch horſes be bled too abundantly at a time, but by degrees and little at once, taking care to purify the blood, after it hath been preceeded by purgatives.</p>
                     <p>When the blood is Viſcuous and thick, and that when you break it with your Fingers, it immediatly rejoins and continues firm having a good colour, then it denotes plenitude, and conſequently that the horſe ſhould be frequently bled.</p>
                     <p>If you would judge of the quality of blood by its taſte, that which is ſweeteſt is the beſt and moſt natural; if it be inſpide it is pituitous and phlegmatick; if bitter, it is Bilious and Cholerick; if it be acid or ſtiptick, it is terreſtrial and Melancholick; but if ſaltiſh, then it betokeneth Brackiſh phlegm.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo good to obſerve, that when horſes ſtand equally in need of blooding and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is fitteſt to begin with bleeding, becauſe it cools, and thereby may hinder the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which is of an over-heating quality, to inflame the Humors; becauſe for the moſt part, a purgative Medicament ſtirreth up Humors which it doth not evacuate, ſo that if you ſhould immediatly take blood while the excited humors are thus in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Veins would preſently attract to themſelves, that ſtirred up humor which was not evacuate, and which being once in the Veins, is capable to ſpoil the reſt of the good blood.</p>
                     <p>In fine, blood-letting contributes much to the giving a Man the true knowledge of a horſe's conſtitution, becauſe it diſcovers his Temperament, and the humor which predomines, more certainly then any other evidence or mark, whether of Colour or any thing elſe; as alſo a man may thereby judge of his inward health and vigour.</p>

                        <q>None of thoſe in France who underſtand horſes, have ever doubted, but that a good Colour prepoſſeſſeth people, with an opinion of a Horſes goodneſs which alſo holds very often, for experience diſcovers daily to us the truth of it; but as a man may come to be deceived by it, ſo he ſhould alwayes joyn it with other things, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarly oblige all people to judge of the goodneſs of a horſe, and then by both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will be better capable to give a more poſitive and certain judgement, than if he ſhould look upon all Colours as equally good.</q>

                     <p>Some people ſay that there was never a good horſe of a bad Colour, meaning thereby, that it matters not much of what Colour a horſe be, ſo he be good; But it is very certain that a good horſe may be of a bad colour, for a Man may have a Coat of a very Rich Velvet, which may be of an ugly and diſagreeable Colour: In fine, I conclude that the Colour is of no great import, however I would rather deſire you ſhould chuſe a Stallion of one of the above mentioned Colours, than of any other, <q>To wit, the <hi>light Bay,</hi> with Mane, Tail, the extremities of the legs, and liſt along the back, all black, having alſo a Star in the fore-head; The <hi>Scarlet</hi> or Cherry-bay, or <hi>Dapled Chaſnut-bay,</hi> either with the near hind-foot only, or both hind-feet white, and a Star in the fore-head; the <hi>Roan</hi> with a Black or Dark coloured Head; the <hi>Black</hi> with a Blaze or Star in the fore-head; the very <hi>Dark dapled Gray,</hi> and the <hi>Sandy Gray,</hi> (which are to be put to Gray or White Mares only) the <hi>Dark ſorrel</hi> with a Star in the fore-head; the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with Mane, Tail, extremities of the legs, and liſt along the Back, all Black, and a Star in the fore-head, all which may paſs for excellent colours for a Stallion; Other Colours are good, but I eſteem thoſe beſt which I have named, becauſe of their agreeableneſs and beauty: You ſee I differ extreamly from the Duke's opinion, but I have alwayes heard the above mentioned Colours moſt eſteemed for Stallions.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>It would be an endleſs work to write of mixed kinds of horſes, becauſe there are ſo very many of them, and ſome of them extraordinary good; Theſe which are ſhort Rein'd and well Coupled, ſeem to be the moſt proper for the Mannage, in reſpect that we endeavour to ſhorten them by Art, for we Stop them, pull them back, and put them Together, to ſet them upon their haunches, therefore a ſhort horſe is ſooner Aſſembled than a long; However I have had many long horſes, which were as good as any ſhort, ſo that that ſignifieth nothing to ſuch perſons who are Maſters of a little Art: Many people ſay, that a horſe Charged in his fore-quarters, that is to ſay, which hath his Head, Neck, and Shoulders big and large, is heavy on the hand, although he be of a light ſize, becauſe he will reſt upon the Bridle hand, as upon a fifth leg, juſt as a Lame perſon leans upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff or Crutch, but in that caſe it is the Farrier which muſt aſſiſt him, for the Rider's Art will be to no purpoſe if he underſtand not <hi>Marſhalry;</hi> Others ſay that a horſe charged in the fore-hand, although very ſound, ſhould yet neceſſarly preſs on the hand, and that upon the contrary, a horſe diſcharged of fleſh before, ſhould be light on the hand, but this is no certain Rule, for I have known horſes almoſt as heavy in the fore-hand as Bulls, which were lighter on the hand, than thoſe which had their fore-quarters extreamly diſcharged; they are therefore the ſtrong or weak Reins, which generally make a good or bad Mouth.</p>
                     <p>The having of which then doth not conſiſt in having the fore Quarters large or ſlender, but only in the ſtrength and goodneſs of the Reins, becauſe the chief thing in our Art of Horſemanſhip, is to put a Horſe upon his haunches, and he who hath good Reins can endure it, and by the ſame means will be light on the hand, whereas if his Reins be weak, he ſuffers ſo much, and is ſo afraid of being ſet upon his haunches, that he will without doubt preſs upon the Bridle-hand to free himſelf of it, or otherwiſe his hinder legs and hams will be ruined and ſpoilt; ſo that one may ſee that they are only the good or bad Reins, which render a Horſe heavy or light on the hand, and not his fore-quarters being much or little charged with fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Methinks I hear ſome ignorant, who maintains that the more ſtrong and firm Reins a Horſe hath, the more difficult he is to be put upon his Haunches; It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed difficult to be performed by an ignorant Horſeman, but moſt eaſy for him who underſtands his buſineſs, in reſpect that Nature furniſheth us in ſuch Horſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to work, whereas in others we have nothing at all; and when a man hath mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereupon to work, it is not the fault of the Horſe, but the pure ignorance and want of Art in the Horſeman, if he ſucceed not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is moſt certain that ſtrong Rein'd Horſes, which have their Strength knit, and bound up as it were, and which are ſtiff and in ſome meaſure want the uſe of their Limbs, are moſt difficult to be Dreſt, that is to ſay, to be Aſſembled and put upon their haunches, becauſe they defend themſelves with their great ſtrength, neither can a man ſupple them, but in a long tract of Time; but when they are once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, as I aſſure you he who hath well comprehended the Dukes Leſſons, will at laſt effectuate by his Method, if he put it exactly in practice, that perſon, I ſay, will make of ſuch Horſes ſomewhat to be admired, becauſe they have a Fund and Reſource, and providing they be well winded, one may ſay that they are good ſtuff and that there is no more required but to make good uſe of it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true ſome Horſes are ſo diſpoſed, that they have always an inclination to leap, in that caſe the Rider ſhould follow their Diſpoſition; but then if he do not put

                     <p>The <hi>Barhs</hi> then, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes, are abſolutely the beſt <hi>Stallions,</hi> for having Horſes for all uſes, as well for a mans own Service as Divertiſement, unleſs it be for the Cart whereof there are already too great a number. <q>That which I have to ſay againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes, is, that they beget Colts of a leſs Size than themſelves, neither do the Mares hold ſo eaſily to them as to the <hi>Barb,</hi> for of ten Mares cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, the one half will not be with Foal, which is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſs in a Breed, whereas they hold ſooner to the <hi>Barb,</hi> providing the Stallions be but ſix years old, for being younger they deceive the Mares.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some people would make us beleive, that the <hi>Barbs</hi> and <hi>Spantiſh</hi> Genets beget too ſmall Colts, in reſpect that Nature daily dryes up and becomes elder; in the firſt place, we in <hi>England</hi> need not fear to have too ſmall Horſes, becauſe the coldneſs and moiſtneſs of the Climate, joined to the great nouriſhing Quality of the Graſs, are the Cauſes why all our Races produce large Horſes.</p>
                     <p>As to what people ſay, that Nature dryes daily up, I beleive that the Sun is as hot at preſent, as it was the firſt moment it was Created, and that the Earth is alſo as fertile; becauſe if nature had alwiſe dried up ſince the Creation, we ſhould be at preſent ſmaller than the Ants, and the poor Ants would have been long ago reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nothing: Therefore I conclude in favours of the <hi>Barbs</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes, as abſolutly the beſt for Stallions. <q>However you are to be warry, not to cauſe cover large Mares with a Stallion of a far leſs ſize than themſelves upon the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Opinion, that a <hi>Barb</hi> being put to large Mares will beget big enough Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; it is true that ſuch Horſes will be high, but their tallneſs will only conſiſt in the Legs, which will be too high above the ground, and their Bodies but very ſmall, which hath been found true by Experience; but above all, ſee that the <hi>Barb</hi> you intend to breed upon, be ſhort jointed, that is to ſay, have ſhort paſterns, having alſo his feet well ſhap't, and proportioned to his Size.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Mares, I ſhould be ſatisfied you would make choice of ſome beautiful <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mares to Breed upon, or ſome out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which are delicatly ſhap't; but if you cannot eaſily procure of theſe, chuſe beautiful <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mares, which will be as good as any, providing they be of a good Colour, and well Marked, which is of as much conſequence to give a good Tincture to your Breed, as the good colour of a Stallion.</p>
                     <p>As to what concerns the giving the Mares the Stallion, I nowiſe approve of the letting them be Covered in ones haud, tying them, and making them faſt with ropes, as if people intended to force them; for this Action of Nature ſhould be performed with freedom and love, and not with reluctancy and againſt their will.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I approve of the obſervation of the Planets, as the Moon and other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bodies; to wit if the Moon be in her Decreaſe or Increaſe, or if the other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies be in ſuch and ſuch a Conjunction, as if Forſooth Colts were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by Aſtronomy, or according to the Almanack.</p>
                     <p>As alſo to obſerve from what Airth or Point the Wind Blows, for to have a Male or Female, or to tye the left Stone of the Stallion to have a Male, and the right to have a Female, or to place a ſheet of ſuch a Colour before the Mare, that ſo ſhe may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Foal of the ſame Colour; all theſe are falſe, and nothing but Foppiſh tricks to amuſe credulous and ſimple People, by cauſeing them believe that there lyeth ſome myſtery in them, that ſo themſelves may be admired as great. Philoſophers, whereas they are nothing elſe, but Trick players at Paſs-paſs.</p>
                     <p>Nature is moſt wiſe in her own Works, amongſt which the greateſt is the Act of Generation, by which ſhe preſerves each Species, thereby to continue it to the end of the World; and we ſee that this wiſe nature is ſo circumſpect in this Action, that although ſhe ſuffer two different kinds to mix by generation, yet that which proceeds therefrom doth not afterwards Generate, nor in the leaſt produce any thing, becauſe were it otherwayes, each true kind or Species would periſh; let us therefore follow herein the Laws of Nature, who is the moſt wiſe in the Act of Generation, ſeing it is ſhe that impoſes it, and not Art.</p>
                     <p>When your Stallion is once well choſen, three Months at leaſt before the time he is to Cover, feed him with good Oats, or good Peaſe or Beans, or with courſe bread and but a little Hay, but a good deal of wheat ſtraw, Stepping him out twice a day to the Water, and after he hath Drunk, walk him up and down an hour without making him ſweat, that ſo you may bring him in Wind, and it ſhould be about two hours every day that he ſhould be thus walked abroad, in ſome pleaſant Field where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he takes delight; if a Stallion were not thus brought in wind before he is made to Cover, he would either become purſey and broken-Winded, or run a great Risk of

                     <p>As for the young Mares which are called <hi>Fillies,</hi> you may ſuffer them to run abroad in the Incloſures untill they be three years old, becauſe they are not ſo ſubject to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too charged with Fleſh (eſpecially in their fore-parts) as Horſes are; however if you have the conveniency of houſing your Fillies in the Winter time as well as your Colts, it will be ſtill ſo much the better, but I am afraid that the charge of it would be too great for any private Gentleman, eſpecially if he have a great number of Stud-Mares: I know certainly by my own experience that this method of breeding horſes is the beſt, for I have tryed all others, and that with the moſt part of Stallions and Mares, which could be had from different Kingdoms: you are to cauſe back and walk abroad your young Mares ſome time before you cauſe Cover them, otherwiſe they will be ſo wild, that they will be in danger of not only ſpoiling themſelves, but their Foals, but being thus Gently backt, and rendered tractable and Familiar, you will prevent that diſorder.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The largeſt Size of Foals, and all kind of tall horſes, that is, which are very high ſet upon their Limbs, ruine and ſpoil their Legs extreamly while they graze in the Fields, or at leaſt turn very much out their Toes, that ſo they may come at the Graſs, and feed upon it with the more eaſe, eſpecially if their Necks be ſhort; people ſhould therefore if they intend to graze ſuch horſes, give them their Graſs cut in the Stable, which will prevent this imperfection of turning out their Toes.</p>
                        <p>Without pretending to contradict the Duke, I have found by experience, that for having weaned Colts at the time which he appoints, and for having taken them from their Dames at the beginning of Winter, at a time in which they are to change their green food to dry, and tender to bard, (for at the ſame time that they are taken from the graſs and put in the ſtable, about the very ſame time they are to be weaned from the Pap,) this great change and privation of Milk hath been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them, and made them ſo very lean, that they had difficulty the whole next Summer to recover it; it ſeems therefore a great deal more reaſonable to me (eſpecially ſeing their Dames are not to be covered till next Spring) to let them Suck the whole Winter, for which they will certainly be the better, becauſe their mouths being as yet tender, find difficulty in chawing Hay, and therefore they eat but little of it; it is true that to make up that want, the Duke orders to give them Wheat-Bran and Oats, which he pretends is ſufficientto ſupply the want of Milk; but ſeing the Mare will be uſeleſs all Winter (for I ſuppoſe ſhe is neither to be made uſe of for Carriage, nor any other ſervice, but only for Breeding) is it not a great deal more proper to let the Foal Suck, untill it be accuſtomed with a dry and hard kind of Food? I herein ſubmit my ſelf to the Readers Judgement, who is free to chuſe which he ſhall think beſt, that ſo he may ſucceed in his deſign.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This is what I have taken from the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Book, which I wiſh may prove uſeful to you, and that in France, where they may bring up as beautiful and fine Horſes as in any part of the World, People would with Emulation put this in practice, that ſo they might reeſtabliſh thoſe Races and good Breeds of Horſes, which have been ruined by troubleſome times; and that without going to ſeek for horſes at exceſſive rates in forreign Countries, they would Breed them up in this, ſeeing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the good French Hunters and Gallopers are, when well choſen, preferable to any horſes in the World, becauſe they have more Reſource, more ſtrength, and laſt longer than any Outlandiſh horſes whatſoever. Before the year 1600, People made no uſe of Engliſh horſes in France, and the Mode then was ſtoned Curtailes, ſo that <hi>Henry the Great</hi> made uſe of them in the Wars, at Hunting, and for all other uſes; untill one called <hi>Quinteret</hi> an Engliſh man, brought over with him ſome horſes to Court (where they delight more in Novelties then any where elſe in the World) after which the uſe of them was brought ſo much in Fashion, that the People of quality thought not themſelves well mounted, if they were not upon English Horſes, becauſe they did not find their own Country Horſes beautiful and fine enough for their Service, and that by reaſon of the deſtruction of the Races in <hi>France:</hi> In England they take great care of their Breeds, and the French pay them ſufficiently for this trouble, by buying their Horſes at a very dear rate, among which as well as elſewhere there are a great many Jads, although to tell the real truth, there are ſome Engliſh Horſes, which are excellent and very agreeable, but they are not all ſo; and thus much of raiſing a true Breed of Horſes.</p>

                     <p>The Curb is alſo proportioned according to the deſign a man hath of bringing in, or Raiſing a Horſe's head; it is compoſed of two long hooks, one whereof is faſtned to the eye of the Branch, of Rings or Mallions, and Links or large Eſſes. See Plat. 3. Fig. 12. and 14.</p>
                     <p>As I have ſaid that a Mouth had it's ſides, ſo are they either Round or Canon'd, Scatcht, and after the form of a Barge, or otherwiſe compoſed of Olives, Little Drums, ſmall Bells, Pears, little Balls, Melons, little Rings, Pater-noſters and many others now out of Faſhion; the forms of ſeveral whereof you may ſee in Plate 2.</p>

                        <p>I find it of good uſe for Falſe-mouths, that is, which having high Barrs, yet have them not very ſenſible, for if people ſhould give to ſuch Horles, Bit-mouths which are below the line of the Barrs, they would turn them deſperate, ſo that they would draw no more obedience from the uſe of ſuch Bit-mouths, than from theſe Olives, which are pleaſant to the Horſe, only becauſe they are moveable; of old people were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Bit-mouths with Olives, were (becauſe of their turning) more gentle than Canon mouths, which without giving the lye to Antiquity, they are not, becauſe they diſcharge the Barrs of the lips, are beneath the line of the Barrs, and alſo diſ-engage the Tongue, ſo that with all this, it is impoſſible they can be ſo gentle as round or Canon mouths.</p>

                        <p>In the time of <hi>Mr De la Brow,</hi> and <hi>Mr Pluvinel,</hi> people were not ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in not giving rude Bits to Horſes, becauſe there was ſeen in the Riding Schools in thoſe days, Bit-mouths with <hi>Pears,</hi> little <hi>Balls, Melons,</hi> and alſo <hi>à Genette;</hi> theſe kind of people did not then want Art, whereby to keep their Horſes under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the aſſiſtance of good Leſſons, but their Branches were ſo weak, that they were neceſſitate to have ſuch rude Mouths to keep their Horſes in ſubjection; at preſent people have altered this method, for they have forſaken all theſe kind of weak Branches, as being too feeble for producing any good effect, and have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in their places more ſtrong and hardy ones, and gentler Mouths, ſo that a weak Branch is not now to be ſeen, becauſe all are ſtrong and hardy, in like manner there is no rude Bit-mouths to be ſeen as formerly, becauſe people ſeldom exceed the ſimple Canon and Scatch mouths for good Horſes; that which may be ſaid, of their fortifying in theſe latter times the Bridle, by means of the Branch, is, that the horſe's Beard ſuffereth much thereby, becauſe there is a neceſſity that the Curb work with more violence; but then it is more juſt to preſerve the inner parts of the mouth, which are a great deal ſooner hurt, and more ſubject to be cut than the Beard, which is covered with a skin, more capable to reſiſt than that of the Barrs, befides that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can Quilt or line their Curbs, and alſo in caſe of neceſſity make uſe of a ſmall ſtring or Ribband.</p>

                        <p>Horſes are neither very Heavy on the Hand, nor Preſs it much when their Mouths are fine and delicate, for in that caſe, they will be more apt to Chack or beat on the Hand, than to reſt on it.</p>
                        <p>There are few Cut-ſhort Scatch-mouths to be ſeen, but they may be made after the ſame faſhion as Canon-mouths which are cut ſhort: This Bit is for a horſe which hath a very bad Mouth, low Barrs, a big Tongue, who Arms himſelf with his Lips, and which with all theſe hath alſo his mouth enough cloven, all which being joyned together, produces an <hi>Appuy</hi> which will either force the Rider's hand, when any thing extraordinary is required of the horſe, or be heavy on it when he is travelling.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Pears are called <hi>Secret,</hi> becauſe their Liberty is kneed inwards, that is, that the <hi>Pas d'aſne</hi> which joynes them, in ſtead of riſeing high againſt the Palate to offend it, inclines inwards in its middle, which produceth a very good effect, becauſe of it's not tickling the abovementioned Palate, which would make the horſe either beat on the Hand, or carry low, to free himſelf of the trouble it occaſions.</p>
                        <p>As for the reſt, this Bit is Rude, and keeps a horſe Subject; People find few of theſe Bit-mouths ready made, but however they are good, and although they coſt dear, yet when they fit a horſe exactly, they may be accounted Cheap.</p>

                        <p>They are proper for horſes which have abominable Mouths, fleſhy Barrs depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all ſenſibility, a big Tongue, and who alſo Arm their Barrs with their Lips, together with an <hi>Appuy</hi> which we term <hi>Deſperate,</hi> that is, which we are out of hopes of rendring Light.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Pears are much uſed for ſtrong, thick, and will knit ſtoned Dutch Horſes, whoſe Mouths have theſe fine and excellent Qualities, I have juſt now explained; as for their effect, it hath been ſo often repeated, that the Reader cannot but be fully informed of it, and therefore it would be almoſt as great a trouble for him to Read, as for me to write it.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Balls are for a horſe which hath a bad Mouth, a fleſhy Palate, low Barrs a big Tongue and thick Lips; But becauſe the Liberty <hi>à Pas d'aſne,</hi> might if it were too high Tickle his Palate, eſpecially if it were fleſhy, and ſo cauſe him to carry low, or beat on the Hand, therefore is it that people make uſe of theſe Balls, with the Liberty fixed to them after the ſame manner as in the <hi>Secret Pears,</hi> ſeeing both of them have the very ſame effects, but this is the Ruder of the two.</p>

                        <p>It is certainly a kind of Martyrdome for brave Horſes, when people Bit them with Pears, becauſe there are ſome who although their Horſes have good Mouths, yet if they have ardor or fieryneſs, or that they cannot be reſtrained or ſtopt, (more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps through ignorance then want of a good mouth) they immediatly Bit them with Pears, which in a very ſhort time turns their Mouths deſperate.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:179659:150"/>not made to reſt upon the Barrs, becauſe they are more than two Inches diſtant from other, which is contrary to all good method; becauſe every thing that is to reſt upon the Barrs, ſhould not be further diſtant than an inch, or an inch and a half at moſt.</p>
                        <p>This Bit hath been invented for Horſes which have no more feeling in their Barrs, either for having them ill ſhapt, or becauſe of ſome Calloſities or hardneſſes which have been occaſioned by a former Bit, or for having ſome of the bones broke; There is therefore a neceſſity to find out a new <hi>Appuy,</hi> at the Bottom of the Gums, where the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It is eaſily diſcovered, that this Bit is not proper for a Horſe which hath a good mouth, ſeing it is ordained for ſuch as have no more feeling in their Barrs, and which feeling muſt therefore be ſought for at the bottom of the Gums; the greateſt difficulty is ſo to adjuſt it, as it may reſt exactly upon thoſe parts of the Gums you deſign, obſerving alwiſe to make the Liberty wider than I have ordered, if the diſtance between the Horſe's barrs be larger than ordinary.</p>

                           <hi>Mr. de la Brow</hi> has given us the Figure of it in his book of Horſemanſhip, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tells, that he made uſe of one of a much odder ſhape, becauſe inſtead of Pears, he had Wheels, and made uſe of them for a horſe which had no <hi>Appuy,</hi> and could ſuffer nothing either upon his Barrs or elſewhere: Horſes now a-dayes would find difficulty in reliſhing ſuch a Bit, I mean ſuch whoſe mouths are ſo delicate and tender, that they cannot endure the leaſt preſſure of a Bit.</p>

                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:179659:151"/>immediatly turns backwards ſo ſoon as it meets with the Palate, and ſo cannot trouble or hurt it, therefore the Pears being ſupported by nothing, find out and reach the Barrs, and excites their feeling, let it be never ſo dull, and becauſe they are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, their effects are thereby rendered more Gentle; That which may be objected againſt this Bit is its great price, and that there are few Bit-makers capable to make it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>IT remains that I diſcourſe of the <hi>Genette</hi> or Bit <hi>à la Turque,</hi> which hath been of a long time much out of Faſhion in <hi>France,</hi> but a while agoe hath again come in Mode, ſo that ſeveral People at Court make uſe of them; People may ſometimes alſo ſee ſome Buſtard Bits <hi>à Genette,</hi> whoſe branches are after our own Faſhion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are ſo very ſcarce, that few Bit-makers know to make them; People made much uſe of them in Mr <hi>Pluvinel</hi> and Mr <hi>De la Brow's</hi> time, and I look upon them to be good, but very difficult to be adjuſted to a Horſe; they have no Curbs faſtned to the eye of the Branch as ours have, but it is at the very top of the Liberty to which it is faſtned, being all of one piece, and which coming over the lower part of the Horſe's Mouth, reſts it ſelf upon the ordinary place of the Curb.</p>
                        <p>This Bit keeps Horſes very ſubject, and People make more uſe of them in Turky than in this Kingdom, becauſe theſe People wanting Art, whereby to keep their Horſe's under obedience by the help of good Leſſons, they have therefore recourſe to rude Bits, amongſt which this <hi>à Genette,</hi> although baſtardized, may take place.</p>
                        <p>Here are in ſhort the effects of all the Bit-mouths made uſe of at preſent, but the laſt as being moſt rude are very little uſed, becauſe People now a-dayes give rarely ruder Bits to Horſes, than <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Scatch</hi> Mouths; and I aſſure you, that any Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who cannot dreſs a Horſe with a <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Scatch</hi> Mouth, will never dreſs him with any other kind of Bit Whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>It is to be remarked, that I have in theſe inſtructions placed all the Bits according to their degrees of rudeneſs, having firſt ſet down and told the effects of thoſe Bits which are moſt Gentle, and afterwards the reſt according to their Rank, ſo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may judge of the ſtrength or weakneſs of a Bit, by conſidering where it is placed.</p>
                        <p>The Bit-mouths here deſcribed are aboundantly ſufficient, without enquiring after a vaſt number of others made uſe of by the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and which ſerve for nothing elſe but to ſpoyl Horſes mouths; becauſe Bits ſought after with ſo much Artifice and Workmanſhip about them, are a ſufficient token that the Rider hath but little Art, whereby to render his Horſe Obedient.</p>
                        <p>One of the greateſt Secrets for keeping a Horſe light on the hand,<note place="margin">An excellent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the Bridle-hand.</note> is to yeeld or ſlaken the Bit frequently to him, becauſe when a man keeps a Horſe long at a time firm on the hand, the Bic-mouth reſts ſo hard upon his Barrs, that it makes the Blood and Spirits which are the cauſe of their Senſibility, to retire, ſo that if a man ſlacken ſometimes his hand, the Bit thereby not reſting upon the Barrs, his ſence of Feeling will immediatly return, whereas if the Bit ſhould be kept alwiſe firm, the place of <hi>Appuy</hi> in the Barrs would continue inſenſible, that let a man pull the Reins, as hard and ſo long as he pleaſes, yet it will not oblige the Horſe to obey.</p>
                        <p>But upon the contrary having ſlackned it, and the ſenſibility of the Barrs returning, ſo ſoon as ever he again pulls the Reins, it will oblige the Horſe to obey as much as he can, and ſo he will remain both lighter on the hand, and have alſo his mouth more freſh, whereas if he ſhould keep the Bit, as I ſaid, alwiſe firm, the very contrary would happen; a man ſhould therefore yeeld or ſlacken his hand as frequently as he can to all kinds of Horſes, and by this means he will draw ſome obedience from them; when ſuch as cleave to the Bridle Reins will draw from them none at all.</p>

                     <p>THe Branch is the ſecond part of that Diviſion,<note place="margin">CHAP. LXXXII Of Branches.</note> we made in the beginning of our inſtructions for Bitting, where we told its effect was to place a Horſe's head and neck, and that it was to be proportioned, according to the deſign a man hath of either bringing in, or raiſing a Horſe's head.</p>
                     <p>The Branch is not the firſt Cauſe that acts in the placing a Horſe's head and neck, for it is only a ſecond, or help to the Bit-mouth; becauſe as a Bit-mouth hath no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but by means of the ſenſibility that is in a Horſe's mouth, and that that ſentiment is awakned no other way but by the Bit-mouth, it follows that to make uſe of that ſenſibility, there is a neceſſity that the Branch Cooperate with the Bit-mouth, and but only as a ſecond Cauſe, to produce thoſe effects which we know it doeth, by giving ſo beautiful a poſture to Horſes, and obliging them to carry in the moſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture, whereof Nature hath made them capable.</p>
                     <p>The line of the Banquet, is that part of the branch whereby we judge of its effects, and which diſcovers to us its ſtrength or weakneſs; See <hi>plat.</hi> 3 <hi>Fig.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrong or hardy Branch, is that whoſe Sevill-hole at the lower end of it, is plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the outſide of the line of the Banquet, <hi>See Plat.</hi> 3 <hi>Fig</hi> 4.5. &amp; 8. and the <hi>Flaque</hi> or Gentle, which hath it placed upon this ſide of the above-mentioned Line, <hi>See Plat,</hi> 3 <hi>Fig.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>A Rude and hardy Branch will bring in a Horſe's head, proportionably as it is more or leſs hardy, and the <hi>Flaque</hi> or Gentle cannot operate but by its weakneſs, thereby diminiſhing the effect of the Bit-mouth, and ſo cauſing a Horſe more eaſily ſuffer the <hi>Appuy</hi> or Preſſure of the Bit, who before had difficulty to endure it.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary effect of a Branch, is to bring in a Horſe's head, that is the Action moſt natural to it, becauſe the further it is from a Horſe's Neck, the greater ſtrength will it have in pulling, and therefore that which is moſt hardy, will bring beſt in, provided it be in the hands of a Perſon who underſtands to make uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>A Branch may alſo raiſe a horſe's head, but then it ſhall be never but betwixt the Ham and Sevill-hole, that it will have this Operation, and that by reaſon of the Bent or turn that is given to it in that part, for it is not the name of a Branch that cauſeth it either bring in or raiſe a Horſe's head, but only the Turn or ſhape that is given to its lower parts.</p>
                     <p>Short Branches are ruder then long, if they have both of them the ſame ſhape and turn, becauſe as the effects of a long Branch cometh from a pretty diſtance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it does not conſtrain a horſe ſo upon a ſudden as a ſhort, which beſides it's great conſtraint is alſo unpleaſant. I ſhall give a deſcription of all the Branches, which are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179659:154"/>of moſt uſe for the right briding of horſes, and in explaining the effects of each Branch in particular, ſhall at the ſame time diſcourſe of all thoſe parts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one, without ſpeaking ſeparately of each, and thereby making a long diſcourſe, which proves many times as troubleſome as uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>It is difficult enough at firſt ſeing of a horſe to chuſe a proper Branch for him, it being much harder than to appoint a Mouth, becauſe a Bit-mouth may be both ſeen and felt, and People have a certain meaſure for its bigneſs, but it is not ſo with a Branch, becauſe it muſt be proportion'd to the length of a horſe's Neck; however one may ſooner fail in ordering a too ſhort, than too long a Branch; I fancy that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering exactly the Models I am to give a man can ſcarcely fail, but that ſo ſoon as he ſees a Branch, he will be capable to tell that it is for a horſe which hath ſuch a Neck, and that when he ſees how any horſe carries his head, he will he alſo immediatly able to diſcover, that ſuch a Branch is proper for him, becauſe he carries ſo and ſo, and hath ſuch a Neck.</p>

                        <p>This faſhion of ſtreight Branch, reſtrains a horſe a great deal leſs than one having a ſhoulder, and it is alwiſe the Method ſhould be obſerved in beginning a young horſe, to conſtrain him as little as poſſible, that ſo there may be no occaſion given him to reſiſt, whereby he may ſhun that conſtraint, which is diſpleaſing to him; for of all the Chaſtiſements and Remedies wherewith Art furniſhes us, there are none leſs natural than the effects of a Bridle, and conſequently very difficult to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Horſes.</p>
                        <p>People commonly for the very ſame reaſon make Branches pretty long, to the end, firſt, that they may give no diſpleaſure or trouble to the horſe, and next, becauſe a long and gentle Branch, ſuch as this, in a manner brings a horſe who hath a mouth too tender and delicate, to endure a hard and firm hand, and alſo aſſiſts and ſupports him, in the action of Stopping, without ſuffering him to precipitate his force for that purpoſe, becauſe this Branch comes eaſily to his Counter; ſo that both his Mouth and Barrs are thereby eaſed,</p>
                        <p>This Branch may ſerve to bring in or raiſe a horſe's Head, according as the Curb is either lengthned or ſhortned: theſe two effects 'tis true, will not be performed with the ſame eaſe and advantage, wherewith they are by Branches, whoſe ſhoulders and other ſhapes are particularly deſigned for that purpoſe; but becauſe this Branch is that which muſt gain a horſe's conſent with eaſe and pleaſure, therefore People commonly make uſe of no other, untill this hath firſt ſomewhat habituate him to them.</p>
                        <p>This Branch is commonly joined to a ſimple Canon Mouth; for as that Mouth is the moſt gentle of all Bit-mouths, therefore is it joined with this Branch, which as I have ſaid is alſo moſt Gentle; but if you horſe, becauſe of his having a too ſenſible, tender or tickliſh mouth, will not ſuffer the preſſure of a Canon ſimple, becauſe of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:179659:154"/>the inequality of its <hi>Appuy,</hi> which renders ſuch horſes uncertain, then you are to join to this Branch a Mouth <hi>à Trompe,</hi> which will bring the horſe to a firm <hi>Appuy,</hi> eſpecially being aſſiſted by a good hand, and the judicious conduct of a skilful Rider.</p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne Branche à la Conestable:</hi> See Plat. 3. Fig. 2.</p>
                        <p>THis <hi>Branch à la Coneſtable,</hi> Or <hi>after the Duke of Mommorancy Conſtable of France his faſhion,</hi> is round, as thoſe will have it who underſtand not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to good Work; for there is no cut work upon round Branches, as people make them now a-days, ſo that a good Workman cannot thereupon ſhow his skill; it is left to every one to pleaſe their own fancy, but as to my own particular, round Branches ſeem very ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>This Branch is upon the line of the <hi>Banquet,</hi> and ſo will be proper for a horſe which naturally carries his head well, and in as becomeing a poſture as poſſibly he can; for without much Philoſophy, a horſe that Carries exactly well, ſhould have alwiſe given to him a Branch upon the line of the <hi>Banquet,</hi> becauſe it is to no purpoſe to ſubject him by the means of a firm Branch, if he immediatly yeeld what is required of him, by one that is more gentle.</p>
                        <p>This Branch may be adjuſted or join'd to any Bit-mouth a man pleaſes, but as its uſe is to preſerve a horſe in his naturally beautiful Poſture, there is appearance that his mouth is good, and therefore, for the moſt part you are not to join any other Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth to it, but a ſimple Canon or Scatch; however it is not but when you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged for certain Reaſons, to give your horſe a rude Mouth, you may join to it this Branch, only with a deſign to weaken or diminiſh the ſtrength of the Bit-mouth; for it is a Maxim, that a man may either ſtrengthen or weaken the effects of a Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, by means of the Branch.</p>
                        <p>From whence it follows, that a man can give to a horſe either a rude or gentle Branch, without any intention of either bringing in, or raiſing his head, but only of fortifying or weakning the operation of the Bit-mouth.</p>
                        <p>What I have here ſaid ſhall not be repeated, leſt it ſhould trouble the Reader, and therefore he is to apply it to all Branches whatſoever.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Branche à Gigotte,</hi> Or <hi>Branch after the form of a Gigot or Leg, and pretty well kneed, and alſo bruiſed forwards at the Jarret or Ham,</hi> is upon the line of the Banquet; but as it is hardy the matter of ſixteen lines, or an inch and four lines at the Ham, and that it is alſo bruiſed or ſet forwards by a falſe Ham, therefore it will be proper for Horſes which naturally carry well; and as ſuch horſes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:179659:155"/>many times either through the weakneſs of their Reins, or wearineſs, may come to fall from ſuch a beautiful Carriage, and even to carry low, therefore I fancied this Branch would be proper for ſuch, in reſpect, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it is upon the Line of the Banquet, and therefore capable to maintain them in their good Carriage; And <hi>Secondly,</hi> The hardineſs or ſtrength of it at the Ham, together with the help of its falſe Ham, will raiſe their heads, in caſe they have either of theſe imperfections I mentioned.</p>
                        <p>I alſo think that a man can commit no great fault, in giving a horſe who has his head naturally well placed, this Branch which we call <hi>à Gigotte,</hi> becauſe he may come of this Branch will oblige him to continue in his becoming poſture; this Branch may be joined to a gentle Bit-mouth, for the very ſame Reaſons I gave in diſcourſing of the preceeding Branch; and People commonly join it to Canon or Scatch-mouths.</p>
                        <p>It is not but that there are horſes who have naturally their Heads and Necks well enough placed, and yet have bad and hard Mouths, and who therefore require a firm Bit to ſtop and conduct them; in this caſe you are not to heſitate, but to give immediatly a Bit conform to the inward parts of the Mouth, and diſpoſition of the Horſe, who perhaps may afterwards diſcover, that his mouth is only bad through too great Ardour, or an exceſſive deſire to go forwards; to ſuch a horſe as this, a rude Bit would produce no other effect but the ruine of his Mouth.</p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ue Branche à Genouil;</hi> See Plat: 3. Fig. 4.</p>
                        <p>THis <hi>Branche à Genouil,</hi> Or <hi>Branch very much kneed at the Jarret. or Ham, after the Form of a beut knee,</hi> is after the model of thoſe Branches which raiſe a Horſe's head, and is proper for horſes which Arm themſelves againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Bit, ſo that I cannot recommend to you a better for that purpoſe; it appears at firſt view ridiculous, being of an extraordinary ſhape, but it is it alone hath diſcovered to us, that there was no other means to raiſe a horſe's head, but by the help of a hardy Branch, although it be only between the Ham and Sevill-hole that it raiſeth; the <hi>Touret</hi> or Sevill-hole being placed upon the outſide of the Line of the Banquet, it therefore follows that the Branch is hardy, and yet notwithſtaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, it alſo Raiſeth.</p>
                        <p>This Branch is only hardy a few Lines at the lower end of the Branch, but at the Ham it is full three Inches hardy, and that to give ſtrength enough to the lower part of the Branch to Raiſe, ſo that it will be proper for a horſe which arms himſelf after either of the manners I ſhall immediatly explain; horſes Arm themſelves moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for having their necks too ſlender and eaſie, which they make uſe of to ſhun the ſubjection of the Bit, by bringing in ſo very much their heads, that the lower parts of the Branches reſt upon their Counters, which renders any effect that the Bit can produce in their mouths altogether uſeleſs, becauſe there is no action of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that can force a horſe to thruſt out his noſe directly as they can bring it in, for all Branches can do this, but none that.</p>
                        <p>Till now there hath never been ſound any thing of better uſe for ſuch horſes as Arm themſelves, than the Branch <hi>à Genouil;</hi> I ſhall explain two ways how horſes Arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the <hi>Firſt</hi> is as I have already told, by reſting the Branches againſt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the common remedy is to give to ſuch ſhorter Branches, which are ſo far from rectifying it, that upon the contrary it conſtrains them more, and thereby obliges them to arm themſelves more ſtrongly after this manner, than they did at firſt, and if there ſhould be long Branches given them, then they could not be reſtrained or kep't in; people are therefore neceſſitate to have recourſe to this Branch <hi>à Gonouil,</hi> which
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:179659:155"/>although pretty long, yet is ſo turned that it cannot ſo ſoon reach their Counters, as an ordinary Branch which is but ſix Inches long, (meaſuring from the lower part of the Bit-mouth to the <hi>Touret</hi> or Sevill-hole) becauſe inſtead of pulling down their Noſes, as other Branches generally do, this raiſes them, and yet it is ten inches long, ſo that one would think, that for this reaſon it would reach ſooner their Counters, whereas it doth no ſuch thing, and that by reaſon of its great bent at the Ham.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> way of horſes Arming themſelves, is that when a man would reſtrain them, they turn in ſo very much their Heads, that they immediatly touch their Necks with their Chins, and thereby render the effects of the Branches uſeleſs; there is no other remedy for ſuch, but to place a ball of wood (covered with Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, or any other thing to make it appear neat) betwixt their Jaw-bones, upon the Chaul-band of the Bridle; this is an Invention left to us by Mr. <hi>de la Brow,</hi> which is certainly the only Remedy can be made uſe of with beſt ſucceſs for this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>The bigneſs of this Ball ſhould be proportioned according to the hollow between the upper parts of the Jaws, becauſe were it too little, it would remain altogether uſeleſs and without effect, being wholly lodged between the two Jaw bones, and if it were too big, beſides that it would appear too much, it would alſo ſhift from one ſide to the other, and ſo be frequently diſlodged, but being ſo adjuſted, that the half of the Ball may enter between the two Jaw-bones, and the other half remain without, and meet with his Throat, it will then keep in its place, by reaſon that the hollow betwixt the two Jaw-bones ſtraitens as it deſcends ſo that the Ball cannot therefore be diſlodged, but muſt of neceſſity prevent the horſe's Arming himſelf.</p>
                        <p>5 <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne Branche Françoiſe.</hi> See Plat. 3. Fig. 5.</p>
                        <p>ALL Horſes do not Arm themſelves, but many carry low, therefore the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horſe's head is one of the moſt difficult things we undertake, becauſe a man may bring in a hundred, when he will not raiſe ſo much as one; however the two Branches I am to deſcribe after other will perform this effect, the one more, the other leſs.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt is the <hi>Branche Françoiſe,</hi> or Branch after the French Faſhion, which is hardy about four Lines at the <hi>Touret</hi> or <hi>Sevill-hole,</hi> and kneed an Inch and nine Lines at the <hi>Jarret</hi> or Ham, with the Eye of the Branch a little higher than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to give the more force to the Branch, which is but a very little hardy; it will therefore be proper for raiſing a horſe which carries his head low, becauſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill at the lower end of the Branch, inclining backwards towards the neck, hath borrowed a ſufficient ſtrength from the Ham, which is pretty much kneed in that part, to make it the more powerful for Raiſing.</p>
                        <p>This Philoſophy will not be approved of by every one, becauſe it hath been but little underſtood till of late, and people had difficulty to conceive how a hardy Branch could raiſe a horſe's head; but ſeing it is a matter of Fact, which is agreeable to reaſon (and although it were not, yet clear Matters of Fact are not to be debated) I ſhall explain how this may come to paſs; The greateſt and moſt ſenſible effect of a Branch is from the Shoulder to the Ham, but from the Ham to the Sevill it is not ſo great; now in this Branch the Shoulder hath ſtrength enough of it ſelf, and which is more, it continues its ſtrength to the very Ham, again the lower part of the Branch or Sevill ſerves it ſelf advantagiouſly of this ſtrength, for raiſing a horſe's head, by inclining backwards towards the neck, where however it is hardy, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains about four Lines upon the outſide of the Line of the Banquet, ſo that our Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill holds good, that hardy Branches help to Raiſe a horſe's head.</p>

                        <p>6 <hi>Another Branch</hi> à la Coneſtable, <hi>but which is more hardy than the preceeding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>See Plat: 3. Fig. 6.</p>
                        <p>HOrſes carry their Heads differently, and ſo conſequently their necks; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before propoſed the <hi>Branche Françoiſe,</hi> or Branch after the French faſhion, whoſe effect is to raiſe, although but little, becauſe it is only hardy at the Sevill about the matter of four Lines, whereas this Branch <hi>à la Coneſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> (or after the Duke of <hi>Mommorancy</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France</hi> his faſhion) is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more hardy, having eight Lines at the Sevill Hole, and about two Inches at the Ham, therefore it will be proper to raiſe a horſe's head which carrieth it very low; the falſe Ham, or part of the Branch which is bruiſed or advanced forwards, more than the other part of the Branch to which it is Soldered, is a great help to it, becauſe it augments the ſtrength of the lower part of the Branch, the Eye being of a good height, will alſo give ſtrength to the operation of the Branch, and the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is ſo turned as not to conſtrain too much, will likewiſe aſſiſt the Branch to Raiſe.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe it is moſt difficult to raiſe a horſe's head which inclines to carry low, I have therefore propoſed three Branches for it; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is that <hi>à la Gigotte,</hi> mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 3d. which although it be only upon the Line of the Banquet, and that it appears to be fit for nothing elſe, but to preſerve a horſe in a good Carriage, yet as it is hardy at the Ham, it will therefore in ſome meaſure Raiſe:</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is the Branch <hi>à la Françoiſe,</hi> marked 5th. which raiſes more than the preceeding, becauſe it is its proper effect, but however with a great deal of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it is only hardy at the Sevill-hole, the matter of four Lines, although the reſt of its parts be very well proportioned for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is this <hi>à la Coneſtable</hi> I have been deſcribing, which will yet raiſe more than the other two, becauſe all its other proportions being exactly obſerved, it is alſo hardy at the Sevll Hole, the matter of 8 Lines; it may be made to raiſe yet a great deal more, by kneeing or advancing the Ham, the double of the diſtance wherewith it is made hardy at the Sevill Hole; the very ſame may be done with the preceeding Branch.</p>
                        <p>7 <hi>Another Branche</hi> à la Gigotte, <hi>but which brings in a Horſe's Head more than the preceeding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>See Plat. 3. Fig. 7.</p>
                        <p>BEcauſe Horſes have different ways of carrying their Heads and Necks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to rectify theſe imperfections, there muſt be made uſe of Branches whoſe Tours and Bents are alſo different; this <hi>à la Gigotte,</hi> is hardy the matter of eight Lines at the Sevill Hole, and hath a falſe Ham, that is, the Branch at that part is bruiſed or ſet forwards, ſo that the moſt advanced part of this Branch is about an Inch and nine Lines.</p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:179659:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>The principal effect of this Branch is to bring in, it being hardy to the very lower part or Sevill-hole; the half Ham augments its ſtrength, and the lower part of the Branch which ſtands inclined towards the horſe's Neck, maketh it to Raiſe a little, ſo that it will be good for a horſe which Carrieth his Neck ſtreight out, and hath therefore difficulty to bring in his head to ſuch a becoming poſture as it ought.</p>
                        <p>This Branch brings in a great deal and raiſes but little, which is juſt what we ſhould make uſe of for ſuch ſtreight ſtreached Necks, becauſe by bringing their Heads very much in, we oblige them to turn and bend their ſtreight Necks after the form of an <hi>Arch;</hi> but becauſe it would be dangerous to bring them too much in, and thereby bring their Heads betwixt their legs, therefore the lower part of the Branch is made to incline Backwards towards the horſe's Neck, which raiſes and places their Heads in the moſt beautiful poſture ſuch Necks are capable of; However it is not but that the ſame kind of Branch, may be made uſe of for horſes which only thruſts out their Noſes, as I ſhall hereafter explain.</p>
                        <p>8 <hi>Another Branch à</hi> la Françoiſe, <hi>but which is more Hardy than the preceeding;</hi> See plat 3. Fig. 8.</p>
                        <p>WE have gone through a part of the different kinds of Necks, and Branches which ſhould be made uſe of, to prevent the Actions theſe Necks cauſe to be performed by horſes Heads, it now remains that we conſider the effects of this <hi>Branche Françoiſe,</hi> or Branch after the French faſhion; It is hardy about an Inch and two lines, which is 14. lines; its principal operation is to Bring in, being almoſt equally hardy both at the Ham and ſevill-hole, ſo that it will be proper for horſes which carry their Heads high enough, but yet Thruſt out their Noſes, becauſe as there is nothing required but to bring ſuch Heads in, this Branch will have therefore ſtrength enough to perform it: If a man make good uſe of his legs as he is pulling in hard a horſe's Head, there are very few horſes but what he will oblige to bring down their Noſes.</p>
                        <p>It is not, but that the preceeding Branch <hi>à la Gigotte</hi> may be proper for producing the ſame effect, for although the lower part of that Branch incline backwards towards the horſe's Neck, ſo that it cannot be called purely hardy, becauſe it alſo thereby Raiſes a little, yet that doth not hinder its effect of bringing in; Therefore all that can be ſaid of it, is only that it is weaker, and not ſo capable to reſtrain and bring in a horſe's Head as this laſt.</p>
                        <p>Here are explained all the different wayes which horſes carry their Necks, ſo that;</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Branch is generally proper for the Necks of all Horſes, which are but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Rid; It may be alſo very good in particular, for ſuch horſes as have ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Necks, or which have difficulty to endure the Preſſure of the Bit.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is for horſes which Naturally carry well.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> for ſuch as have a beautiful Carriage, but which incline, either for lack of ſtrength, or out of a bad cuſtom, to carry low.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fourth,</hi> for horſes which Arm themſelves againſt their Counter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fifth,</hi> for horſes which carry low.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sixt,</hi> for ſuch as carry yet lower than the preceeding.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Seventh,</hi> for Necks which ſtand Streached out ſtreight forwards; and</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eight,</hi> for Horſes which carry their Necks high enough, but yet Thruſt out their Noſes, like to the <hi>Cravats.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:179659:157"/>
                        <p>Theſe are all the different wayes, that horſes commonly carry either their Heads, or Necks, together with the Branches which are proper for them.</p>
                        <p>It remains that I diſcourſe of ſuch Necks as are too ſlender, and whoſe Mouths will not endure the preſſure of the Bit upon their Barrs, nor conſequently any thing of a firm hand; I told you that the firſt Branch <hi>à Piſtolet,</hi> was proper for ſuch horſes; but as people have no fancy for giveing ſuch Branches to Journey-pads, they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that caſe take the ſixt Branch <hi>à Coneſtable,</hi> and render it more <hi>Flaque</hi> or gentle at the Sevill-hole by half an inch, which will make it proper for ſuch horſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being made after this faſhion it will have no kind of hardyneſs or ſtrength, which is what we deſire; as for the length, it muſt, as I have already ſaid, be proportioned to the length of the horſe's Neck, and to the deſign you have of reſtraining much or little: And for their turns or bents at the Ham, you are alſo to alter them according to the intention you have of making them hardy or gentle. <hi>Note</hi> that the further the Sevill-hole is without the line of the Banquet, the hardyer and ſtronger the Branch is, and the more it approacheth, or even cometh on this ſide the line of the Banquet, it is ſo much the more <hi>Flaque</hi> or gentle.</p>

                     <p>THe knowledge of the effects of the Bit-mouths and Branches I have deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">CHAP. LXXXIII How to fit a Horſe with a proper Bit.</note> being ſuppoſed, it is eaſie enough to Chuſe, or appoint a proper Bit for any horſe whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>You are then to put a Bit into the horſe's Mouth you are about to Bit, for without doeing this, it is impoſſible to judge which kind of Bit will be moſt convenient for him, but however, you are to give him that at firſt which you ſhall think moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; If you have not many of a different kind by you, then you are rather to give him a gentle one than a Rude, and you are alſo to take care that it be right lodged in his Mouth, that is, that it be neither placed too high, which would make him Frum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up his Lips, nor too low, which would make it reſt upon his Tushes.</p>
                     <p>This done, cauſe one Mount him, and after he hath adjuſted the Bridle Reins in his hand, let him try to pull the horſe two or three ſteps back; you will know as he is going back, if his Head be firm, and if he performeth it franckly, or only obeyes with Reluctancy, that ſo you may give him another Bit, which may help to gain his conſent, without either troubling or hurting his Mouth.</p>
                     <p>If in going back he bring in his Head to a right poſture, that is, if having formerly thruſt out his Noſe, he now bring it in ſo as that it ſtands perpendicular to the ground, then it is certainly the fault of the Perſon that formerly Rode him, that he hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready placed his Head in that poſture, for his once doing it, is a ſign that he can, and therefore there is nothing but to let him acquire a Habit of it.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards cauſe him to go at a ſtep or walk, and let the Rider feel him on his Hand, that ſo he may oblige him to place his Head in the moſt beautiful poſture he is capable of with that Bit, and do you at the ſame time endeavour, to know if he have either too large or too ſmall a Bit in his Mouth; too large, in that it maketh
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:179659:157"/>him frumple his Lips, and that at the ſame time the hooks which faſten the Curb do alſo pinch him; and too little, in that he ſwallows his Bit-mouth as we Term it.</p>
                     <p>Conſider next the length of the Branches, which may with a little experience be eaſily underſtood; As whither too long or too ſhort, which a little reaſoning will diſcover to you, becauſe if the horſe be ſuch as you know there is a neceſſity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain much, then they are to be ſhortned, but if but gently and little, then they muſt be lengthed, and eſpecially if he either beat on the hand, or have a too ſlender Neck, for in thoſe caſes the Branches are to be made very long, becauſe their oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation coming ſlowly and at a diſtance, it will ſurpriſe the Horſes Beard, as well as his Shoulders and Legs, a great deal leſs, than if they were ſhorter, and that their Effects came from a ſhort diſtance, that is, which were nearer to the Hand of the Rider.</p>
                     <p>Again cauſe the horſe to go at a ſtep or Gallop, to Part and Stop ſuddenly, and by ſeeing him perform theſe Actions, you may judge whether he have a good or but an indifferent mouth; if you judge by his eaſie ſtopping, that he hath a very fine mouth, then give him only a Simple Canon-mouth, for when a Man can make good uſe of a horſe with a <hi>Canon-ſimple,</hi> he ſhould never ſeek after another.</p>
                     <p>After this open your Horſe's Mouth, ſuffering the Bit mouth to remain in its place, and by this you will know whether his tongue be ſo big, as that he will need either a Bit with a like Liberty, or one that is larger than that he hath already, and which you may alſo come to know more eaſily, if you obſerved him to have his <hi>Appuy</hi> or feeling of the Bit ſomewhat Dull. becauſe in this Caſe, there is a neceſſity to diſengage his tongue, and the like, if he Arm his Barrs with his Lips; but if he ſhould have a dull <hi>Appuy,</hi> becauſe of his Arming himſelf with his Lips againſt the preſſure of the Bit, and yet have high and ſharp ridged Barrs, then his Barrs are only to be diſcharged of his Lips, and that only by accident, as I have before told you.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe incline to carry low, you are not to give him a liberty for the tongue which will riſe too high, for that, by tickling his palate would bring his head down between his Legs.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall next feel his Barrs, to obſerve how they are ſhap't, for it is partly they, that make a mouth either good or bad; if they are ſharp ridged, then you are to give your Horſe a gentle Bit mouth, and you are not ſo much as to mention a <hi>Pigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle,</hi> which is only proper for round Barrs.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe have them very fleſhy and low, then you muſt have recourſe to ſuch mouths as will reach them, but if his Barrs be high and altogether inſenſible, which is what we call a <hi>Falſe mouth,</hi> then in that caſe, you may give him a mouth with the Liberty after Mr <hi>Pignatell's</hi> faſhion, or after the form of an Aſſes tread; becauſe for ſuch Bit mouths as are beneath the line of the Barrs, they produce in <hi>Falſe mouth'd</hi> Horſes but an ugly grimace, and a yet worſe effect.</p>
                     <p>Having obſerved all I have been telling you, you are yet to cauſe ride your Horſe, to cauſe him Part and Stop, go back, Part again, and then go at a Walk, that ſo you may judge if he have ſtrong Reins, ſound Legs: and good Feet, or if his hind quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be ſtronger than his fore.</p>
                     <p>For your Horſe may have contracted theſe imperfections, by reaſon of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming bad Stops through ignorance, a bad Habit, or by any impatient ardour occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd many times by his want of Reins, or for having painful and weak Hams; therefore it is not a rude bridle will rectifie ſuch imperfections, but good leſſons well practiſed, for a rude Bit will produce more diſorder and confuſion than good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and that becauſe the ground or lower parts of a Horſe's mouth are generally good, but rude Bits perfectly ſpoyl them.</p>
                     <p>It may happen that the horſe you intend to Bit, hath been diſorderly with the Bit he carries, becauſe it is too rude for him; it is in that caſe eaſie to give him one more Gentle.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe beat on the hand, you are to endeavour to diſcover the motive obliged him to it; the univerſal remedy for ſuch horſes is the <hi>Canon à Trompe,</hi> provided the fault proceed not from the Horſeman, who may have either too hard a hand, or otherwiſe cleave too much to the Bridle.</p>
                     <p>When you are about to Bit a Horſe you have only ſeen a little, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know ſo exactly all his imperfections, you are to inform your ſelf of them; to wit if he be heavy on the hand, or if he Heat in the mouth, if he retain his ſtrength, for if he be hot and Fiery, to the end you may take your meaſures accordingly.</p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:179659:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>If your Horſe have a weak Fore hand, you are to give him a Bridle which will ſubject him more than otherwayes you would; and if his Hind-hand be weak by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome infirmities, as <hi>Jardons, Spavins,</hi> &amp;c. Then you muſt give him a Bridle which reſtrains leſs, than one you would give him had he not theſe infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Now by all that hath been immediatly ſaid, and from the knowledge of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Bit mouths heretofore deſcribed, you may eaſily form your project for preſcribing a Bit-mouth for any Horſe whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Let us next proceed to the Branch; I ſuppoſe you have alſo a ſufficient knowledge of its different effects as I have explained them; becauſe according to them, you are to conſider after what manner a Horſe carrieth his head, that ſo you may fix upon the Branch you intend to give him.</p>
                     <p>You are to obſerve that the Bit-mouth, that is, that kind which you are to put in the Horſe's mouth, ſhould regulate you in ſome meaſure as to his mouth, becauſe a Bit-mouth may be ſtrengthned or weakned by the Branch; and therefore you are to conſider, whither you deſign to ſubject and reſtrain your Horſe, by means of the Bit-mouth, or Branch, becauſe a hardy Branch may be given upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe, to a Horſe who bringeth in his head aboundantly well, and ſo there may be alſo given a Branch which raiſeth, to a Horſe who hath no need of it, and that for either fortifying or weakning a Bit-mouth, according to your intention and deſign.</p>
                     <p>The modern way of Bitting horſes is very different from the ancient; For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, they only ſubjected their Horſes with rude Bit mouths, whereas at preſent People make only uſe of ſuch as are Gentle, but then to ſupply that, the Branches are now made more hardy, for heretofore they were almoſt all <hi>Flaques</hi> or Gentle, but at preſent there are ſcarce any of theſe to be ſeen, becauſe People have fortified them not only at the Sevill-hole, but alſo at the Eye and Ham; it is true the place where the Curb reſteth ſuffers a little by it, but that is more eaſily rectified, than any of the internal parts of the mouth, when they come to be hurt or ſpoilt.</p>
                     <p>If your horſe Carry well, a Branch <hi>à Gigotte</hi> or half after the French faſhion, with the Sevill-hole upon the line of the Banquet, will keep him in that poſture.</p>
                     <p>If he Carry low give him a branch <hi>à la Coneſtable,</hi> made very hardy at the Ham, and whoſe Sevill-hole remains about an inch upon the outſide of the line of the Banquet.</p>
                     <p>If he thruſt out his Noſe, give him only a Branch this is ſimply hardy.</p>
                     <p>If he Arm himſelf againſt his Counter, you muſt give him a Branch <hi>à Genouil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if he thruſt or carry his Neck ſtreight out, then give him a Branch <hi>à Gigotte,</hi> which Bringeth in much, and but Raiſes little.</p>
                     <p>I fine, I believe I have explained ſo clearly the effects of the Branches before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that ſhould I ſay any more of them, it would prove but an uſeleſs repetition.</p>
                     <p>You are to take particular care, that the Bit-mouth you order to make be not too large, for that gives Wings (as we ſay) to the Branches, or makes them ſtart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; as alſo that the Curb reſt in its proper place, for without this, the Bit mouth will not have that effect you might have expected from it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liberty</hi> for the Tongue, ſhould have only the length of an Inch between the two heels of the Bit mouth, I do not as before, underſtand here an inch conſiſting of twelve lines, but only an ordinary one containing about nine or ten.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> of the Branch ſhould be no higher above the Bit mouth, then three ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary finger breadths, or twenty two lines.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Banquet</hi> it ſelf ſhould ſtand plum or perpendicular; if it incline towards the Horſe's Neck, as it is the cuſtom of ignorant Bit-makers to cauſe it, then it will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the effect of the Branch, for if it ſhould but incline that way only one line, it would be a conſiderable diſtance when its line is prolonged the length of the Sevill-hole.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Shoulder</hi> ſhould take its riſe no higher, then from the middle of the Arch of the Banquet, neither ſhould it have any more for its greateſt tour or compaſs when it is moſt hardy, but only the height of the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Large <hi>Curbs,</hi> providing they be round, are alwayes the moſt Gentle; the moſt part of People who keep Horſes, Fancie there is no better way to fit a Horſe exactly with a Bit, then alwayes to change them untill they fall upon that they would have, this ſay they is the eaſieſt and moſt certain way of any.</p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:179659:158"/>
                     <p>My Opinion is, That it is very convenient, eſpecially for ſuch as have no great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Bitting Horſes, to have a good many Bits by them, that ſo they may make uſe of them as I am going to ſhow.</p>
                     <p>When they would then Bit a Horſe, let them put into his mouth, (having firſt obſerved what I have been immediatly directing) any Bit they ſhall judge moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him, and from it they may eaſily take certain meaſures, as to the Bit which will be moſt proper for him, for they will thereby know if there be either too much or too little in his Mouth, as alſo what is to be rectified in the Branch, whether it be too long or too ſhort, if its Eye, Shoulder, or Sevill-hole, have their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſo they may cauſe make a Bridle conform, and which they judge will be moſt proper and convenient.</p>
                     <p>But to go without any kind of knowledge from a Rude Bit to a Gentle, and from a Long Branch to a Short, and thus to skip from Bit-mouth to Bit-Mouth, and from Branch to Branch, without either deſign or skill, is but juſt as if a man ſhould attempt to look for any thing with his Eyes ſhut, and will ſerve only to falfifie a Horſe's Mouth, and if it be tender and delicate, to render it uncertain; So that People thereby, many times trouble and ſpoyla Horſe's mouth, inſtead of giving either eaſe to it, or make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it better.</p>
                     <p>It is not, but that this way of chuſing a Bit, may ſometimes ſucceed with ſuch Horſes as have excellent mouths, ſuch as thoſe which have a full <hi>Appuy</hi> or reſt upon the hand, and ſuch Perſons as can do no better, commit no great fault in making uſe of it, but I look upon it to be the method only of ſuch, as have not the leaſt Tincture of this Art, for which I aſſure you there is required a great Application, as well as a little practice; however ſay they the thing with a little ſtudy is not ſo very difficult, becauſe People find in <hi>Paris</hi> a great many who chuſe Bits wonderfully well, and yet know nothing belonging to Horſes, have no knowledge of their qualities, neither did they ever Ride any; If then thoſe Gentlemen have ſucceeded ſo well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever Mounting, or ſo much as knowing any thing belonging to a horſe, ſurely thoſe Cavalliers in whoſe behalf I write theſe Lines, may with far greater reaſon hope to ſucceed in it, ſeeing it would appear, that no man can with certainty direct a Bit for a horſe, according to the Rules of Art, if he do not firſt know his Legs, Feet, Reins, Vigour, and Lightneſs; this is indeed a knowledge which all good horſemen have, and which will therefore make them ſucceed ſooner in Bitting a Horſe, than theſe Gentlemen, who know nothing of a Horſe but his Jaws and Barrs, becauſe of their having immediatly felt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There is one Chapter more belonging to this part, wherein our Author gives ſome directions, for dyeting or preparing a Horſe for a Match or Courſe; I have removed it hence to the 35 Chap: of the following Supplement of Horſemanſhip, where you will find it inſert in the 84 Page under this Title,</q> 
                        <hi>A method to prepare Running Horſes, ſomewhat more ancient than the former, and ſet doun by</hi> Monſieur Solleyſel, <hi>at the cloſe of the ſecond part, of the French impreſſion of the Parfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <q>judging it a great deal more proper to ſet both Methods together, (ſeeing I was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his, to give in that Treatiſe particular directions concerning Running Horſes) than to have them placed at a diſtance from other ſo that they could not be ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily compared; This I thought fit to advertiſe the Reader of leſt he might Fancy I had either forgot it, or wilfully ſhuffled it out of this Book: But this will let him know that I have done neither,</q> but only Tranſpoſed it, as well for the advantage of the diſcourſe, as his particular Conveniency.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>OUR Famous Author, having in the two preceeding Diſcourſes which put a cloſe to the Firſt Part of his Book; Given moſt Exact and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Directions, for Breeding and Bitting all Kinds of Horſes, I judg'd it Proper, that I might Render that Firſt Part yet more Compleat, (there being little or nothing of the Art of Riding contained in it,) to Subjoyn to it this Exact Collection of Horſemanſhip: For of what uſe is a Good Breed of Horſes, or the Art to know, and make Choice of a Proper Bitt, if a Man know not how to Mount and Rid the One, and make Uſe of the Other?</p>
                  <p>It was therefore the Conſideration of this, which firſt moved me to make this Collection, which is taken from the very Beſt of Writers upon this Subject, ſuch as <hi>La' Brow, Pluvinel,</hi> and the Great Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> But chiefly out of this Laſt: All which I have taken pains to bring unto ſome kind of Order and Method, and with as few Repetitions as poſſible, ſeing I therein deſign all imaginable Brevity and Perſpicuity, both which I make no doubt, but after a ſerious Peruſal will be found obſerved to the full.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo to ſhow, that my Deſign in this Treatiſe is not to inſtruct <hi>Novices,</hi> or ſuch who have never had any Tincture in the Art of <hi>Horſemanſhip;</hi> For the one would be as Ridiculous as the other is Impoſſible, no Reading in the World being capable to make a Man Maſter of any Practical Art, without having had firſt ſome Experience in it: But as it is not intended for perſons altogether Ignorant of <hi>Riding;</hi> So I dare be bold to promiſe a great dale of Succeſs to ſuch, who (having but a good Seat upon Horſe-back, and Judgement enough to put in Execution what I direct,) ſhall ſeriouſly and with due Attention peruſe it, which I think is all can be really promiſed or juſtly Expected, from the beſt Book that ever will be Writ upon any Practical Subject whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Therefore not to detain the Reader with longer Prefacing, I only beg that he would with as great Diligence and Aſſiduity endeavour to practiſe my Directions, as I have with Exactneſs and Care Collected them, and then no doubt both our Expectations ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Excellencie of the Art, and of the moſt conſiderable Authors who have writ of it.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Art of Riding is ſo Noble and Gentile an Exerciſe,<note place="margin">CHAP: I.</note> that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a whole Book meerly to deduce and expreſs its Excellency; For as to Pleaſure and State, what Prince or Monarch looks more great or more Enthron'd, then upon a beautifull Horſe, with rich Furniture, and waving Plums, making his Entry through great Cities, to amaze the People with pleaſure and Delight.</p>
                     <p>Or what more Glorious and Manly, than at great Marriages of Princes, to run at the Ring, Tilt, or Courſe in the Field? What can be more Comely and Pleaſing, then to ſee Horſes go all their ſeveral Ayres: And to ſee ſo Excellent a Creature, with ſo much Spirit and Strength, to be ſo Obedient to his Rider, as if having no will but his, they had but one Body, and one Mind, like to a <hi>Centour?</hi> But above all, what ſetts off a King more, then to be upon a Beautifull and Readie Horſe, at the head of his Army.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt longer upon this, Let us ingenouſly acknowledge, that this Noble Art was firſt begun and invented in <hi>Italie;</hi> So that it is the <hi>Italians</hi> who have given the firſt Directions for putting in practice thoſe Rules, which they invented for dreſſing of Horſes, and making them capable to ſerve advantagiouſly in War; And alſo, to give all the Satisfaction and Pleaſure imaginable in the Carrier or Mannage.</p>
                     <p>And as they themſelves did much practiſe this Noble Art, ſo was it alſo upon that account that all the <hi>French</hi> and other Nations went thither to be taught, the Seat of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip being firſt at <hi>Naples,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither a great number of all Nations repaired, to make themſelves Horſemen: But thoſe who deſigned to come to a greater perfection in this Art, went to <hi>Naples,</hi> where they were kept two or three years; before the Maſters ſo much as told them if they were capable either to learn, or become Teachers of it, ſo well did thoſe Gentlemen, the Eſquiers, know to eſteem their Talent, of which they were more frugal I aſſure you, then People now a dayes are.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:179659:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>The firſt who ever writ of it was one <hi>Frederick Griſon</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> And truly he writ like a Horſeman, and a great Maſter in the Art for theſe times, it being then but in its Infancie; for we may ſee to what perfection it is brought ſince that time, and ſeeing it is an eaſie matter to follow a beaten path; It is therefore no great wonder if the <hi>French</hi> have ſince that time brought this Art to ſome kind of perfection, ſeeing other perſons gave them matter whereupon to work: However it was nobly done in <hi>Griſon</hi> to have been the firſt whoever writ of this Subject; and for which he is much to be commended, ſeeing (conſidering the time his Book was publiſhed) What he writ was ſo good; <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight ſent for two <hi>Italians</hi> that were his Schollars, to come to him into <hi>England;</hi> And if one of them came all our <hi>Alexanders,</hi> for their Schollars ſtocked the whole Kingdom with Horſemen.</p>
                     <p>The old Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> ſent for an Excellent Rider out of <hi>Italy,</hi> called <hi>Signior Claudio Curtio,</hi> who writ a Book of Horſemanſhip, which is quoted by ſeveral <hi>Italian</hi> Writers, but <hi>I</hi> think that very much of his Book is ſtollen out of <hi>Griſon: Laurentius Cuſſius</hi> is another Author, but none of the beſt, and with horrible Bitts, which <hi>I</hi> believe were never made uſe of by any, but it ſeemeth his deſign of writing of Bitts, was more out of vanity to ſhow his pretended skill and fancy, then any deſire he had to gratifie the Publict. Then there is <hi>Caeſar Fieske</hi> who writ a Book much out of <hi>Griſon</hi> too, where he meddles with Muſick, that ſo a man may regulate the Sound of his voice when he intendeth to help a Horſe, according to the different Ayres which he intendeth to make him go, &amp; he buildeth much upon his knowledge of knowing how to help well with the voice. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book of Horſemanſhip called <hi>Gloria del Cavallo,</hi> with long diſcourſes and much out of <hi>Griſon,</hi> eſpecially as to what concerns the dreſſing of Horſes. There is alſo another <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> Book of Horſemanſhip, called <hi>Cavallo Fraenato de Pietro Antonio</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> much ſtollen out of <hi>Griſon:</hi> But his Book conſiſts moſt of Bitts to little purpoſe, though they ſeem to be great Curioſities: But the moſt famous Horſeman that ever was in <hi>Italy</hi> was a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> who lived at <hi>Naples,</hi> called <hi>Signior Pignatel,</hi> but he never writ, although he could certainly have done it very well, being one of the ableſt Maſters ever was in <hi>Italy. Monſieur La Broue</hi> rid under him five years, <hi>Monſieur de Pluvinel</hi> nine years, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> St. <hi>Anthione</hi> many years, The Liberty which we account the beſt for Bitts at this day, is called a <hi>La pignatel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe three laſt mentioned <hi>French men,</hi> who rid under <hi>Signior Pignatel</hi> filled <hi>France</hi> with <hi>French</hi> Horſemen, which before was filled with <hi>Italians; Monſieur la Broue</hi> was I believe the firſt that ever writ of Horſemanſhip in the <hi>French</hi> Language, and the firſt <hi>Frenchman</hi> who writ well of that Art, although he be a little too tedious, and hath many words for little matter: As for <hi>Pluvinel</hi> no doubt but he was a good Horſeman, but his invention of the three pillars, which his Book pretends to be an infallible method, is no more then an abſolute <hi>Routine,</hi> and hath ſpoiled more horſes then ever any thing elſe did, for Horſes are not made at all to the hand and heel by them, neither will they go except in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual place where they are ridden, and not well there neither.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Pluvinel</hi> came our excellent Author <hi>Monſieur Solizel,</hi> The firſt part of whoſe Book of <hi>Marſchalrv</hi> you have had here immediatly proceeding, ſo that the peruſing of it will ſpeak more his Commendation, then any thing I can poſſibly ſay; And therefore I refer you to it, he never writ any thing of Riding (although he could certainly have done it very well, being a moſt knowing and underſtanding Horſeman) Save ſome Obſervations u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> ſecond Book of Horſemanſhip, which are indeed moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and ſufficiently diſcover the great Talent and Genious he had for underſtanding every thing relating to Horſes: The <hi>Italian</hi> Writers are commonly tedious, and writ more of Marks, Collours, Temperatures, Elements, Moon, Stars, Winds and Bleedings, then of the Art of Riding, and that only to make up a Book when they have not enough of True Art to fill it up another way, and this much of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Writers.</p>
                     <p>As for our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Mr <hi>Blundevil</hi> is one of the firſt, who was indeed a fine Gentleman, and good Tranſlator, but a better Schollar then Horſe-man, for he tyed himſelf too much to Old Authors, who knew as little as he in Horſemanſhip, and ſo Authority abuſed him, having no knowledge himſelf in the Art, and Totally wanting Experience in it: But for his Treaty of dyeting Horſes, It is truely as Learned as any Phyſician can write, but yet is nothing as it ought to be, becauſe of his want of Practice; his Cures of Diſeaſes are likewayes moſt admirable, and he is indeed the Father of all that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the beſt who hath Writ in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language upon that ſubjct: <hi>Markhom</hi> is but <hi>Blundevil</hi> in another Dreſs, yet will not acknowledge it; He hath many new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicins, but not much worth, ſuch as his Oyl of Oats, nor was he any thing of a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but only took notes of Medicins and ſet them down Methodically.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:179659:162"/>
                     <p>After him came <hi>De la Grev,</hi> which is alſo but <hi>Blundevil,</hi> with ſome new Medicins that are but indifferent: And as for his Method of raiſing a Breed, it is moſt rediculous, being altogether contrary to the common courſe of Nature, and that which I believe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any made tryal of but himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But after all theſe came the Prince of Horſemen, the Great Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who may be juſtly ſaid to have given the very laſt and Maſter Stroaks for the perfecting of this Subject, for it was he who firſt deſcrived the Natural, and Artificial motions which ſhould be made by the Leggs of all Horſes, when they are performing ſuch and ſuch an Ayr, which is the Foundation and very Ground work of Horſemanſhip, for without that knowledge a Man but Groaps in the Dark, And if he ſucceed in any thing, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding more to a luckie chance than ſolid Judgement; and if any before him did ever touch upon this matter, it was but very ſuperficially, whereas he goeth to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and Foundation, and thereby ſo firmly ſupports his new and extraordinary Method for dreſſing of Horſes, that a Man muſt needs either own and acknowledge it, to be by far the beſt that ever yet was publiſhed, or otherwayes deny and Renounce the ſolid Arguments of Reaſon, and Experience: But that which renders his Writings yet the more wonderful, is that they ſhould be compiled by a perſon of ſo great a Quality and plentiful Fortune; Such perſons having commonly either no great inclination, ſo much to ſtreach their invention, as to be the firſt propogators of any thing which is New, or otherwayes the great Hurrie they are in about buſineſs, not allowing them ſo much ſpare time as to reflect upon them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore our <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> is ſo much the more beholden to this Noble Author, who not only was at the trouble to convaſs the Ancient Writers, and diſcover their errors, but alſo to make a New diſcovery of his own, and leave it to them as a Monument, by which the Nation which was formerly beholding to forreign Horſemen, is at preſent made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, if the neglect be not their own, not only of becoming Skilful Horſemen at home, and conſequently to ſtand no more in need of Strangers to inſtruct them, but alſo of contributing to the improvement of their Neighbouring Nations, who do all with one accord juſtly acknowledge him to have been not only the greateſt, but the moſt exact and Skilful Horſeman who ever Writ. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors who have Writ ſince, being for the moſt part rather Collectors and Copiers, then Original Authors, I ſhal not Name them; And thus much of the Authors, whither <hi>Italian, French,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who firſt put Pen to Paper upon this ſo Noble, Heroick, and Gentlemany a Subject.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179659:163"/>
                     <p>But what makes theſe men ſpeak againſt it? The firſt reaſon is, becauſe they are <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> and ſo ſpeak as the Wiſeſt men in the World muſt do, when they diſcourſe of any thing they underſtand not, and think that talk will carry it, but the main reaſon is this, they find they cannot Ride well, nay indeed not at all a mannaged Horſe, and yet they would be eſteemed the fineſt Men in the World for all things, though they will take pains for nothing and becauſe forſooth they cannot Ride by inſpiration, and without taking the leaſt pains to acquire it, therefore it is worth nothing, and of no uſe: But if every thing elſe were naught that they cannot do, there would be very few good things in the World.</p>
                     <p>The nixt thing is, that they think it a diſgrace for a Gentleman to do any thing well, what, be a Rider, why not? Many Kings and Princes have thought themſelves Graced by being good Horſemen: Yea our preſent and moſt Gracious King is not only a very Graceful Horſeman, but alſo taketh great delight in Riding, And I dar ſay thinketh it no diſgrace that he is reputed a good Horſeman; I would therefore deſire ſuch People to be more Merciful, and to think it no diſgrace for them to be Horſemen: But ſtill the Old buſineſs doth ſtick with them, which is, they cannot do it, and therefore it is nought, A very good and Gentlemany reaſon indeed! But I muſt tell them that he who will take pains for nothing, ſhall never do any thing well; For Arts, Sciences, and good Qualities, come not by inſtinct, but are got by great Labour, Study, and Practice, but it ſeems ſuch Gentlemen reſolve to underſtand none of them, until they be as eaſily learned, as Wenching and Drinking, Railing, and wearing Fine Cloaths and Feathers.</p>
                     <p>But let us now ſee how theſe Sparks are on Horſeback, and what their Horſes do under them; firſt theſe Cavaliers ſit as far back in the Sadle as they can, their Leggs ſtreatched forewards before the Shoulders of the Horſe, and their Toes a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turned out, than if they were walking a foot, that ſo they may with the more eaſe Spurr their Horſes in the Shoulders; they ſtoop in the back, and lean very much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which they call a comely Seat, neither know they how to hold the Bridle, or gueſs at any helps at all, but appear on Horſeback as if they were three quarters foxt, ſo rediculous is that ſeat: And having ſent to a Sadler or Bit-maker to Bitt their Horſes, all is well.</p>
                     <p>Being mounted thus as I tell you, let us now ſee the readineſs of their Horſes, and their own Horſemanſhip and Addreſs, when they would turn to the Right hand, their Horſes turn to the left, and when they would turn to the left, their Horſes turn to the Right, when they would ſtop, their Horſes run away, when they would go fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, their Horſes reſt and run back, when they would put them back, their Horſes riſe and come over upon them, and there my good Horſemen ly until a Surgion or Boneſetter be ſent for, and it is good if they are not killed: Nay, their Horſes will come near neither Drum, Trumpet, or Collours, piſtle, or Sword: But they fetch forty fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies to indanger their Rider. Now theſe are the excellent Horſemen, and the ready Horſes for ſervice, And how is it poſſible to be otherwayes, when the Horſes know not how to anſwer either Heels or Hand, and their Riders are as ignorant, if not more then they, whence it followeth, that there is nothing ſo fit to make a ſure and ready Horſe as the Mannage.</p>
                     <p>Therefore every Horſe that wears a Bitt, Gelding, or Nage, will be certainly the better to be wrought in the Mannage, both for readyneſs and ſafity: for without ſettling upon the hand they are both very uneaſy and dangerous. <hi>I</hi> muſt likewayes tell you, that Corvets and other Ayres, ſettle a Horſe mightily upon the hand, make him light before, and put him upon his Haunches, which are all uſefull for a Souldiets horſe, and make him ſtop upon his Haunches, which is very uſeful, eſpecially for a man in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for did his Horſe ſtop upon the Shoulders, he would give his Rider (being Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſuch a Shock, as would make his Bones ake were he never ſo ſound; Nay, to make a Horſe goe in Leaps or Capriols, firms him alſo upon the Hand, which is good for a Souldiers Horſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſayes a Galant, when I ſhould have uſe for him in the Field, than he would be playing tricks: But this is a great miſtake, for the helps to make Horſes go in Ayres, and to make them go upon the ground are vaſtly different, and good Horſemen have much a do to make them go in Ayres with their beſt helps: So that if you let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they will not trouble you, beſides, two or three dayes March will make them that they will not go in Ayres if you would have them, and yet they are much the readier to go on the ground; whereby you ſee that there is no Horſe whatſoever can be a good and uſeful horſe in any kind with a Bitt, but what is wrought in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>That people are mightily diſceived, who by meer Speculation without practice, think to become good and Skilful Horsemen.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Have known ſome People ask,<note place="margin">CHAP: IV.</note> If the Reading a Book of Horſemanſhip would make them good Horſemen? To thoſe I anſwer, That good Books upon any practical Art which are plainly Writ, are certainly very uſeful, but then you muſt have all in your memorie, and perhaps even then you do not underſtand them, but put the caſe you do: Yet wanting practice it is impoſible you can Ride well, and yet no fault at all in the Books, but in you.</p>
                     <p>It is true, there are ſome people who think they can ſee nothing but what they can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly do, which muſt be certainly by inſpiration, by which I never knew any to Ride, though many pretend to Preach by it. Do you think that an ignorant School-boy can be as Learned as a Doctor; Or let a skilful Muſician Write the Rareſt Book in the World for Compoſing and Singing, can you imagine that as ſoon as you have read his Book you can do what he teacheth; No truely, and yet not the Books fault, but yours, in being ſo partial to your ſelf, as to think you can do any thing at firſt ſight without Practice or Study, which would be a Miracle I never ſaw, nor I believe any body elſe ever ſhall.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame manner if a Luteneſt ſhould Write a Rate Book, can you expect that as ſoon as you have read it, you can play upon the Lute, becauſe it may be you can jangle the ſtrings: but you ſay you can Ride; truely juſt as you jangle the Lute Strings, and no other wayes; You have perhaps been taught a little in ſome of the Accademies in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> that is ſomething indeed: So many Crowns a Month, and the Horſe did not throw you, and that is all. Now GOD knows how many Young Gentlemen are in this Condition when they come newly out of the Accademies, who are famed for good Horſemen, and yet truely no peice of a Horſeman: For the moſt part of what they know, is only a Graceful ſeat, the reſt being only a meer Rott, beat unto them by the ſet form of Bauling, which Maſters commonly make uſe of ſo ſoon as ever their Horſes begin a Repriſe, of the truth of which many young people when they come to a little more knowledge, are by their woful experience moſt ſenſible, eſpecially when they come to break and work any young, Rude, or Unmannaged Horſe, which is not already made to their hand; for than they find that it is not the routine of a few ſniffling Aids which they have got in an Accademy, and which they know not ſeaſonably to make uſe of, but a true knowledge of the Principles of the Art, and a ſolid Judgement how to apply them, that muſt do the Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But ſayes one, I can Ride a ready Horſe, wherein he is deceived, for a ready Horſe is the hardeſt of all to Ride, becauſe the leaſt motion is an abſolute command to him, and an ignorant gives him ſuch countertimes as puts him quite out, another becauſe he hath Rid a Hundred Miles in a day, (which a Poſt Boy can do) or becauſe he can run a match with his Groom, Spring a Hedg, or leap a Ditch at Hunting, and hold by the Main, thinks himſelf a Horſeman, but his Hunts-boy doth as much; And my Lord Mayor when he goeth to weigh Butter, ſits a Legg of either ſide the Horſe very gravely, aknowing and excellent Horſeman indeed! and many Wenches have been known to Ride a Stride, Gallop, and run their Horſes, that could I think hardly Ride a Horſe well in the Mannage.</p>
                     <p>Are there not in all Trades bound Apprentices, ſeven ot nine Years, and many bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of them too, and in higher profeſſions, Twenty and Thirty years is not too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are great Maſters in any of them, and though Horſemanſhip be almoſt as difficult as any, yet many a Gentleman would ride the firſt day as well as the greateſt Maſter, but he is deceived as well as thoſe who think to Buy with their Money any good quality: Therefore although it cannot be denyed but a man may reap a great deal of benefite by Reading a good Book upon any practical ſubject, eſpecially if he have had at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a little practice and inſtruction from a Maſter: yet it is not a Book alone, but long Study, and diligent practice, a long habit and Cuſtome, that muſt make any man knowing in Horſemanſhip, and conſequently a compleat and skilful Horſeman.</p>

                     <p>Some ſay again that they will Ride no Horſes twice a day, but ſuch as are vitious and of great ſtrength: Many Horſes its true are vitious, but it is as true there are none of ſuch ſtrength as they talk of, for if a Horſe be very vitious, you muſt correct him ſmartly, &amp; ride him ſo long until be obey you in ſome ſmall meaſure, and then I am ſure you will have Rid him ſo violently, &amp; ſo long, that he will hardly be for Riding nixt Morning, far leſs to be Rid any more that day; And if the Horſe be ſo docil as to obey you in every thing, then certainly the beſt way is to take but a little of him that Morning to encourage him to do ſo again. So far ſhould you be from thinking of Riding him again that ſame very day, and thus he will be pleaſent, lively, and vigorous, take pleaſure in you and the Mannage, and after this manner learn more in a Month, Riding him but once a day, then he ſhall do in three Riding him twice.</p>
                     <p>Have not all Schollars alſo Play dayes, and certain hours of reſt in their dayes of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? all Tradſemen Holy dayes to rejoice in, States men Divertiſement from Buſineſs, and Good Preachers preach not every.

                     <p>Such perſons I think may be very juſtly compared to the <hi>Polander,</hi> who being ſick, and his Phyſician giving him nine pils to be taken, three every night, for three nights together, very wiſely conſidered, that if three pills every Night for three Nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would recover him, then taking all the nine in one Night would make him well preſently, which accordingly he did, and had almoſt purged himſelf out of this World, So any Horſeman who will undertake to make a Horſe as well in three Moneths, with two leſſons a day, as another will in ſix Moneths; with once a day, may be aſſured he will ſooner kill his Horſe than teach him; and thereby ſhew himſelf rediculous in his Undertaking.</p>

                        <p>Therefore no Horſe ſo fit to breed on as a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, either for the Mannage, Warrs, Journey, Hunting, or Running; I ſay he is abſolutely the beſt Stallion in the World for all theſe uſes I have named, if you do wiſely appropriate ſuch Mares to him, as ſhall be fit for ſuch uſes as you would have your Breed, and ſo he is fit for all Breeds, but to breed Cart Horſes; The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath many Races, but his beſt a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe was at <hi>Cardona</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and beſides theſe of his Majeſtie, there are other moſt excellent Races, belonging not only to Noblemen, but alſo private Gentlemen; As for their prices it hath been affirmed by very Credable Perſons, that three or four hundred Piſtols for a Horſe, is no extraordinary Rate at <hi>Madrid.</hi>

                        <p>THE Barb is next to the Spaniſh Horſe for Wiſdom, but not near ſo wiſe, and that maketh him the much eaſier to be dreſt, beſides he is of a Gentle nature; docile, nervous, and light, he is as fine a Horſe as can be, but ſome what ſlender, and a little Lady like, and alſo ſo lazy and negligent in his walk, that he will ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Bowling green; he Trots like a Cow, Gallops low, and hath no great movement in any of theſe actions, but commonly he is <hi>Sineuy</hi> and <hi>Nervous,</hi> hath a clean ſtrength, is excellently winded, and conſequently good for running and to endure great Travel; he is alſo very apt to learn, and eaſie to be dreſt, being for the moſt part of a good diſpoſition, excellent apprehenſion, judgement and memory, and when ſearcht and wakened, no Horſe in the World goes all kind of Ayres better in the Mannage.</p>
                        <p>The Mountain <hi>Barbs</hi> they ſay are the beſt, I believe they are the Largeſt, but the midling or leſs ſize, which as is reported are to be had at an eaſie enough rate in <hi>Barbary</hi>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:179659:165"/>are rather to be eſteemed, for it is ſaid, that there you may buy a very fine <hi>Barb</hi> for twenty, twenty five, or Thirty Pounds at moſt; But then their journey is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what great, not by Sea, for from <hi>Tunis</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is no great Voyage, but from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to <hi>Calais</hi> by Land, you go all the length of <hi>France,</hi> and then at <hi>Calais</hi> they are Shipt for <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Barb</hi> is not ſo fit a Stallion for the Mannage, as for running Horſes, for he gets long and looſe Horſes, therefore I would not adviſe you to Breed of him for the Mannage, except he be a ſhort Horſe from Head to croup, ſtrong, well coupled, and of a ſuperfluity of Spirit which few <hi>Barbs</hi> have, therefore Breed rather of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, with choice <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mares, and if you have a delicate well choſen <hi>Dutch</hi> Mare or two, that will make an excellent compoſition for the Mannage, to conclude then what I have to ſay of the <hi>Barb,</hi> I ſay that as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe is called the Prince, ſo the <hi>Barb</hi> may be called the Gentleman amongſt Horſe kind.</p>

                        <p>As for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mares there are none like them in the World to Breed on, but then you muſt chooſe them fit for ſuch Horſes as you would Breed; As for example, if you would breed for the Mannage; The Mares muſt have fine fore hands, but not too long Necks, fine Heads, and well ſet on, there Necks rightly turned, with broad breaſts, good Eyes, and great bodies, that their Foles may have the more room to ly in them, they muſt have good Leggs and Hoofs; ſhort and bending Paſtorns, and are to be ſhort from Head to Foot, this is the ſhape of Mares which beſt fits the Mannage, and if your Mares be thus choſen it is no great matter what Colour they are of, or what marks they have, ſo they be full of ſtrength, have a ſuperfluity of Spirit, and not above ſix or ſeven years old, But I muſt tell you that if you have two or three fine <hi>Dutch</hi> Mares Shaped as I have told you; It will make a fine Compoſition with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe for the Mannage, and alſo a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe with ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mares as I have deſcrived to you, will make a breed not only fit for the Mannage, but for all manner of uſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, except the Plough and Cart.</p>

                        <p>But if you would have <hi>Mares</hi> to breed running Horſes upon, then they muſt be Shaped thus, as light as poſſible, large and long, but well ſhaped, a ſhort back, but long ſides, and a little long Legged, their breaſt as narrow as may be, for ſo they will Gallop lighter and Nimbler, and run the faſter, for the lighter and thinner you breed for Galloping ſo much the better; your Stallion by any means ſhould be a <hi>Barb,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Shape I have diſcrived the Mares to be of: For as I was Credibly informed by one of the greateſt Horſematchers that ever <hi>England</hi> bred, a <hi>Barb</hi> that is a Jade, will get a better running Horſe than the beſt running Horſe in <hi>England,</hi> ſome commend ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much the <hi>Turk</hi> for a Stallion to breed running Horſes by, but they are ſo ſcarſe and rate, that I can give no Judgement of them, and therefore I adviſe you to the <hi>Barb,</hi> which I believe is much the better Horſe to breed running Horſes by</p>

                        <p>I have ſpoke with ſeverall Gentlemen who have been at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as likewayes with diverſe Merchants who have come from thence, who all agree, that there are there the moſt beautifull Horſes in the World; Saying that in Soyl or Grazing time, there are many hundreds teddered, who when they have eaten one place bare, are ſhifted to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every Horſe having a man to look to him, and every man a little Tent to lye in; And they alſo ſaid, that it was one of the moſt glorious ſights that could be, to ſee thoſe Horſes thus teddered, which were the moſt beautifull Horſes could be, and certainly they are brave Horſes, for the price of one of them, will be about a hundred or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie Pounds, and then there is great difficulty to get a paſs, for the <hi>Grandſignor</hi> is very ſtrict, in not ſuffering any of his Horſes to go out of his Territories, And when that difficulty is over, you have alſo another, which is, if you have not a <hi>Turk</hi> or two for your convoy, they will be taken from you by the way: There is alſo the difficulty of a long Journey, and the danger of ſickneſs or Lameing, for you muſt come through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which is a long way; and you muſt have very carefull men to conduct them: A good Groom, and expert Farrier, and by no means to ſuffer any to ſhoe them but him, for when they perceive a fine Horſe among them, they will hire a Farrier to prick or ſpoile him in the ſhoeing, that they may have him, which is a thing but too frequently practiſed in theſe Countreys.</p>

It hath been an old ſaying, that the <hi>Poland</hi> Horſe are the beſt in the World, but it is to be underſtood of the <hi>Polanders</hi> themſelves when they fight upon Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and not of their horſes.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſes, they are not worth ſpeaking of, but if you will believe the People of theſe Nations, they will magnifie them extreamly, and ſo do all Nations whatſoever mightily commend their own Horſes, in Imitation of the <hi>Grow, who thinketh ſtill her own Bird the Faireſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now having given you a ſhort account of the different kinds of Horſes, I muſt tell you that there are good and bad of all Countrys in the World, but a great many more bad then good, as there are of Men; For though there be millions of Painters, yet there was but one <hi>Vandike</hi> in many Ages, the like in Muſick, Hoſemanſhip, Weapons, and Horſes, for a rare Horſe in any kind is a difficult thing to find I aſſure you; It is a hard thing alſo to find fit Horſes for the Mannage, either on the Ground, or in Ayres; 'Tis true Art doth much, but Nature is the Ground for Art to Work on, for without it Art can do but little.</p>
                        <p>I muſt alſo tell you, that running Horſes are the moſt eaſily found, and of none of the greateſt Uſe neither when you have them; They run commonly upon Heaths, which reſemble a green Carpet for ſoftneſs, and muſt there run all upon the Shoulders, which in troubleſome Grounds is ready to break ones Neck, and but of little uſe, although it be a Divertiſement, at preſent much in requeſt in theſe Iſlands: For my own part I would rather dreſs a Horſe for the Warr or Mannage, than prepare him for ſuch Courſes, where the pains and trouble do very often far exceed the Profit.</p>
                        <p>You now ſee how difficult a thing it is, to have a good Horſe in any kind, for any thing; Therefore I conclude, that a knowing Horſeman is not ſo happy for Horles as a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who knows nothing more, then to buy a Horſe in <hi>Smithfield</hi> for eight Pound ten Shillings or thereabouts, to carry him to the Country, and let him have never ſo many faults his ignorance finds none, wherein he is very happy; And this much of Outlandiſh Horſes.</p>

                        <note place="margin">CHAP: VII.</note> there are ſome of them very finely ſhap'd, having the ſmalleſt Heads and beſt ſet on, the fineſt turned Necks, thinneſt and well riſen, excellent Backs, good Bodys, their Leggs clean and ſinewey, admirable Hoofs,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179659:167"/>their Croups a little ſlender; And in a word, no horſe in the World better ſhap'd, but only their Ears are a little long, which me thinks is a Grace to them, they are of all Collours, as Bayes, Dapple Grayes, and ſo forth, extreamly ſtrong, and very large as any Horſes whatſoever, and alſo of great prices, as three or four hundred Piſtoles a Mule; The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath ſometimes very beautiful ones for his Coatch, they uſe them alſo very much for the Sadle, for they amble moſt curiouſly, and eaſily, ſeldom ſtumble, and when they do, they never fall further then their Knees, ſo that they are very ſafe and ſure to ride upon.</p>
                     <p>There be ſome very little and fine ones, like <hi>Scots Gallowayes,</hi> and upon thoſe it is that Generalls and great Commanders do commonly ride, when they go to view the Trenches, or other fortified Places, and the larger ſort they uſe for <hi>Sumpters, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> and many other Uſes; They alſo ride Poſt upon them: And it is reported that they will amble as faſt as any ordinary Horſe will go at a hand Gallop, they live long and ſound, thirty years at leaſt; And there are Males and Females of them, both very hot in the act of Generation, but neither the Males nor Females, get or bring forth any thing, either when they copulate together, or with any other Creature.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo ſaid, that a man is never aſſured of them from bitting or ſtriking, although he hath been their conſtant Keeper for twenty years, but I do not believe it; They are reputed alſo to have bad mouths, but that is becauſe they are ſpoilt with horrible Bitts, for people uſe both other Bitts and other Sadles and Furniture to them, then to Horſes, wherein they are very much miſtaken, becauſe to thoſe that are for the Sadle, I would uſe the very ſame Bitts and Sadles as for Horſes and none other: 'Tis true that for <hi>Sumpters,</hi> there be ſome peculiar things which they uſe for them only, and not for Horſes, which I confeſs are very comely: In <hi>Spain</hi> they uſed a while ago Ropes, both for the Mules and Horſes to draw the Coatches by; In ſtony wayes there is no Horſe like them, they are ſo ſure footed.</p>
                     <p>Now the Stallions which get theſe Mules, are large Aſſes, upon very fine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mares, and it is reported by very credible Authors, that a good <hi>Stallion</hi> Aſs will coaſt, at leaſt two hundred and fifty Piſtols, and ſometimes more, for which there is a very good Reaſon, ſeeing Mules are of ſo great uſe to them in <hi>Spain;</hi> And theſe <hi>Stallion-Aſſes,</hi> are alſo greater and larger then moſt kind of Horſes, and are ſo furious and full of ſpirit, that there are men who live only by the ordering of them, and no other People can do it, but theſe perſons who make a Trade of it; For others would be killed by them, theſe Keepers alſo hood the Aſſes when they cover any Mares, that they may not ſee them, for otherwayes they would pull the Mares in peeces and kill them, when they are in the rage of Luſt, and to hear them bray is a moſt loud and horrid noiſe, beyond the roaring of any Lion in the World.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee there is good Reaſon why they ſhould be of ſo great Prices, but one who thinks they are juſt ſuch little dull Aſſes as are in <hi>England,</hi> of twenty or thirty Shillings a peece, will certainly laugh to hear what I have been ſaying, becauſe they think there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in the World then what they have ſeen; As in ſuch a Caſe Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſaid well, that there were ſtranger things in the World, then between <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> the Aſſes in <hi>France</hi> are juſt like thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> little, lazie, dull, and woful things, and of as ſmall a price, only in thoſe parts of <hi>France</hi> which border with <hi>Spain,</hi> the Aſſes are ſomewhat larger, but nothing in compariſon of thoſe in <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>ſhe Aſſes</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> are alſo very fair and large, for otherwayes how could ſuch huge and bigg Creatures be produced.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Spainards</hi> are alſo very curious in all things about their Horſes, and their Grooms are ſo diligent that they never ſtay long out of the ſtable, but are alwayes doing of ſomething about them, eſpecially making clean their Mains, Toppeings, and Tails, alſo waſhing and pleating them; They eſteem highly their Horſes, and no Nation loves them better; The Maſter is frequently in the Stable to ſee the Grooms do their duty, but for all that the <hi>Spainards</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> are none of the beſt Horſemen, for they Ride ſhort, have ſtrange Spurrs and Sadles, but eſpecially Bitts which are moſt abominable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> are very careful &amp; neat about their Horſes, but they have loſt that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they formerly had of being good Horſemen: And to tell the truth they never juſtly deſerved it, but our Ignorance made us think that they did rarely, the contrary of which is now in this laſt age ſufficiently diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Moſt part of the <hi>French</hi> are curious in keeping and dreſſing their Horſes, and alſo highly Eſteemed them, giving great rates ſometimes for Horſes which they fancy, but <hi>French</hi> Grooms never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Almains</hi> or high <hi>Germans</hi> love Horſes well, ſome ſay they are very curious, and have good Grooms, but certainly there are no better Grooms in the World then our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grooms: Yet no Grooms are good except the Maſter look Strictly after them, for the Maſters eye makes the Horſe well dreſt, according to the Proverb, <hi>the Maſters Eye makes the horſe fat.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Denmark, Swede, Poland, Tranſilvania, Hungary,</hi> and all thoſe Countries thereabouts are much like the <hi>Almains,</hi> for little curioſity in keeping and dreſſing their Horſes, their Riding alſo is for the moſt part alike, and no Man in <hi>Germany</hi> will Ride without a a <hi>Cavezone,</hi> though he knoweth not at all the uſe of it; In <hi>Flanders, Brabant,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Holand,</hi> and the Countries adjacent to it, they are much like the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> I have heard hath a Stable of Horſes, and commonly a <hi>French</hi> Groom to wait upon them, he getteth his Horſes for the moſt part out of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> for he hath none good in his own Country; A Rider is alſo of no great uſe there unleſs he could dreſs and make a <hi>ready Bear,</hi> of which there is plenty in theſe parts.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Moguls</hi> Country there is nothing to dreſs except you would dreſs <hi>Elephants,</hi> and the beſt horſes they have come from <hi>Perſia,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawly</hi> reports, that in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> there are the beſt ſhaped Horſes, and the fineſt Collours in the World, beyond all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes and <hi>Barbs</hi> that ever he ſaw, and that they know there ſo little the uſe of horſes, that they kill them for their skins.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Denmark</hi> there are excellent good horſes, and in <hi>Norway</hi> little ſtrong horſes, but not very well ſhap'd having their heads commonly a little too bigg: And as for <hi>Iſland</hi> Horſes, they are all courled like Watter Dogs, and are ſo Frizled that no curry Comb nor any thing elſe can dreſs them, they are alſo but very dull Jades, and not worth the inquiring after.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THERE are great Diſputes amongſt Cavaleers about this buſineſs,<note place="margin">CHAP: IX.</note> I ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trouble you with the arguments, they uſe <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> upon this head, but only deliver to you my opinion anent it; Now thoſe who are for High and Large
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179659:168"/>Horſes, ſay they are ſtrong for a Shock, but they muſt know that all large Horſes are not ſtrong; Nay, for the moſt part they are not only the weakeſt Horſes, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Spirit and vigor: But put the caſe a great and large Horſe were ſtrong, yet being ſo tale and big, his ſtrength is diffuſed, and indeed ſo out of his ſtrength; that a middling horſe (<hi>Entre deux Selles</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ſay,) or a leſs fiſed horſe having his ſtrength united, and being a little lower, or as it were beneath him, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrow him, ſo that a middlng or leſs ſiſed horſe, is certainly and without doubt the beſt for the Warr, or a ſingle Combate.</p>
                     <p>Middling and leſs ſized Horſes have alſo for the moſt part, both ſtrength, Spirit, and Agility, and not one in an hundred but proves well, when of large Horſes, not one in a Thouſand; Nay, the middle ſized Horſe is the moſt propper for all uſes: For the Padd, Buck-hunting, Hauking, Running, Galloping upon the high way for many Miles, or Poſting, for the Coatch, for the Cart; Yea for any thing, and if he falleth, a little Horſe will do the Rider leſs hurt to ly upon him then a large and heavy one: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Geldings and Gelt Nages are fiter for great Journies, Hunting or Hauking in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, then Stoned Horſes, becauſe the natural heat in Stoned Horſes with the beat of the weather, doeth ſoon fire their Feet and fownder them, whereas Geldings are Colder, and ſo travel better, not becomming ſo ſoon weary in the heat of Summer. The great Inconveniency of Geldings is, that they ſoon diſguſt and looſs their appetite: But the only way to prevent it, is to make choice of ſuch as are well Bellied, and then they will keep their Stomachs pretty well, yet never ſo well as ſtoned Horſes.</p>
                     <p>As to the Age in which it is moſt propper to begin to work a Horſe either for the Warrs or Mannage; It is certain that a Young Horſe of three years old is but Griſle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his underſtanding if one may ſo ſpeak is not come to him, ſo that wanting under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and being ſo weak, you muſt have patience to ſtay three years more at the leaſt until he hath both, for ſtopping and going back will ſtrain his back, ſtreſs his Hams, and conſequently ſpoil him, ſo that I would rather have a Horſe of ſix, ſeven, or eight years old, ſo he be ſound and not vitious, then a Horſe only of three, for then I can force him and make him a ready Horſe in three months: But perhaps ſome will ſay, that as Boyes learn better then men, ſo will Colts learn better than Horſes, I anſwer no, for if men could be beaten to it as Boyes are, they would learn much better &amp; ſooner: but I can force a Horſe of theſe years, who having both underſtanding and ſtrength, will, and muſt of neceſſity learn much ſooner and better, then if he were younger.</p>
                     <p>Again, If you would have a Horſe of uſe for ordinary occaſions, as Journeying, Hauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would adviſe you to buy one who is alreadie almoſt paſt mark; and if he be ſound of wind, Limb and Sight, he will laſt you eight or nine years with good keeping, and never fail you; when a young horſe will have many diſeaſes, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have, and you muſt leave him with your Hoſt, and hire another for your occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have your Hoſts Bill, and the Farriers to pay at your return, which perhaps will come to more than your horſe is worth, and there is your young horſe, but your old horſe ſhall never fail you: I would therefore alwayes buy for ſuch purpoſes, an old Naig of ſome Hunts-man or Falconer, which I know to be ſound, and that is the uſefull Nage; For he gallops on all Grounds, leaps over Ditches, and Hedges, and will not fail you in your Journey not any where, and is the only Nage of uſe for pleaſure or Journey: But not for a Souldiers horſe, or the Mannage, for every horſe ſhould be appropriat to what he is moſt fit for.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>FOR the Sadle, Cavezon, Stirrops and Spurs,<note place="margin">CHAP. X.</note> you will ſee the figures of them live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in the following Plate, which is the fourth, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of them in this place.</p>
                     <p>As for the Girths, I would adviſe you to have one Girth as broad as two, or two ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and only ſeperat about three inches at each end, as if they were two, though being thus joined together they appear to be but one, as alſo an <hi>Italian Surcingle</hi> over
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179659:169"/>them, which is ſo excellent a thing, that if the Girths or Straps ſhould break, yet the <hi>Surcingle</hi> will not fail to hold.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo fit your horſe with a Bitt proper for him, to know which ſhall be taught you more diſtinctly in the thirteenth Chapter, and with the ſame Bitt which you give him at firſt, <hi>I</hi> would have you alwayes ride him, unleſs you find an abſolute neceſſitie to alter it, your horſe ſhould be ſo hard girt, as to keep the Sadle fixt and from turning: For the <hi>Italians</hi> ſay, <hi>he who girds well Rides well,</hi> but a Groom may gird well and yet not ride well, therefore they mean no man can ride well who doth not gird well; For how can he ſit fixt when the Sadle turns round? Horſes of Mannage force alſo the Girths, a great dale more than Journey horſes do, becauſe of the violence of their Ayres. And I muſt tell you, that you ſhould never gird up your horſes hard and ſtrait, but juſt as you are going to mount them, for being a long time hard girt in the ſtable before you ride, they are apt to grow very ſick with it.</p>
                     <p>But why do they not alſo grow ſick with it when they ride ſay you? I'le tell you why, becauſe the violence of their exerciſe maketh them put out their Bodys, and ſo ſtreatches the Girths and makes them eaſier; There is a cunning alſo which Horſes make uſe of when they are accuſtomed to be hard girt, and it is this, when the Groom cometh to gird them up, they will ſo ſtreach out their Bodies and Bellies with holding in their Breath, that he will have much adoe to gird them, and then when the Groom is gone they let their Bodies fall again, which is very craftily done of them, that they may have eaſe after they are girded. And yet ſay the Learned, <hi>like to the Horſe who hath no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> but although they will allow it no other Name then inſtinct, yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct hath the ſame effect in horſes as reaſon hath in Men, ſo that it is only to diſput the name and not the thing, becauſe this inſtinct is found to be as infallible and to fail and miſtake it ſelf as ſeldom, as Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Another thing I am to advertiſe you of, Is that you make the Noſe-band as ſtrait as poſſible you can, becauſe it hinders him to make ſheers with his mouth, as they ſay, or to gape and diſorder the working of the Bitt, or to bite at your Leggs or Rod, when you help him with it, but the Noſe-band being very ſtrait makes the Bitt ly in its due place, and work orderly as it ought, both upon the Barrs and Crub, and ſo firms and ſetles his head; And I aſſure you there is nothing better then this for many things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> would have alſo the Cavezon tyed as ſtrait as you can, for the ſame Reaſons, but remember that your Cavezon be never ſharp, but alwayes lined with double Leath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at leaſt, for fear of hurting him, and though the old Saying is, <hi>A Bloody Noſe makes a good Mouth,</hi> yet I would neither hurt his Mouth nor Noſe, nor any thing elſe about him, if I could help it; and then I am ſure he will have a better Mouth, than if his Noſe were hurt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sakers, Dockes</hi> or <hi>Trouſe-Ques</hi> (which are all one) are very becoming for a Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horſe, for they make him appear Plumper, more together or <hi>Racourſi,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to go higher, therefore I would have you make uſe of them for all kind of Leaping Horſes, whither for <hi>Croupadoes, Balotadoes</hi> or <hi>Capriols,</hi> but then the horſes tails muſt be tyed up ſhort in the Sakers, for horſes that goe the Mannage <hi>de ſoldat, Terra a Terra,</hi> in <hi>Corvets,</hi> or <hi>Demy Ayres,</hi> there is nothing more becoming then to ſee them with good Tails, hanging naturally down without any thing upon them; and to ſee them ſweep the Ground with their Tails is Gracefull, and ſhoweth that they go upon their Haunches, which is the perfection of the Mannage; But if you intend to beautifie their Mains and Tails before great Princes, or Perſons of Qualitie, then there is nothing more gracefull then to tye their Mains with ſeveral collourd Ribbons, or all of one collour, and after different wayes, either plateing them or letting them hang looſe.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo obſerved, That Horſes do commonly become plain Furniture. (I mean Sadles and Bridles but not the <hi>Houſes</hi>) better then rich, therefore the Sadles ſhould be plain white <hi>Spaniſh Leather,</hi> and Silver Nailes, ſtitcht alſo with Silk, and a good black Leather ſlip-Cover over it, the Bridle ſoft black Leather and ſmall, by no means too broad, two Girths as I ſaid joyned in one, but parted at both ends like two, and a good <hi>Italian Surcingle,</hi> which will be worth both the Girths for ſure holding, you muſt be alſo very careful to ſee that nothing about your Horſe hurt him, as Sadle, Bridle, Cavezon, or any thing elſe, for aſſure your ſelf that ſo long as any thing hurts him, he will never go well.</p>
                     <p>Horſes alſo go very ſeldom well in a high wind, for it doth ſo whisk about them, blow into their ears, and make ſuch a Noiſe, as it mightily diverts them from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and ſo doth any new help, or other thing they are not accuſtomed to, for Horſes are very ſenſible and tickliſh kind of Creatures, and care for nothing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth new to them.</p>

                     <p>HAving in the preceeding Chapter given you an account of what Equipage is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for both Horſe and Rider, I think it will not be a miſs to give you in this,<note place="margin">CHAP: XI.</note> and before I proceed further in diſcourſing of the Art, ane exact Diſcription of the true Seat upon Horſeback, without which it is impoſſible for any Man to be an excellent Horſeman: And therefore before you mount your Horſe, you muſt ſee that every thing be in order about him, which you may do in an inſtant, without Peering and Prying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every thing, <hi>pour faire L'entendu,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ſay: And when you are in the Saddle, (for I ſuppoſe you know how to get up) you muſt ſit upon your Twiſt, and not on your Buttocks, though Nature hath made them for ſitting on every where elſe, but a Horſe back.</p>
                     <p>Being thus placed upon your Twiſt, and in the middle of the Sadle, advance your Belly towards the Pommel of it, as much as you can, leaving a handbreadth of ſpace, between your hinder parts &amp; the <hi>Cantle</hi> or <hi>L'Arſon</hi> of the Saddle, but keep your Shoulders a little back, your Leggs being ſtraight down, as if you were on Foot, and your Thighs and Knees turned inwards to the Saddle, holding faſt with them both, as if you were glewed to the Sadle (for a Horſeman hath nothing but thoſe two with the Counter-poiſe of his Body, to keep him on horſeback) plant your feet firmly upon the Stirrops, your heels a little lower then your Toes, and let the ends of your Toes paſs thorow the Stirrops a large Inch, or a little more; your hams ſtiff, and Leggs not too far from the Horſes ſides, nor too near neither; that is only ſo near as not to touch them, which is of great uſe for certain helps, which I ſhall ſhow you hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Reins of the Bridle are to be in the left Hand, your little finger ſeperating the Reins, and graſping the reſt in the Hand, with your Thumb upon the Reins, and your Arm pretty cloſe to your Body, but not conſtrained; the Bridle Hand juſt over the neek of the Horſe, and about three fingers above the Pommel, and two before it, that the Pommel may not hinder the Reins in their Working.</p>
                     <p>In the Right Hand you muſt have a <hi>whiſtling Rod,</hi> neither too long, like an <hi>Angling Rod,</hi> nor too ſhort like a <hi>Poincon;</hi> But if either, let it be rather ſhort as long, for there are many graceful helps, which may be given with a ſhort Rod, that a long one will not admite of, you muſt alſo hold it a little from the bigg end beyond your hand, not only to make much of your Horſe ſometimes with it, but alſo to hold it the faſter; and make the point of it bend a little inwards: Your Right Hand where the Rod is, ought to be a little before the Bridle Hand, and the Right Arm alſo a little looſer and more degadged from the Body then the left, but not too far from your Body neither.</p>
                     <p>You muſt look a little Gay and Pleaſant, but not laughing, and look directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Horſes Ears, when he goeth forward: I do not mean you ſhould be ſtiff as a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179659:172"/>Stake, or like to a Statue on Horſe-back, but much otherwayes, that is free and with all the Liberty in the World, and as the <hi>French</hi> ſay in Danſing, <hi>a la neglegence,</hi> So I would have a man on Horſe back <hi>En Cavalier,</hi> and not Formal, for that ſhowes more a Scholar than a Maſter, now a good Seat is of ſuch Conſequence as you ſhall ſee hereafter, that it is one of the chief things maketh a Horſe go perfectly; the very manner of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being almoſt beyond all other helps, therefore do not diſpiſe it; for I dare boldly ſay, that he who is not <hi>Bel homme a cheval,</hi> or a Handſome and Graceful Horſeman, ſhall never be <hi>Bon homme a Cheval,</hi> or a good Horſeman; And ſo this is enough for the Seat, of the Cavalier.

                     </head>
                     <p>NOtwithſtanding of the moſt exact Directions you have had in the Diſcourſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly preceeding this Treatiſe of Horſemanſhp,<note place="margin">CHAP<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> XIII.</note> for bitting all kinds of Horſes; I Judge it will not be amiſs, to make in this place a general Recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of what was more fully and at large ſet down in theſe directions, that ſo this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe may be both the more compleat of it ſelf, and alſo give you a general notion of what Bitts are moſt univerſally to be made uſe of, for all Horſes, who have not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very extraordinary in either their Mouths or Necks.</p>
                     <p>Now it ſeems the Generality of Horſemen long agoe, thought themſelves wiſe and great Maſters, by the Diverſity of Bitts which they made uſe of, in which they were mightily deceived: for can any Man imagine, that a piece of iron in a Horſes Mouthwill bring him Knowledge; no more I aſſure you, then a Book in a Boys hand will at firſt ſight make him read; or a pair of Spurrs planted on an Ignorants heels make him ride well. There is however I confeſs a Propriety or skill, in knowing how to fit a Horſes Bitt to him, according to the Turn of his Neck, the Branches either ſhorter or longer, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or weaker, Mouth and Liberty wider or narrower, the eye longer or ſhorter, ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or more bending, the Hooks according to the juſt Meaſure of the Bitt, the Curb equal and conſiſting of three good round Eſſes, with one ring where it is fixed to the eye upon the far ſide, and two Rings or Mallious, whereby it is Curbed or fixed upon the near ſide, the Cheeks of the Bitt handſomly furniſhed with boſſes, not too big, and either rich or plain according to your fancy; not two Rows of little Chains tyed to the Bitt within his Mouth, but only one at the moſt.</p>
                     <p>But above all, This Rule is chiefly to be obſerved, to put as little Iron in your Horſes Mouth as poſſibly you can. If his tongue be very bigg the Liberty muſt be the wider, if little, the Liberty the leſs; but you muſt take heed that the <hi>Apuy,</hi> or reſting place of the Bitt, be never made too near the Liberty for it would gall him; but the reſting place muſt be where it ought, which is about a fingers breadth from the Liberty upon each ſide of it, and the Bitt muſt reſt upon the Barrs a fingers breadth above the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: Thoſe branches are weakeſt, whoſe extreamities when the Reins are ſlackt, come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Horſes Neck, and thoſe ſtrongeſt, which go moſt forwards from his Neck, and good reaſon for it, becauſe you have the greater Pull: you may alſo meaſure with a little ſtring, or peice of a Rideing Rod, from the eye of the Bitt ſtraight down, and if the extremitys of the Branches be within that line, they are weak and Gentle, and the more they are within it, they are ſtill ſo much the Weaker, but if they be without it, then they are ſtrong or hardy, and the more they are without it, they are ſtill ſo much the more ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo conſider another thing which is, that the Cheecks are like to a <hi>Lever</hi> the longer it is it hath the more force, and the ſhorter it is it hath the leſs; for a Boy with a long Lever will lift up more, then the ſtrongeſt man with a ſhort and ſo in a Bitt the longer the branches are, they have the more force, and the ſhorter they are they have the leſs, for that which is the furtheſt from the Center, hath the moſt force for Lifting or Pulling, and that which is neareſt the Center the leaſt force, ſo that very ſhort branches make them as ſtrong or hardy as you will, can never have that force which longer Cheecks have.</p>
                     <p>Again, if a Horſe hold too much up his head and out, then they make uſe of ſhorter branches and ſtronger, to pull his head down and in, wherein they are pretty Right: and ſo if a Horſe hold his head too low, and bringeth it in ſo round that he arms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Bitt, which is to reſt the branches upon his breaſt, ſo that you have no further Pull or Command of him at all: and becauſe this vice is contrary to holding up his head and out, for which they uſed ſhort branches and ſtronger to bring it in, they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179659:173"/>therefore think they ſhould make uſe of long and weak Branches to pull it up; For they reaſon thus, that if a ſtrong Branch pulled him down, then a weak Branch will pull up his head: Wherein they are mightily deceived, for when a Horſe arms himſelf againſt the Bitt, as it is certain that long Branches will ſooner come to his Breaſt, then ſhort ones; ſo is it as certain that weak Branches will come ſooner to his Breaſt then thoſe which are ſtrong; but it ſeems this they do not very exactly conſider, otherwayes they would be very ſoon ſenſible of their errour.</p>
                     <p>For to a Horſe that arms himſelf againſt the Bit, you muſt have not only a ſhort branch that will not ſo ſoon touch his breaſt, but alſo a ſtrong branch to keep it yet further from his breaſt: the hooks of the Curb ought likewiſe to be made a little longer, and ſo juſtly turned, as not to offend or hurt the ſides of of his Cheecks, and if the Curb doth not ly in its right place, two little iron Rings faſtned cloſs to the Top of the Hooks, to keep them ſteady and fixed, is the beſt Remedy: all other devices in Bitts or Curbs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſignificant and to little purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Now the Bitts following are generally the beſt for all Horſes whatſoever, <hi>Viz.</hi> Firſt, A <hi>plain or ſimple Canon,</hi> with Branches <hi>a La Coneſtable.</hi> Secondly, A plain <hi>Seatch</hi> with branches a <hi>La Coneſtable.</hi> Thirdly, a Canon <hi>a La Pignatel,</hi> which is a Bitt with a gentle falling and moving up and down, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> ſo low as not to hurt the Roof of the Horſes mouth, which is the beſt Bitt certainly for all Horſes which have any thing of a big Tongue, which I am ſure they do not like to have preſſed; and therefore I recommend that <hi>Liberty</hi> above all things in Bitts, with the branches <hi>a La Coneſtable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To diſcharge a Horſes lips, I would have <hi>Olives,</hi> with the Liberty <hi>a La Pignatel,</hi> thoſe <hi>Olives</hi> extending not ſo far upon every ſide of the Mouth, as to the extremitys of them, and having little Rings at the ends of them, give Liberty to his Lips and diſcharges them; but indeed I would have of all, but two ſorts of Bitts, which are firſt the <hi>Canon a la Pignatel,</hi> and ſecondly the <hi>Olives a la Pignatel</hi> to diſcharge his Lipps if need be, but the branches alwayes <hi>a la Coneſtable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you have the Truth of Bitts brought into a narrow compaſs: There is little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them to bring a Horſe to underſtanding, on which a man muſt work, and that is his Reaſon, by the favour of the <hi>Logitians</hi> diſtinction of reaſonable and unreaſonable Creatures, for were they as good Horſemen as Scholars, they would have made another diſtinction: Well then, you ſee it is not a peice of Iron can make a Horſe knowing, for if it were, the <hi>Bitt-makers</hi> would be the beſt Horſemen: No, it is the Art of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Leſſons, fitting every Horſe according to his Nature, Diſpoſition and Strength; puniſhing, and with good Leſſons rectifying his Vices; rewarding him, and preſerving him in his Horſe Vertues, which will make him a Juſt and ready Horſe: and not the Truſting to an ignorant peice of Iron, <hi>called a Bitt:</hi> For I will undertake to make a perfect Horſe with a <hi>Cavezon</hi> without a <hi>Bitt,</hi> better then any man ſhall with his <hi>Bitt</hi> without a <hi>Cavezon,</hi> ſo highly is the <hi>Cavezon</hi> when rightly uſed, to be eſteemed; and that is the true Art which maketh a Horſe, and not the Ignorance and Folly of a ſtrange Figured Bitt.</p>
                     <p>The Famous <hi>Pignatel</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> never uſed but ſimple Bitts, which made the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant wonder how he could Dreſs Horſes ſo perfectly with ſo few kinds of Bitts; but he freely told them, <hi>It was their Ignorance made them wonder at his Art:</hi> And ſo likewayes that great Maſter in this Art, <hi>Monſieur de Pluvinel,</hi> did the ſome, for he had alwayes a plain <hi>Cavezon,</hi> and not too ſharp, and to make it yet the Gentler, did alwayes line it with double Leather at leaſt; again working with the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> and making uſe of ſuch Bitts as I have named to you, It rarely falleth out that a Horſe either wryes his Head, ſucks up his Bitt, or puts his Tongue over the Bitt, becauſe the liberty <hi>a la Pignatel</hi> hindereth his Tongue from going over the Bitt, which is the one, and the working with the <hi>Cavezon</hi> tyed to the Pommel of the Saddle, as I ſhall hereafter ſhow you, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Head, and ſo preventeh the other. And this much in general for the right Bitting of a Horſe; Thoſe who are more curious, may turn back to the diſcourſe of <hi>Bitts</hi> immediatly preceeding this Treatiſe of Horſemanſhip, where they will be ſatisfied to the full, in every particular circumſtance which can poſſibly occur in the fitting of any kind of Horſe with a <hi>Bitt,</hi> ſee Plate ſecond and third.</p>

                        <p>TO Work regularly with the <hi>Reins</hi> of the Bridle, which work upon the Bitt,<note place="margin">CHAP: XIV.</note> is an Art which requireth a great deal of more conſideration and Judgement, then many who underſtand it not do imagine, for you muſt conſider that the Bitt is an Engine which worketh upon the Horſes <hi>Barrs</hi> and the <hi>Curb,</hi> and the two <hi>Branches</hi> are like <hi>Leavers</hi> to work on theſe two places accordingly as the <hi>Reins</hi> pull the Cheeks; The <hi>Barrs</hi> and the place where the <hi>Curb</hi> reſteth, are much lower then the Noſe upon which the <hi>Cavezon</hi> worketh, and the Rings whereto the <hi>Reins</hi> of the Bridle are faſtned at the end of the Cheeks, are alſo lower then either the <hi>Barrs</hi> or the <hi>Curb,</hi> but as the <hi>Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are pulled by the <hi>Reins</hi> of the Bridle, ſo doeth the Bitt work upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> or the <hi>Curb</hi> upon the place where it reſteth.</p>
                        <p>I muſt alſo tell you that the <hi>Branches</hi> ly ſlope to you, and the <hi>Reins</hi> more ſlope before you take them into your hand: So the Bitt cannot preſs very much upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> the Bridle hand and <hi>Reins</hi> being ſo farr from the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> line to the <hi>Branches;</hi> The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular</hi> Line is, when you thruſt your Bridle hand ſo far forewards as that it is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular</hi> to the ends of the Cheeks, which maketh you have a fuller pull of the <hi>Branches,</hi> and conſequently maketh them work extreamly upon the <hi>Curb:</hi> So when a Horſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtraight forewards either Trotting, Galloping, or upon <hi>Corvets,</hi> if you hold your hand low, the Bitt preſſes more upon the <hi>Barrs</hi> then the <hi>Curb,</hi> becauſe the Cheeks of it are not ſo much pulled to you, or towards the neck of the Horſe, and conſequently the <hi>Curb</hi> is not ſtraitned ſo much, and the Horſe is at more liberty, and his head a little high, but when you hold your Bridle hand a little more forewards, and pull it upwards, then the <hi>Curb</hi> worketh more, and ſo pulleth down the Horſes head: Now the reaſon of this is plain, for when you pull the <hi>Branches</hi> hard and up, then you pull the mouth of the Bitt down, and ſo the Horſes head alſo, becauſe the <hi>Branches</hi> work hard upon the <hi>Curb,</hi> for it is moſt true, that when the Cheeks of the Bitt are pulled up, the mouth goeth down, and ſtraitens the <hi>Curb,</hi> the hand being high, and when the <hi>Branches</hi> are not pulled hard, then the <hi>Curb</hi> is a little ſlackt, and the Horſes head at more liberty; becauſe the preſſure of the <hi>Bitt</hi> upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and of the <hi>Curb</hi> upon the place where it reſteth, dependeth upon the <hi>Branches;</hi> for when the <hi>Branches</hi> go up, the Mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goeth down, and when the <hi>Branches</hi> go down, the Mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goeth up; this is the true Operation and Effect of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> when a Horſe goeth ſtraight forwards.</p>

                        <p>Therefore in <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> the <hi>Reins</hi> ſeperated one in each hand; I pull the inward <hi>Rein</hi> (if I am going to the Right hand) ſlopwayes over his neck, towards my left ſhoulder, the Knuckles of my Right hand down, and Nails up, which pulleth the inward Cheek towards me, and as it were without the <hi>Turn,</hi> and then the mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> bendeth into the <hi>Turn,</hi> and maketh the Horſe alſo look into the <hi>Turn,</hi> preſleth his leggs which are without the <hi>Turn,</hi> and giveth liberty to thoſe within: Which is the true action of a Horſes Leggs, for <hi>Terra a Terra.</hi>

                        <p>The inward <hi>Rein</hi> likewayes pulled thus when you have both the <hi>Reins</hi> in the Left hand, worketh the very ſame effect: For going to the Right hand, if you turn your Knuckles quite down, making your Nails as it were reſpect a little your left ſhoulder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtreatch the inward <hi>Rein,</hi> by this motion of the inward <hi>Rein</hi> You pull the inward <hi>Branch</hi> to you, and as it were out of the <hi>Turn,</hi> and then the mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goeth into the <hi>Turn,</hi> and preſſing the Horſe upon the inſide of the <hi>Barrs,</hi> maketh him both look into the <hi>Turn,</hi> and alſo preſſeth his leggs without the <hi>Volt,</hi> and giveth liberty to thoſe within, all which is moſt proper for <hi>Terra a Terra:</hi> Now what I have ſaid of the Right hand, may be eaſily applyed to the Left, and this much of the inward <hi>Rein,</hi> either both <hi>Reins</hi> being in the Left hand, or the <hi>Reins</hi> being ſeperate, and one only in each hand.</p>

                     <p>Conſider alſo, That when the inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> is tyed to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the Saddle, it maketh almoſt the ſame oblique line as when you hold it in your hand, and hath the ſame opperation in every thing, only that it is a little ſhorter: But then again if you hold it in your hand, and pull it ſtrongly on the inſide of the <hi>Volt,</hi> and low, then you pull down the Horſes head, which maketh him bring in his outward ſhoulder, which is good upon large Circles, either in Troting, Galloping or Paſſaging, for to ſupple his Shoulders, ſo that the <hi>Cavezon</hi> and <hi>Bitt</hi> differ ſo much in working, that when you pull the <hi>Cavezon Rien</hi> a little high, it bringeth alſo up the Horſes head, and when you pull the <hi>Branches</hi> high, your hand well advanced and near to the <hi>perpendicular</hi> line of the <hi>Branches,</hi> they bring the Horſes head down, again when you hold the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezon rein</hi> low, and towards the inſide of the turn, it pulleth his head down, but if you hold your Bridle-hand low, it giveth his head liberty.</p>
                     <p>You may perceive then by this, that the <hi>Cavezon</hi> and <hi>Bitt</hi> differ very much in their manner of Operation, ſo great is the difference between working upon the Noſe, and the mouth or <hi>Barrs;</hi> It is true that the <hi>cavezons</hi> inwards <hi>Rein</hi> tyed to the <hi>pommel</hi> of the Saddle, is ſo rare and ſo effectual a thing, as you need not almoſt care what you do with the <hi>Bitt</hi> ſo long as yow work with it, becauſe it indeed doth all, yet when a Man cometh to work with the Briddle alone, he may eaſily be miſtaken, for except he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the true effects of both, the excellency of the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>rein</hi> thus tyed, may very readily deceive him, when he cometh to work with the <hi>Bitt</hi> alone.</p>

                     <p>Now the great uſe of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> is to ſtay, to raiſe, and make a Horſe Light, to teach him to turn, to ſtop, and to aſſure and adjuſt his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Croup,</hi> and alſo ply his Neck, and ſupple his Shoulders and fore Legs, without offending his Mouth, or place of the <hi>Curb;</hi> therefore I would adviſe you to uſe it to all Horſes whatſoever, for they will go much better, when you come to make uſe of the <hi>Bitt</hi> alone; having their Mouths thereby preſerved and made ſo ſenſible, that they will be attentive to the leaſt motions of the Hand; ſo that there is nothing comparable to it for the Exerciſe of the Mannage, with a <hi>Bitt</hi> for the moſt part <hi>a la Pignatel,</hi> and the Branches <hi>a la Coneſtable;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Cavezon</hi> doth ſo ſupple them, and is ſo right, that it will dreſs all Horſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, if you work them upon their Trot, Gallop, Stopping, and going back, with <hi>Paſſaging,</hi> and raiſing them as you ought, conform to the Rules of Art, for this mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſubject to the ſenſe of Feeling, cauſing them to Feel and Anſwer the Hand and Heels, which is the Senſe we ought to work on, and not to the Senſe of the Sight, which is the <hi>Routin</hi> of the <hi>Pillars,</hi> or the Senſe of Noiſe, which is the <hi>Rote</hi> of <hi>Hearing,</hi> and that only by applying the <hi>Aids</hi> in theſe two places, to wit, the Mouth and the Sides: Seeing is all the Art by which People teach Horſes <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Gambals,</hi> and though the Ignorant admire them; yet theſe perſons ſhall never teach a Horſe to go well in the Mannage; for there are many things in the Senſe of Feeling which are to be done with ſo great Art and Judgement, and which require ſo great Experience of the different Diſpoſitions of Horſes, that it is not every man who can Dreſs a Horſe for the Mannage, as he can make a Dog or Horſe to Dance.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>rein</hi> tyed ſhort to the <hi>pommel</hi> of the ſaddle, is excellent to give a horſe an <hi>Apuy,</hi> ſettle him upon the hand, and make his head firm and ſteady; ſo it is excellent for a horſe that is too hard on the hand, for the <hi>cavezons rein</hi> within the <hi>turn</hi> being alwayes tyed very ſtrait to the <hi>pommel,</hi> keepeth him from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much upon the <hi>Bitt,</hi> which makes him Light and firm on the hand, the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezons</hi> inward <hi>rein</hi> being thus tyed ſhort is alſo excellent to ſupple a horſes ſhoulders, which is the beſt thing that can be; for it giveth <hi>Apuy</hi> where there is none, and where there is too much it takes it away, and ſuppleth his ſhoulders extreamly, which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing; it alſo maketh a Horſe Gallop very right with his Leggs for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> for it in a manner lengthens his Leggs within the Turn, and giveth them liberty; but ſhortens and preſſeth his Leggs without the turn, which is as they ſhould be for <hi>terra a terra:</hi> So you ſee that the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>Rein</hi> thus fixed to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> is good Firſt for ſuppling his ſhoulders, helping him with your inward Legg, and outward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle:</hi> And next for working his <hi>Croup,</hi> helping him with your outward Legg and inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle;</hi> and this is the verity of tying the <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> inward <hi>Rein</hi> ſhort to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle.</hi>

                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:179659:176"/>to bring in his Shoulders, and narrow him before, if the <hi>Piroite,</hi> only with the outward <hi>rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> if <hi>Demp Volts</hi> upon <hi>Paſſades,</hi> the outward <hi>rein;</hi> for all <hi>Leaps, Corvets</hi> either forwards or backwards, or upon the <hi>Volts,</hi> and <hi>Demp Aìres,</hi> ſtill the outward <hi>rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> for the moſt part; but for <hi>terra a terra,</hi> or <hi>paſſads-terra a terra,</hi> ſtopping and going back, you muſt help with the inward <hi>rein</hi> and outward Legg; and all this with the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>rein</hi> tyed ſtrait to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> which is the beſt thing in the World; for being ſo fixed, you ſee how you may give your helps which the ſeveral <hi>reins</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> as occaſion ſhall offer, and as I have told you in theſe ſeveral <hi>Ayres</hi> preceeding.</p>
                     <p>So that the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>rein</hi> held in your hand, or thus tyed to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> which is certainly the moſt ſecure way, is for all things whatſoever, <hi>Croup</hi> in or out, <hi>Trot, Gallop, Paſſage,</hi> all <hi>Ayres, Stopping, going back, Paſſads,</hi> or any thing elſe that belongeth to the Mannage; for without it no Horſe can have his Shoulders well Suppled, his Neck made plyable to look into the Turn, his Leggs to go right, or agree as they ſhould in every different Action, or his Body rightly bent to be part of the Circle, wherein he is going; And conſequently without a <hi>Cavezon</hi> can never be perfectly dreſſed, therefore it is all in all for every thing, every <hi>Ayre,</hi> and every <hi>Action</hi> a Horſe can make; for it preſerves his <hi>Mouth, Barrs,</hi> and place of the <hi>Curb,</hi> and is ſo effectual that it will Dreſs a Horſe without the <hi>Bitt,</hi> which a <hi>Bitt</hi> ſhall never do ſo well without the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> for the <hi>Barrs</hi> and place of the <hi>Curb</hi> are tender, beſides, the <hi>reins</hi> of the <hi>Bitt</hi> can never ſo well Supple his Shoulders, ply his Neck, or give his Body that <hi>Juſt Bent</hi> which is required in the Mannage, becauſe they are ſo near to you, and work only upon the <hi>barrs</hi> and <hi>Curb,</hi> which cannot poſſibly bend him ſo much as that which is upon his Noſe, for the <hi>barrs</hi> and <hi>Curb</hi> are low, and the <hi>branches</hi> yet lower, ſo that there is not ſo much room and diſtance to pull, as with the <hi>Cavezon</hi> that is ſo much higher; and hath the diſtance from the very Noſe to the Shoulders, where you may pull him; whereas the <hi>Bridle-reins</hi> can but pull his <hi>Muſle</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> but ſcarcely any more: For to Supple his Shoulders with the <hi>Bridle Reins,</hi> you muſt help with the inward Legg and outward <hi>rein,</hi> and ſtay his outward Shoulder with the inward <hi>rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> which hath not near that force which the inward <hi>rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> hath.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I would adviſe you, to uſe it for all things, and to all Horſes, Colts, half Dreſſed Horſes, Ready Horſes, Young, middle-aged, and Old, and in ſhort to every Horſe whatſover, for there is no Dreſſing of them without it but with great difficulty; and with it you will Dreſs all Horſes, of what Diſpoſition ſo ever, weak, middle ſtrength, or ſtrong; and with it alſo reduce all Vices, and when you come to uſe the <hi>Bitt</hi> alone, they will go much the better, for having been continually wrought before with the <hi>Cavezon.</hi>

                        <p>YOU muſt underſtand,<note place="margin">CHAP: XVII.</note> that the Body on Horſeback is divided into three parts, two Moveable, and one Unmoveable: The firſt Moveable is the upper parts of the Body to the Waſt, the Unmoveable is from the Waſt to the Knees; and the other Moveable, from the Knees to the Feet.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Helps</hi> of the Body are to be Gentle for all Horſes, becauſe to ſit ſtrong on Horſeback Aſtoniſhes a weak Horſe, And cauſes a ſtrong one to go in <hi>Counter-times,</hi> becauſe it forces him too much, it maketh a Furious Horſe mad, a reſty Horſe yet more Reſty, and a Horſe hard on the Hand to run away; Being diſpleaſing to all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179659:176"/>ſorts of Horſes: You are therefore neither to ſit too weak, nor too ſtrong upon Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, but betwixt the two, becauſe Gentle <hi>Helps</hi> fit and pleaſe all Horſes beſt; And you muſt alſo fit Straight upon the <hi>Twiſt,</hi> and alwayes keep your ſelf as much ſo as you can, what action ſoever the Horſe maketh: And to do it with the more eaſe, you muſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his rude and unexpected motions, by acting quite contrary to what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As for example, If the Horſe riſe before, then you muſt incline your Body a little forewards to him; For did your Body go along with the Horſe, it would go backwards, and be both very uneaſie for you and the Horſe: In like manner, if the Horſe ſtrike out behind, or raiſe his <hi>Croup,</hi> you muſt put your Body backwards, which is contrary to the Horſes motion; For did you follow the Horſe, you would put your Body fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo be in danger of being thrown, therefore the beſt way, is ſtill to ſit ſtraight as much as poſſible, and then the Action of the Horſe will keep you on your <hi>Twiſt.</hi>

                        <p>THE voice is uſed three manner of wayes, <hi>Firſt</hi> for correction, which is done in a threatning way, and is good in the beginning to aſtoniſh and Allarum any ill natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Malicious Horſes, which with all their might Rebel againſt their Rider. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is made uſe of, as an <hi>Aid</hi> or <hi>Help,</hi> and to Incourage Horſes when they are doing what the Rider would have them. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is made uſe of as a token of kindneſs, and to court and flatter them: But it is never otherwayes made uſe of, except in theſe three caſes I have told you, and but ſeldom in theſe neither, becauſe it is not by the ſence of heating, or ſeeing, but by the ſence of feeling or touch, and hand and heel, that Horſes are perfectly dreſſed: However, I do not condem themakng uſe of the <hi>Voice</hi> at Seaſonable times, that ſo you may gain upon and overcome ſuch Horſes as are vitious, and ill natured, or who incline to reſt by refuſing the Spurr; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the beginning it Succeedeth very oft well, but when once a Horſe is come any length in his Mannage, it muſt then no more be made uſe of.</p>
                        <p>As for the help of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> it is admirable for Incouraging and animating, or bringing a Horſe together, and uniting him in <hi>Terra a Terra;</hi> You ſhould therefore from time to time alwayes make uſe of it. But there is nothing more rediculous then to ſee ſome people, who ſo ſoon as ever they have begun their <hi>Repriſe</hi> of <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> never ceaſe <hi>Claking</hi> with their <hi>Tongue</hi> untill they have finiſhed it, which ſerveth for no other uſe but to dull a Horſe, and make him unſenſible: However, to make uſe of the <hi>Tongue</hi> ſometimes produceth a every good effect, eſpecially in all kind of <hi>Ayres:</hi> But I muſt here reprehend a certain kind of people, who ſo ſoon as ever they ſee any Horſe ſlaken in his Mannage, who ever be upon his back, or that he goeth not as they would have him, never fail to ſpeak or <hi>Clake</hi> to him with their <hi>Tongue,</hi> which is very impertinent in him who doth it, for not being the Rider, it is not very good manners to ſpeak to to the Horſe, except he belongeth to the perſon who ſpeaketh; for if the Horſe do not belong to him, and that he ſtill <hi>Clake</hi> to him with his <hi>Tongue</hi> ſo long as he Rideth, he will be thought but very officious and rediculous upon that head: Thoſe who are guilty of this will be perhaps better ſatisfied to receive this advice in Writing, then by word of mouth, at leaſt I would be ſo, were the caſe my own.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Rod</hi> is ſeldom uſed for a Correction, but only for a <hi>Help,</hi> and that many times alſo more for Grace then uſe: For one <hi>Rod</hi> ſhould ſerve a Man a month, becauſe it is the hand and Heels that dreſs a Horſe, and nothing elſe; alſo the <hi>Helps</hi> with the <hi>Rod</hi> are not ſo proper for Souldiers Horſes, becauſe they ſhould go only with the hand and heel, for the Sword is to be in the Right hand, and not the <hi>Rod,</hi> but in dreſſing a Horſe only for the Warrs, you muſt at firſt uſe the <hi>Rod,</hi> if it were but only to ſhow it ſtill upon the contrary ſide to which he is going, or to hold it ſtraight up with a grace at every change.</p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:179659:177"/>
                        <p>2ly, <hi>Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the</hi> Rod <hi>in</hi> Terra a Terra.</p>
                        <p>FOR <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> upon the Right hand, hold up your <hi>Rod</hi> pretty high with a <hi>Grace,</hi> and give him ſometimes a gentle blow upon the left ſhoulder if there be need for it, or ſometimes over your left Arm, upon the ſide or Flank if he require it.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> upon the left hand, hold the <hi>Rod</hi> alſo a little high, or put it to his Right Flank, and hold it there with a Grace during his <hi>repriſe,</hi> or give him a blow with it, upon the Right Flank or ſhoulder as he ſhall require it.</p>
                        <p>You muſt alſo uſe the ſame helps with the <hi>Rod,</hi> upon <hi>Demy Volts,</hi> or <hi>Paſſads,</hi> but for the <hi>piroite,</hi> hold it ſtill upon the <hi>contrary ſide</hi> to which he is going.</p>
                        <p>3ly, <hi>Of the uſe of the</hi> Rod <hi>in</hi> Corvets.</p>
                        <p>FOR <hi>Corvets</hi> upon the <hi>Volts,</hi> and going to the right hand, help him croſs the Neck upon his left ſhoulder with a Grace, and give him now and then a pretty ſmart blow, if he require it, or that you find he do not riſe well enough before; but going <hi>Corvets</hi> to the left, you muſt help him upon the right ſhoulder, alſo with a Grace and in juſt time.</p>
                        <p>Another help with the Rod in <hi>Corvets,</hi> is to hold it a little long, and to whisk it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and backwards, your Arm up and bending a little at the Elbow: But there is not a more Graceful help with the <hi>Rod</hi> in <hi>Corvets,</hi> then when you are going ſtreight forwards upon them, and your Horſes right ſide to a Wall; to ſtrike the Wall frequently, and in <hi>Cadance</hi> with the motion of the Horſe, a double ſtrock at each time.</p>
                        <p>4ly, <hi>Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the</hi> Rod <hi>in all manner of</hi> Leaps.</p>
                        <p>TO Whisk the <hi>Rod</hi> forwards and backwards in <hi>Leaps,</hi> as I deſired you to do in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets,</hi> is a very Graceful help; but in my Opinion it forces a Horſe a little too much forwards, until he be accuſtomed to it; to help alſo in <hi>Leaps</hi> with the <hi>Rod,</hi> not over your right ſhoulder, but over the bent of your right Arm, your Arm lying a little degadged from your Body, and ſo plyed, as that the point of the <hi>Rod</hi> may fall in the middle of the Horſes <hi>Croup;</hi> this is a Graceful help, yet ſomewhat difficult to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>But the beſt and ſureſt help, although not altogether ſo Graceful, is to turn the <hi>Rod</hi> in your hand, the point towards the Horſes <hi>Croup,</hi> and help him ſo each <hi>Leap</hi> and in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> but only one ſtroak at a time; yet if he raiſes not his <hi>Croup</hi> enough, then help him with two or three ſtroaks for each <hi>Leap,</hi> which is called in <hi>French, aider de tout temps,</hi> and this is the ſureſt help of all; you may alſo help him juſt behind the <hi>Saddle,</hi> with the big end of the <hi>Rod</hi> in place of a <hi>Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>on</hi> or <hi>Puncheon;</hi> the <hi>Rod</hi> being turned in your Hand as before, which is alſo a good help and very frequently made uſe of in the Schools.</p>
                        <p>But if your Horſe be very light behind, which few are, then help him only with the Rod upon the Shoulders, and in time; If you would make your Horſe only to <hi>Croup</hi> with his hinder parts, which is for the <hi>Balotade;</hi> and not ſtrick out but only ſhow his Shoes, then help him juſt upon the Middle of his <hi>Croup;</hi> But if you would have him ſtrick out, then help him with your <hi>Rod,</hi> upon the ſetting on of his <hi>Dock,</hi> and if you would have him bring both his hinder Leggs under his Belly, which is for the <hi>Croupade</hi> then ſtrick him with the Rod a little above the <hi>Gambrels.</hi> So theſe three ſeveral helps with the Rod, will make your horſe either to <hi>Balotade, ſtrike out,</hi> or <hi>Croupade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there is no help with the <hi>Rod</hi> ſo good, as to help him with two <hi>Rods,</hi> one to raiſe him before, and the other to help him under his belly, which putteth him ſo much upon the <hi>Haunches,</hi> as no help with the <hi>Rod</hi> is comparable to it, eſpecially when he is going upon <hi>Corvets,</hi> but then you muſt have a Perſon upon foot, who hath Judgement enough to give the help with the <hi>Rod</hi> beneath his Belly, in <hi>Juſt time</hi> and <hi>Cadance,</hi> otherwiſe it will more confound and aſtoniſh the horſe then aſſiſt him, and this much of the <hi>Rod.</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Correction</hi> of the <hi>Spurrs</hi> being a Puniſhment, cometh commonly after a fault is committed, to put either in his <hi>Croup</hi> or <hi>Buttock,</hi> when he ſhall have put it too far out, or out his <hi>Croup</hi> when he ſhall have put it too much in, or be <hi>Entier as the French call it,</hi> which is to refuſe to turn to that hand you would have him, and this is done commonly with one <hi>Spurr;</hi> but he is to be corrected with both <hi>Spurrs,</hi> when he is <hi>Reſty</hi> and will not go forwards, or to ſettle him on the hand, when he joggles his head, or when he is apprehenſive and <hi>skittiſh,</hi> or that he offereth to bite or ſtrike, in all theſe Caſes the <hi>Spurrs</hi> will do him good, alſo if he riſe too high before, or bolt upright, then to give him with both your <hi>Spurrs</hi> as he is falling down, will be a great means to put it from him, but take heed not to make uſe of them juſt as he is riſing, for then they may cauſe him come over upon you: Again if he will not <hi>Advance</hi> which is to riſe before, then a good ſtrock with both <hi>Spurrs</hi> will make him riſe, providing that at the ſame time, you keep him firm and ſtayed upon the hand, and as it were ſupport him a little with the <hi>Bitt,</hi> likewiſe if he be a <hi>dull Jade,</hi> or lazy and ſlack in his Mannage, then to give him the <hi>Spurrs</hi> will quicken him.</p>

                        <p>If your Horſe maliciouſly Rebel againſt what you would have him do, leave not <hi>Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of him, and that ſoundly, until you find him begin to obey you; and when he obeys you in the leaſt, then light off and ſend him to the Stable, and the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing try him again, and if he obey you, Cheriſh and make much of him, forgiving him many other faults that day, that he may know you have <hi>Mercy</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtice;</hi> And that you can <hi>Reward</hi> as well as <hi>Puniſh;</hi> ſo you ſee of what great Efficacy the <hi>Spurrs</hi> timely and diſcreetly given, are for the dreſſing of Horſes, for a man hath but his hand and heels to do it, and the <hi>Spurrs</hi> do half the buſineſs, although it muſt be confeſſed that the hand hath the preheminency; For though there be two <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and but one <hi>Bridle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Horſe hath but one mouth, and two ſides: Yet if he be not ſettled upon the hand, you cannot make him ſubject to the Heels, but withall, the <hi>Correction</hi> of the <hi>Spurrs</hi> is ſo neceſſary and effectual, that no Horſe can be made very ready without them, therefore eſteem them highly, nixt to ſettling a Horſe upon the hand, which muſt alwayes be firſt.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179659:178"/>and <hi>pinch</hi> him with the <hi>ſpurrs,</hi> which you may eaſily do, even to bring blood and no Body perceive it, for it ought to be done nearly and delicately, becauſe the <hi>ſpurrs</hi> are a neat and moſt excellent <hi>Help,</hi> and the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of all <hi>Helps</hi> in the Mannage, ſo that if a Horſe ſuffer and obey this while you <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However, you may <hi>Pinch</hi> with both your <hi>Spurrs</hi> at once, or only one of them as you find it needful, and that as well in <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> as other <hi>Ayres:</hi> now the uſe of <hi>Pinching</hi> in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> is to make him <hi>Croup,</hi> preſs him foreward, and put him much upon his <hi>Haunehes;</hi> whereas for all <hi>Ayres,</hi> it raiſeth him, and puteth him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards but a little, and therefore it is a great deal more proper for <hi>Ayres</hi> then <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> although it be very uſeful for both when rightly timed, and thus much of that excellent <hi>Help</hi> called <hi>Pinching</hi>

                     <p>Yet <hi>Pluvinel,</hi> and moſt of the great Maſters in Horſemanſhip, praiſe alwayes Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Flatteties, and making much of Horſes, either by Claping, Stroaking, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>But truly I never knew almoſt any Horſe, but before he was perfectly Dreſſed, would Rebel either leſs or more, and certainly there is no Horſe but will ſtrive at the firſt when Dreſſing, to have his own will, rather then to obey his Riders, nor doth a Horſe more as any other Creature love <hi>Subjection,</hi> until there is no <hi>Remedy,</hi> and then he will obey, and the Cuſtome of Obedience maketh him a <hi>Ready Horſe.</hi>

                        <p>The true <hi>Motion</hi> then of a Horſes Leggs upon his <hi>Walk,</hi> according to my own <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which upon tryal will be found to be as true as it is new, is one, two, three, and four, as followeth, the horſe when he beginneth his <hi>walk,</hi> muſt either <hi>lead</hi> with the Leggs of his Right fide, or with theſe of the left, if he <hi>Lead</hi> with thoſe of the Right, then the firſt foot he lifteth is his <hi>farr hind foot,</hi> which maketh one, and in the time he is ſetting it down (which in a ſtep he doth alwayes ſhort of the tread of his <hi>fore foot</hi> upon the ſame ſide) I ſay in the very time he is ſetting down his <hi>farr hind foot</hi> which maketh one time, he lifteth his <hi>farr fore foot,</hi> and ſetteth it down before his <hi>near fore foot,</hi> which maketh the ſecond time, again juſt as he is ſetting down his: <hi>farr fore foot,</hi> he lifteth his <hi>near hind foot,</hi> and ſetteth it down again ſhort of his <hi>near fore foot,</hi> which maketh the third time, and juſt as he is ſetting it down, he lifteth his <hi>near fore foot,</hi> and ſetteth it down before his <hi>farr fore foot,</hi> which maketh the fourth and laſt time.

                        <p>Now although the Action of a Horſes Leggs in a <hi>VValk,</hi> be two Leggs of a ſide one after the other, yet the <hi>VValk</hi> is the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> which formeth a <hi>St. Andrews Croſs,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Amble,</hi> Which as I ſaid is two Leggs of a ſide removed both together, and the ſides changed ſucceſſively; becauſe as ſtaying a horſe well upon the hand, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him gently forwards with the <hi>Brans</hi> of your Leggs upon a <hi>VValk,</hi> maketh him ſooner ſet down the <hi>fore foot</hi> of that ſide wherewith he leadeth, ſo that it is as ſoon ſet down as the <hi>hind foot</hi> of the ſame ſide, and which <hi>Action</hi> from the <hi>Walk</hi> frameth the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Amble;</hi> So the flacking of your <hi>Bridle hand</hi> in a <hi>Walk,</hi> and preſſing him forwards, forceth him to advance the <hi>hind legg</hi> of the contrary ſide wherewith he began to lead, ſooner then otherwayes he would, and ſo to move at the very ſame time with the <hi>fore legg</hi> of that ſide wherewith he began to lead, which is the true <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> becauſe he is thereby compelled to move his Leggs croſs, that is <hi>fore legg</hi> of one ſide, and <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the other at one and the ſame time, and ſo ſucceſſively each Remove, ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence you ſee there is, between ſtaying a Horſe upon the Hand and preſſing him on, and ſlacking the <hi>Bridle hand</hi> or giving him head, and preſſing him likewayes forwards,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179659:180"/>for although both theſe <hi>motions</hi> of the Hands and Brans, work upon one and the ſame foundation, which is the <hi>Walk,</hi> yet that <hi>Walk</hi> according as thoſe motions of the Hand and Brans are applyed, produceth <hi>Actions</hi> in the Horſes leggs ſo very different, as are theſe of the <hi>Trot</hi> and <hi>Amble,</hi> which no Man would ever dream of, or imagine, did he not clearly ſee that it is ſo, and this much of the <hi>Trot,</hi> of which I have ſaid as well as of the <hi>Walk,</hi> ſomewhat more extraordinary, then you will find in any Book as yet extant, the Obſervations being my own, and I dare affirm altogether new.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>However it is certain, that though a horſe <hi>gallop</hi> right, and with his Leggs <hi>united,</hi> which is his <hi>hinder legg</hi> to follow the <hi>fore legg</hi> wherewith he leadeth, yet if he be not accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead with that ſide, he will <hi>gallop</hi> neither ſo nimbly nor ſo faſt, as if he led with that ſide wherewith he is moſt accuſtomed, for it is juſt in this caſe with a horſe, as it is in ordinary excrciſes with a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Left</hi> handed man, cuſtom very much prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both over Man and beaſt, alſo when a horſe <hi>gallopeth</hi> ſtraight forwards never ſo ſlow a <hi>gallop,</hi> the <hi>Prints</hi> of his <hi>binder feet</hi> exceed alwayes thoſe of his <hi>fore,</hi> and even of that <hi>fore foot</hi> wherewith he leadeth, but <hi>galloping</hi> upon a <hi>Circle</hi> he ſtricks over but ſometimes, and not ſo much neither.</p>
                        <p>Now to underſtand what is meant by a horſes <hi>fore legg</hi> leading, and his <hi>bind legg</hi> of the ſame ſide following, it is thus, if the <hi>farr fore legg</hi> lead, by that <hi>fore legg</hi> leading is meant that it ſhould be alwayes before the other <hi>fore legg,</hi> and the <hi>bind legg</hi> of the ſame ſide to follow it, which <hi>hind legg</hi> muſt alſo alwayes be before the other <hi>hind legg,</hi> and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat to you that this is the true <hi>motion</hi> of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> you may at any time obſerve that a Horſe in <hi>galloping</hi> lifteth both his <hi>fore leggs</hi> at once, that <hi>fore legg</hi> wherewith he leadeth being alwayes moſt advanced, and as his <hi>fore leggs</hi> are falling, I ſay before they touch the Ground, his <hi>hind leggs</hi> follow both together in that ſame very poſture which the <hi>fore leggs</hi> did, that is the one before the other, ſo that all four are in the <hi>Air</hi> at one time, which maketh the <hi>gallop</hi> to be a Leap forwards, for how is it poſſible elſe, that a horſe in <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (which is but a ſwift <hi>gallop</hi>) ſhould ſpring near twice his own length forwards.</p>
                        <p>But although the <hi>gallop</hi> be a <hi>Leap</hi> forwards, and that alſo a horſe lifteth two Leggs at a time; To wit, Firſt his two <hi>fore leggs</hi> and then his two <hi>hind,</hi> yet that doth not hinder him in ſetting down his feet, to mark one, two, three, and four with them, for <hi>galloping</hi> upon a <hi>Circle</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> out, if he lead with the inward <hi>fore legg,</hi> as he alwayes ſhould, and that the <hi>hind legg</hi> of the ſame ſide follow, then thoſe Leggs within the <hi>turn</hi> which lead are preſſed, and theſe without it are at Liberty, which is the reaſon that in the <hi>Action</hi> he maketh, his outward <hi>fore legg</hi> is ſet to the Ground firſt and is at Liberty, which is one time, then his inward <hi>fore legg</hi> which leads and is preſt, is ſet down and maketh a ſecond, which is two, next his outward <hi>hind legg</hi> which is at Liberty is ſet down and maketh three, and laſt of all his inward <hi>hind legg,</hi> which is one of the Leaders upon the inſide and is preſt, maketh the fourth time, ſo that the juſt <hi>Action</hi> and time of a <hi>gallop</hi> is, one, two, three, four, and a <hi>Leap</hi> forwards, now this deſcription of a <hi>Gallop</hi> is moſt true, both as to the <hi>Motion</hi> and poſture of a horſes Leggs, it is true that in a ſoft and ſlow <hi>Gallop</hi> it is hard to be perceived, but in <hi>Running</hi> where the <hi>Motion</hi> is more violent, it is ſo percep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But I muſt now make you underſtand ſome other things which occur in a <hi>Gallop,</hi> whereof many people talke, but none explain what they are; A Horſe then in <hi>Galloping</hi> upon a <hi>Circle</hi> may <hi>Gallop wrong</hi> two wayes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> if in going to the Right hand he <hi>lead</hi> with his <hi>Left fore Legg,</hi> or that which is without the <hi>Turn,</hi> even although the <hi>hind Foot</hi> of the ſame ſide follow it; That is the firſt way, and when a Horſe doth it, he is ſaid to <hi>Gallop falſe,</hi> becauſe he ſhould alwayes lead with his <hi>Fore Legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn.</hi> The ſecond is, that although he lead with his <hi>Fore Legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> which is right, yet if his <hi>Hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide do not follow it, but that his <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the oppoſite ſide, or without the <hi>Turn</hi> follow it, which is the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot;</hi> he will alſo <hi>Gallop wrong,</hi> and when he <hi>Gallops</hi> after this faſſion, which is his <hi>wrong hind Legg</hi> following the <hi>fore Legg</hi> which led, then his Leggs are ſaid to be <hi>diſunited,</hi> therefore you muſt make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between theſe two wayes of <hi>Galloping wrong,</hi> and remember that when a Horſe <hi>Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> with his wrong <hi>Fore Legg,</hi> or that which is without the <hi>Turn,</hi> he is alwiſe ſaid to <hi>Gallop falſe,</hi> but when he leadeth with the right <hi>fore Legg,</hi> or that within the <hi>Turn;</hi> and that the <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide doth not follow, but that of the opoſite ſide or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Turn,</hi> which is the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> then his leggs are ſaid to be only <hi>diſunited,</hi> becauſe for his Leggs to be <hi>united</hi> in a <hi>Gallop,</hi> the <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide in which his <hi>fore Legg led,</hi> ſhould ſtill follow; So that when a Horſes <hi>fore Leggs</hi> in <hi>Galloping</hi> go wrong, he is ſaid to <hi>Gallop falſe:</hi> But when his <hi>hind Leggs</hi> go wrong, and do not follow his <hi>fore</hi> as they ſhould, then he is ſaid to be <hi>diſunited,</hi> and this is the only diſtinction which Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men make between theſe two wayes of <hi>Galloping wrong.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the inconveniency which ariſes, from a Horſes leading with his <hi>wrong fore Legg</hi> upon a <hi>Circle,</hi> and his <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the oppoſite ſide following it, is that it maketh him to be upon the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> which is two Leggs croſs in the <hi>Air</hi> at one time, and his other two Leggs croſs upon the <hi>Ground</hi> at the ſame time, which in a <hi>Gallop</hi> is ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Action,</hi> and ſo contrary to the true <hi>Motion</hi> of it, that if the Rider ſhould but preſs him a little hard, he would be in danger of falling, ſo contrary to <hi>Nature</hi> is this <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Trot</hi> upon the ſwiftneſs of a <hi>Gallop;</hi> therefore for the ſecurity of the Rider, it were farr better that the Horſe in <hi>Leading</hi> with his <hi>Fore Legg</hi> without the <hi>Turn,</hi> made alſo his <hi>hind Legg</hi> upon the ſame ſide follow it, for then although he alſo would <hi>Gallop falſe,</hi> yet he would not be upon the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> which is Croſs; and conſequently not in ſuch danger of falling, now the ſame thing is to be underſtood to whatever hand he is going upon <hi>Circles,</hi> but <hi>Galloping</hi> ſtraight forewards, he can never <hi>Lead</hi> with the wrong <hi>fore Legg,</hi> if the <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide immediatly follow it, and therefore can never be ſaid to <hi>Gallop falſe,</hi> but if his <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide wherewith he <hi>led,</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly follow his <hi>fore,</hi> when he is <hi>Galloping</hi> ſtraight out, then his Leggs will be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united,</hi> but it is impoſſible he can be <hi>falſe,</hi> for the Reaſon above ſpecified. I adviſe you to underſtand theſe two wayes of <hi>Galloping falſe</hi> and <hi>diſunited,</hi> and to fix them well in your <hi>memory,</hi> for I aſſure you the knowing of them is of great conſequence in Mannaging of Horſes.</p>
                        <p>Another way is this, that when a Horſe is upon the <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> where he ſhould alwayes keep two Leggs of a ſide forewards; He changes ſides every time, <hi>fore legg</hi> and <hi>hind Legg</hi> of a ſide, which is two Leggs of one ſide in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and two leggs of the other upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> which is the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Amble</hi> upon the <hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> and Differeth ſo much from the <hi>Motion</hi> of a true <hi>Gallop,</hi> that it maketh the Horſe ready to fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now theſe two, the <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Trot</hi> upon the <hi>Gallop,</hi> which is when a Horſe is <hi>Diſunited,</hi> and the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Amble,</hi> which is two Leggs of a ſide, and the ſides chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each time, is what ſome ignorant people call the <hi>wrong legg before,</hi> but I think I have ſufficiently made you underſtand how to diſtinguiſh them, and therefore ſhall cloſe this Chapter with another <hi>Obſervation</hi> which is this</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Pas</hi> or <hi>Walk</hi> as I have made already appear, is the <hi>Foundation</hi> not only of the <hi>Amble</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Trot;</hi> ſo is the <hi>Trot</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Gallop,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> is this, the <hi>Trot</hi> being two Leggs in the <hi>Air,</hi> and two upon the <hi>Ground</hi> at the ſame time in form of a St. <hi>Andrews Croſs,</hi> and the <hi>Gallop</hi> two Leggs before, or two behind in the <hi>Ayre</hi> at the ſame time; If you <hi>Trot</hi> your Horſe a little quick, and beyond the ſwiftneſs of a <hi>Trot,</hi> you force him (when his <hi>fore legg</hi> wherewith he did not <hi>lead</hi> is in the <hi>Ayre</hi>) to ſet down ſo quickly his <hi>hind Legg</hi> upon the oppoſite ſide, which is that ſide wherewith he did <hi>lead,</hi> that it cauſeth him lift at the very time the <hi>fore Legg</hi> of the ſameſide, ſo that both his <hi>fore Leggs</hi> are in the <hi>Air</hi> at one time, and the <hi>fore Legg</hi> which was laſt a lifting exactly followed with the <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide, which alſo is acompanied with the <hi>hind Legg</hi> of the opoſite ſide, So that both his <hi>fore Leggs</hi> are raiſed and in the <hi>Ayre</hi> together, the

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A <hi>Pace</hi> or <hi>Step,</hi> and a <hi>Leap,</hi> is as it were three <hi>Ayres,</hi> the <hi>Pace</hi> or <hi>Step Terra a Terra,</hi> the raiſing a <hi>Corvet,</hi> and then the <hi>Leap</hi> which finiſheth it; Horſes commonly take themſelves to this <hi>Ayre</hi> of a <hi>Pace</hi> and a <hi>Leap,</hi> when they have not a good <hi>Apuy,</hi> for the <hi>Pace</hi> putteth them upon the Hand, and giveth them a <hi>Riſe</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> to <hi>Leap,</hi> like to a Man who <hi>Runs</hi> before he <hi>Leaps,</hi> and therefore it aſſiſteth a Horſe ſometimes to <hi>Leap</hi> higher, then if he <hi>Leapt</hi> every time: Now no Horſe can be forced to go any of theſe <hi>Ayres</hi> well, unleſs <hi>Nature</hi> hath diſpoſed him for them, it is true by <hi>Art</hi> a Horſe may be ſomewhat conſtrained to them, but then they are never performed with that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> as when <hi>Nature</hi> is only aſſiſted by <hi>Art</hi> and not compelled, which ſhe ſhould rarely be in any thing relating to the Mannage, it being as I have already ſhown you, a received Maxime amongſt Horſemen, that <hi>Art</hi> is deſigned to aſſiſt and perfect <hi>Nature,</hi> but not to <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Oppoſe</hi> her.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have ſhown you all the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial Motions</hi> which a Horſe can make, as alſo how they depend each upon other; But to fix it yet the better in your <hi>Memory,</hi> I ſhall make a ſhort <hi>Recapitulation,</hi> of what I have ſaid of each of them being the <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the other, becauſe it is of very great <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> in <hi>Horſemanſhip,</hi> and therefore you would remember that the <hi>Pas</hi> Or <hi>Walk,</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of both the <hi>Amble</hi> and <hi>Trot,</hi> for if you would have your Horſe <hi>Amble</hi> from a <hi>Walk,</hi> you muſt ſtay him well upon the Hand, and <hi>preſs</hi> and <hi>work</hi> him forwards with the <hi>Brant</hi> of your <hi>Leggs,</hi> one after the other; But if you would have him <hi>Trot</hi> from a <hi>Walk,</hi> then you muſt ſlack your <hi>Bridle hand,</hi> and preſs him on with both your <hi>Brans</hi> at one and the ſame time, which will compel him immediatly to take the <hi>Trot,</hi> ſo you ſee that according as you either <hi>Stay</hi> your Horſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the hand, or give him <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Aids</hi> of your <hi>Brans</hi> being dewly applyed, the <hi>Walk</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of either <hi>Amble</hi> or <hi>Trot:</hi> again the <hi>Trot</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Gallop,</hi> the <hi>Gallop</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Terra a Terra, Terra a Terra</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Demy-Ayre,</hi> or <hi>Demy Volt,</hi> the <hi>Demy-Volt,</hi> (or <hi>Terra a Terra Relevè,</hi> or <hi>fore parts</hi> of the Horſe well raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which is all one with the <hi>Demy-Volt,</hi>) is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Corvets, Corvets</hi> are the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Leaps,</hi> as <hi>Caprioles, Crupades, Balotades,</hi> or whatever other kind they can be of, ſo that I will make bold to ſay that no Man can ſucceed in dreſſing a Horſe, unleſs he make him go <hi>Gradually</hi> and in order, from the one of theſe to the other, which is from <hi>Walk</hi> to <hi>Trot,</hi> from <hi>Trot</hi> to <hi>Gallop,</hi> from <hi>Gallop</hi> to <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> from <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> to <hi>Corvets,</hi> from <hi>Corvets</hi> to all kind of <hi>Leaps,</hi> however all Horſemen are not of this <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet a little <hi>Practice</hi> will in my <hi>Opinion</hi> convince any thinking Horſeman, that this is the only true and regular <hi>Method</hi> which I propoſe, any other way of proceedure being but confuſed, and without any true <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Method</hi> whatſoever, let this therefore ſuffice at preſent, for a ſufficient <hi>Deſcription</hi> of all the <hi>Artificial Motions</hi> which a Horſe can make, the <hi>Natural Paces</hi> being already deſcrived in the preceeding Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial Motions</hi> which a Horſe can make, I think it is now full time to teach you, how you are to work at firſt Colts or young Horſes, upon <hi>Large Circles</hi> of one <hi>Piſte</hi> or <hi>Tread,</hi> but before I begin, I will firſt ſhow you how to order and fix your <hi>Cavezon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take therefore one of the <hi>Reins</hi> of your <hi>Cavezon,</hi> (which is alſo to have a <hi>Headſtal</hi> and <hi>Chaulband,</hi>) and which muſt be of a good length and having a Ring at one end of it, thorrow which put the other end of the <hi>Rein,</hi> drawing it ſtill thorrow the Ring until you form a <hi>nooſe</hi> or <hi>Loop,</hi> at that end of the <hi>Rein</hi> next to the Ring, which <hi>Loop</hi> put over the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> making the reſt of the <hi>Rein</hi> to come down between your <hi>Thigh</hi> and the <hi>fore bolder</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> and then put the reſt of the <hi>Rein</hi> thorow the Ring of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezon</hi> upon that ſame ſide, and bring the end of it back again towards you, either to hold in your hand (which I would alwiſe adviſe you to do, ſo long as you are <hi>Suppling</hi> of a Horſes <hi>Shoulders.</hi>) or to faſten with a <hi>Buckle</hi> to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle</hi> there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main fixt, ſo long as you intend to Ride him to that hand upon which the <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezon</hi> is made faſt, and when you have done with Riding him to that hand, do the ſame with the <hi>Rein</hi> upon the other ſide, in every particular as I have ordered you in this.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Cavezon</hi> being this ordered, and you upon Horſeback, and the <hi>Reins</hi> of the <hi>Briddle</hi> in your <hi>left hand,</hi> if you go to the <hi>Right,</hi> pull with your <hi>Right Hand</hi> the <hi>inward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> low, and towards your <hi>Knee</hi> within the <hi>Volt</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> helping him alſo with your Legg within the <hi>Turn,</hi> to bring in his <hi>Outward Shoulder,</hi> which is <hi>Rein</hi> and <hi>Legg of a ſide,</hi> and this is to be done firſt upon a <hi>Step,</hi> the <hi>Bridle hand</hi> ſome what low, and a little upon the <hi>inſide</hi> of the Horſes <hi>Neck,</hi> but from time to time you muſt carry it upon the <hi>out ſide,</hi> and then immediatly bring it again to its place, which is a little upon the <hi>inſide,</hi> afterwards again place it upon the <hi>outſide</hi> as you ſhall find Occaſion for it, now this pulling of the <hi>inward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> and helping alſo with the <hi>inward legg</hi> or <hi>Spurr,</hi> giveth a Horſe a good <hi>Plye,</hi> and although the <hi>Principal Aid</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> ſhould be alwayes with the <hi>outward Rein,</hi> which is to carry the Hand a little upon the <hi>inſide</hi> of his <hi>Neck,</hi> yet the <hi>inward Rein</hi> is alſo made uſe of, (which is to carry the <hi>Bridle hand</hi> upon the outſide of his <hi>Neck</hi>) to enlarge the <hi>Circle,</hi> and prevent a Horſes <hi>Straitning</hi> or <hi>Cloſing</hi> it too much: It alſo giveth him an <hi>Apuy,</hi> by making him endure the <hi>Bitt,</hi> for this mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it both work upon his <hi>Barrs</hi> and place of the <hi>Curb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you continue a little upon a <hi>Step</hi> this <hi>Leſſon,</hi> of <hi>Rein</hi> and <hi>Legg</hi> upon a ſide, you will find your Horſe grow eaſie upon it, which will prepare him for a good <hi>Trot</hi> and to <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop large</hi> upon <hi>Circles</hi> of one <hi>Piſte,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> alwayes out, which will ſupple his <hi>Shoulders</hi> extreamly, eſpecially that without the <hi>Turn,</hi> ſo that it may paſs for the beſt of all <hi>Leſſons,</hi> the <hi>Suppling</hi> of the <hi>Shoulders</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of a Horſe being the <hi>Source</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of a good Mannage, and that which all good Horſemen ſhould at firſt chiefly aim at.</p>
                     <p>However, the working thus with <hi>Rein</hi> and <hi>Legg</hi> of a ſide the Horſes <hi>Croup</hi> out, doth at firſt put a Horſe very much upon his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and maketh him alſo preſs a little too hard upon the <hi>Bitt,</hi> but in five or ſix dayes riding he will be no more upon his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> but upon the contrary, he will begin to plye his <hi>Haunches,</hi> and endure to be keept upon them, if you ſupport him a little with the <hi>Bridle,</hi> and ſtay him upon the hand now and then, and immediatly ſlack it again, <hi>I tell you this but only by the bye,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief deſign of this <hi>Leſſon</hi> is, for <hi>Suppling</hi> the <hi>Shoulders</hi> of a Horſe, and not to put him upon his <hi>Haunches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo know that in performing this <hi>Leſſon,</hi> if you do not bring in the Horſes <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shoulder</hi> with it, you do nothing, and therefore to bring it in, you muſt cauſe the <hi>Inward Shoulder</hi> to come back within the <hi>Turn,</hi> as it were towards you, that ſo it may be preſſed and carry the whole weight of the <hi>fore parts</hi> of the Horſe, while at the ſame time the <hi>Outward Shoulder</hi> is at Liberty, that it may <hi>Supple,</hi> ſo that although you are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and then to carrie your <hi>Bridle hand</hi> without his <hi>Neek,</hi> yet you muſt immediatly replace it again within, and work with the <hi>Outward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> that you may bring in his <hi>Outward Shoulder,</hi> for if a Horſes <hi>Shoulders</hi> be not made extraordinary eaſie and ſupple, it will not only be a means to cauſe him reſiſt and defend himſelf againſt you, but it will alſo make him uncapable to perform any thing in the Mannage as he ought, many of the <hi>Diſorders</hi> which are ſeen in Mannages, proceeding from the Horſes not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Suppled</hi> in the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and there is nothing in the World which doth more <hi>Supple</hi> them, then this <hi>Leſſon</hi> with the <hi>Cavezon Rein</hi> and <hi>Legg</hi> of a ſide, nor which doth fix and place their Heads better.</p>
                     <p>Now if you perform this <hi>Leſſon</hi> exactly, the Horſes <hi>bind leggs</hi> will make two <hi>Circles</hi> conſiderably lager than thoſe made by his <hi>Fore,</hi> and although his <hi>Croup</hi> be very much out, and that he inclineth and leaneth ſo very much upon his <hi>Inſide,</hi> as may make you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179659:182"/>that he will fall, yet it is ſo much the better, and he goeth alſo ſo much the more ſecure, therefore give him no other <hi>Leſſon</hi> but this upon the <hi>Trot</hi> and <hi>Gallop,</hi> either in <hi>large</hi> or <hi>narrow Circles,</hi> until his <hi>Shoulders</hi> be extreamly well <hi>Suppled,</hi> and that you find him <hi>Gallop light,</hi> for it is not enough that a Horſe be made <hi>Supple,</hi> he muſt alſo be made eaſie and light, which can be done by no other <hi>Method</hi> but this, which is the very <hi>Baſis</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Mannage; However, do not at firſt begin to <hi>Gallop</hi> him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you find him ſo <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Readie,</hi> that he offer to take the <hi>Gallop</hi> of his own accord when he is <hi>Troting</hi> after this <hi>Faſhion,</hi> that is <hi>Cavezon Rein</hi> and <hi>Legg of a ſide,</hi> or his <hi>Head</hi> in and <hi>Croup</hi> out, and uſing this <hi>Method</hi> you will firſt <hi>Supple</hi> him upon a <hi>Walk</hi> or <hi>Step,</hi> next upon a <hi>Trot,</hi> and then upon a <hi>Gallop,</hi> which was what you intended: See <hi>Plate</hi> Fourth, <hi>Fig.</hi> ſixth, but in that Figure the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>Rein</hi> is pulled <hi>high</hi> and <hi>eroſs</hi> the <hi>horſes neck</hi> as it were, and not <hi>low</hi> towards the <hi>knee,</hi> and therefore is more proper for a <hi>ſhort Trot</hi> then <hi>ſuppling</hi> of the <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> although it be very good for both. Now what I have ſaid of <hi>Going to the Right Hand,</hi> may be eaſily applyed to the <hi>Going upon the Left,</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being only this, that you muſt hold your <hi>Bridle</hi> with your <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and pull the <hi>Cavezons Inward Rein</hi> with the <hi>Left.</hi>

                        </gap>om which exactly, you muſt pull hard as I ſaid the inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> and make your <hi>outward Legg</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching it near his ſide, bring in your Horſes <hi>outward bind Legg,</hi> otherwayes he cannot <hi>Stop</hi> upon his <hi>Haunebes,</hi> becauſe his <hi>outward Haunch</hi> would be without the <hi>Volt,</hi> alſo you would take care not to make him <hi>advance</hi> or riſe before, when you are firſt teaching him to <hi>Stop,</hi> for this hath ſpoiled many a Horſe, making them at the leaſt pull you give them to riſe ſo high before, that they are in danger of <hi>Renverſing,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over upon their Rider, therefore never teach your Horſe to <hi>advance</hi> or raiſe before, after you <hi>Stop</hi> him, untill he obey your <hi>hand and beel</hi> pretty well, and be alſo well ſettled upon the <hi>hand;</hi> in ſhort the raiſing of a Horſe before or upon <hi>Peſates,</hi> ſhould be one of the laſt things a Man ſhould teach his Horſe, unleſs he intend to ſpoil him, this much of <hi>Stoping.</hi> See <hi>Plate</hi> Fourth, <hi>Fig.</hi> ſeventh.</p>
                     <p>Now when you would have your Horſe <hi>go back,</hi> if it beupon a ſtraight line, then lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back a little with your Body, and ſlacking your <hi>Thighs,</hi> pull equally both the <hi>Reins</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> one being in each hand, very ſtrongly, to ſee if you can force him back but one ſingle ſtep or two at firſt, for if you can bring him to perform that, he will in a ſhort time do more, but if he altogether oppoſe you by fixing his <hi>fore Leggs</hi> upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> and remaining immoveable as a Rock, then pull hard the <hi>Reins</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> one after the other, as if you were ſawing of wood, and this perhaps will make him yeeld to you; But if notwithſtanding of this he ſtill reſiſt you, then it is a ſigne his <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are not as yet Supple enough for it, therefore continue to ſupple them yet better, and then he will certainly comply with you.</p>
                     <p>This you are to do when you intend to make your Horſe go back in a ſtraight line, which is the moſt uſeful, but if you are to make him <hi>go back</hi> upon a <hi>Round</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> then make uſe of the <hi>inward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> and <hi>outward Leg,</hi> juſt as you was ordered to do upon a <hi>ſtop,</hi> and after this faſſion make him <hi>go back</hi> in a <hi>Round,</hi> which will help alſo extreamly to put him upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> and although I adviſe you to make but gentle <hi>Stops</hi> at the beginning, as alſo to have him anſwer the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heels,</hi> and pretty well ſettled upon the <hi>hand,</hi> before you offer to raiſe him before; Yet I do not ſay this of

                     </p>
                     <p>Another excellent <hi>Leſſon</hi> for <hi>ſuppling</hi> a Horſes <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and to make him attentive to the will of the Rider, is this, <hi>Trot</hi> him, and without <hi>ſtoping</hi> him upon his <hi>Trot,</hi> make him go Gently from it to a ſhort and ſlow <hi>Gallop,</hi> and from the <hi>Gallop</hi> to his <hi>Trot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and though he go ſtill upon the ſame <hi>hand,</hi> yet change him from <hi>Trot</hi> to <hi>Gallop,</hi> and from <hi>Gallop</hi> to <hi>Trot,</hi> untill you think it ſufficient, and then make him <hi>ſtop</hi> either u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his <hi>Trot</hi> or <hi>Gallop</hi> as you ſhall think fit, this is a moſt excellent <hi>Leſſon</hi> not only to <hi>ſupple</hi> his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> but to make him attend and obey the will of his Rider: For having no continued Rule to fix his mind on, and to make him go by <hi>Rote</hi> either in <hi>Trotting</hi> or <hi>Galloping,</hi> he muſt abſolutely obey both the <hi>hand</hi> and the <hi>heels,</hi> for not knowing when or where he will be <hi>ſtopt,</hi> will make him ſtill to be expecting it, and alwayes attentive to the <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heels</hi> of the Rider, ſo that he will be alwayes ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, and therefore there can hardly be a better <hi>Leſſon</hi> for <hi>ſuppling</hi> a Horſes <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and preventing his <hi>going by Rote</hi> then this, for all our deſigne in Horſemanſhip, is to make a Horſe anſwer and obey the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heels,</hi> and this <hi>Leſſon</hi> bringeth a Horſe a great length in both, therefore I adviſe you to eſteem it.

                     <p>If your Horſe <hi>Retain</hi> his force or Mettle, then <hi>Gallop</hi> him <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>quick,</hi> afterwards <hi>ſoftly,</hi> and then <hi>faſt again</hi> as need requireth, and this <hi>ſoftly</hi> and <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>ſoftle</hi> upon his <hi>Gallop</hi> (not knowing when he muſt do either) will be a great means to make him obey both his Riders <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>beels,</hi> which is the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of the Mannage.</p>
                     <p>But after you have <hi>Suppled</hi> your Horſes <hi>Shoulders</hi> ſufficiently, and that you find him hard on the <hi>Hand</hi> by not being upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> then <hi>Trot</hi> him upon <hi>large Circles</hi> of one <hi>Piſte</hi> or <hi>Tread,</hi> and <hi>Stop</hi> him often with pretty <hi>hard Stops,</hi> helping him alwayes with your <hi>outward Legg</hi> to bring in his <hi>outward Haunch,</hi> and your <hi>Shoulders</hi> and Body a little back, and ſtop him thus when he leaſt thinks of it; But if he incline to <hi>Stop</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then Preſs him forewards without <hi>Stoping</hi> of him, and then upon a ſudden <hi>Stop</hi> him again when he is not expecting it: Repeat this <hi>Leſſon</hi> often, both upon the <hi>Trot</hi> and <hi>Gallop,</hi> and you will in a <hi>ſhort time</hi> find him very much upon the <hi>Haunches,</hi> for this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Leſſon</hi> both to ſettle him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> and to put him upon his <hi>Haunches;</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have <hi>gained</hi> this <hi>point,</hi> you muſt then not practiſe this <hi>Leſſon</hi> ſo frequently as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe it <hi>Pinches</hi> a Horſe very much on the back, as alſo maketh him afraid to go frankly forewards, which maybe a means not only to cauſe him <hi>Reſt,</hi> but alſo to produce other inconveniences; Therefore your Judgement muſt work according as you find occaſion, and as I have already told you you muſt accuſtom him, firſt to <hi>Stop</hi> upon a <hi>Walk</hi> and <hi>Trot,</hi> before you adventure to <hi>ſtop</hi> him upon a <hi>Gallop,</hi> otherwayes you will put your Horſe in a fair way of not only <hi>Pinching</hi> his <hi>Reins,</hi> and ſtraining his <hi>back Sinews,</hi> but of utterly diſguſting the Mannage.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe <hi>Leſsons</hi> are only to <hi>ſupple</hi> a Horſes <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> therefore ſee that you make uſe of no other <hi>Leſſons</hi> but theſe, untill you find your Horſe extreamly <hi>ſupple</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> and alſo firm on the <hi>hand,</hi> for they are excellent to ſettle a Horſe upon the <hi>hand,</hi> to <hi>ſupple</hi> his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and make him look into the <hi>Turn,</hi> to <hi>Trot</hi> and <hi>Gallop</hi> right (as he ſhould) both <hi>Leggs, head, Neck, Body</hi> and all, beſides, they prevent a Horſes being <hi>Entier,</hi> called by the <hi>Italians</hi> the <hi>Credenza,</hi> which is an <hi>Averſion</hi> that Horſes have to <hi>Turn,</hi> and is certainly one of the worſt and moſt dangerous <hi>Vices</hi> which a Horſe can have, eſpecially upon any kind of ſervice; uſe therefore alwayes theſe <hi>Leſſons</hi> upon both narrow and large <hi>Cireles,</hi> untill you find your Horſe extreamly <hi>ſupple</hi> in his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> that being the firſt and principal thing a Man ſhould aim at in dreſſing of Horſes, for they as well as Men do nothing but by cuſtom and habite, and the <hi>Help</hi> of good and Methodical <hi>Leſſons</hi> often Repeated, which fixes it in their memories: give then theſe good <hi>Leſſons,</hi> and Repeat them often to you Horſe, and you will find by them benefite and contentment; And remember I tell you, that in making uſe of them, you work more upon his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then upon the labour you give his Body, for I aſſure you a Horſe hath imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Memorie, and Judgement, let the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and Learned ſay what they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>I muſt likewayes tell you, that to <hi>unite</hi> a Horſes ſtrength and Mettle, to aſſure and ſettle his <hi>head</hi> and <hi>Haunehes,</hi> and to make him <hi>light</hi> on the <hi>hand,</hi> and juſt and firm in all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179659:183"/>ſorts of Mannages, dependeth abſolutely upon the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>ſtop,</hi> but firſt he muſt be <hi>Leoſened</hi> and well <hi>ſuppled</hi> upon the <hi>ſtep</hi> and <hi>Trot,</hi> therefore never <hi>Gallop</hi> your Horſe untill you find him ſo <hi>Light</hi> upon his <hi>Trot,</hi> that he offers to <hi>Gallop</hi> of himſelf, for the exerciſe of the <hi>Trot</hi> is the firſt and moſt neceſſary foundation to make him <hi>Light,</hi> and the Ground of every <hi>Leſſon</hi> which can make a Horſe <hi>Adroit,</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> in any kind of Mannage. Again the property of the <hi>Gallop</hi> is to give him a good <hi>Apuy,</hi> and to ſettle his head, alſo if he have too much <hi>fire,</hi> a ſhort or ſlow <hi>Gallop</hi> will appaiſe him, and give him patience, or if he <hi>Play</hi> too much upon the <hi>Back</hi> beneath a Man, it will take it off, but all this muſt be performed upon large <hi>Circles,</hi> of at leaſt twentyfour or Thirty foot <hi>Diamiter,</hi> and ſo it will calm his Spirits, make him well winded, and take away his too violent apprehenſions, alſo divert him from evil deſignes, or <hi>Jadiſh</hi> tricks, from <hi>Reſtineſs,</hi> or having a <hi>Double Heart,</hi> for it will <hi>Supple</hi> his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and make him attentive to the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heels</hi> of his Rider; and conſequently, prevent and remedy all the abovementioned <hi>Vices.</hi>

                     <p>So here is the end of the <hi>Leſſons</hi> for working and <hi>Suppling</hi> a Horſes <hi>Shoulders,</hi> the which if you can make him perfom exactly, I aſſure you the better half of the work is done, for dreſſing and making him a perfect Horſe; the next <hi>Leſſons</hi> I ſhall give you are the other half, and eaſieſt of the two, which is to make your Horſe ſenſible and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to your <hi>Heels;</hi> and therefore I ſhall begin with one which will work both his <hi>ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Croup</hi> at one and the ſame time.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To work therefore a Horſes <hi>Croup</hi> and <hi>Shoulders</hi> together, you muſt make uſe of the inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> and outward Legg; pull then the inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezon</hi> with your hand, to bring in his outward Shoulder and preſs him upon the inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> that his Leggs without the <hi>Turn</hi> may be free, and at Liberty to lap over his <hi>inward Leggs,</hi> which is called by Horſemen, <hi>Paſſager</hi> or <hi>Chevaler,</hi> the <hi>Croup</hi> in; Now although in this <hi>Paſſaging</hi> the Horſes Leggs be upon the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Trot,</hi> yet it is leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent then a <hi>Trot,</hi> and more then a <hi>Walk,</hi> ſo conſequently one of the beſt Leſſons can be for making a horſe <hi>attentive</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> to the <hi>Heels</hi> of his <hi>Rider,</hi> and as it were to keep him equally <hi>ballanced</hi> between the two <hi>Spurrs,</hi> that ſo he may anſwer either the one or the other, as Occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Leſſon therefore that you ſhall give him upon this <hi>Action,</hi> muſt be with his <hi>head to a Wall</hi> or <hi>Paliſade,</hi> pulling the inward <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> to whatever hand you are going hard to you, and helping at the ſame time with your <hi>outward Legg,</hi> to make the Horſe go ſidewayes, and with the half of his Shoulders alwayes before his <hi>Croup,</hi> which will make him narrow and preſſed behind and ſo upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> becauſe he is upon the <hi>Action</hi> of a <hi>Trot;</hi> if he do not obey your <hi>Heel</hi> give him the <hi>Spurr</hi> gently upon that ſide, and continue this Leſſon until you find him obedient to your <hi>heels,</hi> now when a horſe is thus <hi>Paſſaging</hi> his Leggs within the <hi>Turn</hi> are preſſed, and theſe without are at Liberty, otherwayes they could not at every other time, with eaſe <hi>lap</hi> or <hi>croſs</hi> over theſe within, you may alſo with the ſame <hi>helps</hi> give your horſe this Leſſon in the Open fields, where you have neither <hi>Wall, Paliſade,</hi> nor any thing elſe to confine him.

                     <p>When your horſe obeys <hi>perfectly</hi> your <hi>Heel,</hi> upon the <hi>Paſſage along a Wall,</hi> then work him with the ſame Leſſon upon Large <hi>Circles,</hi> pulling as I ſaid the <hi>Cavezons</hi> inward <hi>Rein</hi> hard to you, to bring in his outward Shoulder, bending his <hi>Neek</hi> extreamly and helping with your <hi>outward Legg,</hi> which is <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Rein</hi> of <hi>contrary ſides,</hi> taking alwayes care that the half of his <hi>Shoulders</hi> go before his <hi>Croup,</hi> and if he do not anſwer your <hi>Heel</hi> then give him the <hi>Spurr</hi> with your <hi>Outward legg,</hi> alſo whatever hand you teach him to <hi>Paſſage</hi> upon firſt, make him do as much to the other, which is but changing <hi>Bridle hand, Cavezon Rein,</hi> and <hi>Legg,</hi> and when you find him obedient in <hi>paſſaging</hi> upon <hi>Large Circles</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> in, which will put him upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> then make him go the <hi>paſsage</hi> in <hi>little Circles,</hi> whoſe <hi>Diamiter</hi> is little longer then his own length, See Plate fifth, figure firſt. And if he be obedient, and anſwer your <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel</hi> there upon both hands, I aſſure you he is advanced very far towards a <hi>Ready Horſe,</hi> for if a Horſe obey your <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel</hi> upon this <hi>paſſaging,</hi> which is a <hi>Gentle Motion,</hi> and therefore very proper to teach a Horſe, be cauſe it will make him patient, and ſo fortifie his <hi>Memorie</hi> the better, I ſay if he be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to you upon this <hi>Action,</hi> which is the <hi>Quinteſcenee</hi> of dreſſing Horſes, then you may make him do any thing that his Force and Strength will permit him.</p>

                     <p>Now when he riſes perfectly as you would have him upon <hi>Large Circles,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> being at a little liberty, then put his <hi>Croup</hi> in, and ſo raiſe him, feeling him upon your <hi>Hand,</hi> and ſtaying and ſupporting him a little in the <hi>Air,</hi> and this will both put him upon the <hi>hand,</hi> and upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> but as I ſaid, I would not have you adventure to <hi>Riſe</hi> him, until he be advanced to ſuch a length in his Mannage as I have told you; becauſe it would diſorder his mouth, put him off the <hi>Hand,</hi> and make him <hi>Reſty,</hi> for many Horſes riſe <hi>Reſtly,</hi> becauſe they have no great mind either to go forewards or turn, and therefore until they obey the <hi>hand,</hi> fly the <hi>heel,</hi> and ſtop pretty ſhort, there is no Riſing of them, however in teaching him to Riſe I would alwayes have you begin upon <hi>larg

                     <p>Now becauſe it is very matterial for the dreſſing of Horſes, that a Horſeman know the ſeveral and different opperations of the <hi>Cavezons inward Rein,</hi> tyed to the <hi>Girths</hi> or <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> I ſhall not withſtanding of what I have already ſaid of them in diſcourſing of the effects of the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> give you in this place a further diſcovery of their different uſes and operations; And firſt therefore of the <hi>Cavezons inward Rein</hi> tyed to the <hi>Girths,</hi> or even held in ones hand, and pulled low within the <hi>Turn</hi> towards the Riders <hi>Knee,</hi> the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> then being pulled thus low, or tyed to the <hi>Girths,</hi> worketh a Horſes outward <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> preſſes his <hi>Leggs</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and leaves his <hi>Leggs</hi> at liberty without the <hi>Turn,</hi> is excellent in <hi>Troting</hi> or <hi>Galloping</hi> him upon <hi>large</hi> or <hi>narrow Circles</hi> of one <hi>Piſte,</hi> for this <hi>ſupples</hi> his <hi>ſhoulders</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> being a little out, which brings in his outward <hi>ſhoulder</hi> more, it is alſo excellent in <hi>Paſſaging</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> a little in, to make him with the more eaſe lap one legg over another, becauſe by the help of it his <hi>outward ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> is brought in, but if you ſhould preſs his <hi>Croup</hi> to much in, it would be impoſible for him to go, becauſe the <hi>Rein</hi> being tyed to the <hi>Girths,</hi> or pulled low, worketh and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his <hi>outward ſhoulder,</hi> and by putting his <hi>Buttoek</hi> to much in, you put back his <hi>outward ſhoulder,</hi> which is a quite contrary <hi>Action,</hi> and cannot be done at the ſame time, therefore as I ſaid let the half of your Horſes <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> or one <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> alwayes go before his <hi>Haunches,</hi> this <hi>inward Rine</hi> is alſo moſt proper for the <hi>ſhort Gallop,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet there is no doubt, but that though the <hi>Inward Rein</hi> be tyed to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> or pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led croſs the Horſes <hi>Neck,</hi> and be wrought upon the <hi>Trot</hi> and <hi>Gallop</hi> in <hi>large circles,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> out, As in Plate fourth figure ſixth but that it <hi>Suppleth</hi> his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> although not ſo powerfully as when it is tyed to the <hi>Girths,</hi> or pulled low, and the Reaſon is becauſe his <hi>Croup</hi> is out, and it is certain that when a Horſe is wrought with his <hi>Croup</hi> out, what ever way the <hi>Inward Rein</hi> be pulled high or low, his <hi>ſhoulders</hi> are alwayes <hi>ſuppled,</hi> becauſe when his <hi>Croup</hi> is put out, of neceſſity his <hi>outward ſhoulder</hi> muſt come in, and ſo be <hi>ſuppled.</hi>

                     <p>Now after your Horſe can <hi>perform</hi> all his <hi>Leſſons dextrouſly,</hi> the <hi>Cavezons inward Rein</hi> being thus tyed ſhort to the <hi>Pommel</hi> of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> and you <hi>helping him ſtill with your Bridle hand</hi> as he ſhall require it; There is no doubt, but by this time he will be brought a great length, in knowing and underſtanding the different Operations of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> both upon his <hi>Barrs</hi> and place of the <hi>Curb,</hi> and therefore after this time I would adviſe you to lay wholly aſide your <hi>Cavezon,</hi> except for once or twice a Week, that you ſhould alwiſe give him his <hi>Leſſons</hi> with it, and make only uſe of your <hi>Bridle Reins,</hi> either

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then, If your Horſe preſs forewards too much, ſtay him well upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> or pull him back, if he offer to <hi>go back,</hi> preſs him forewards, if he <hi>go ſidewayes</hi> againſt your will to the <hi>Right hand,</hi> put him <hi>ſidewayes</hi> upon the <hi>Left,</hi> and if he will <hi>go ſidewayes</hi> upon the <hi>Left hand,</hi> force him to <hi>go ſidewayes</hi> upon the <hi>Right,</hi> if he put too much out his <hi>Croup,</hi> by throwing it upon your <hi>Outward heel,</hi> then with your <hi>Outward ſpurr</hi> put it in, and if he put it in too much, by throwing it upon your <hi>Inward heel,</hi> then with your <hi>Inward ſpurr</hi> force it out again, if he go too much upon his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> then ſtop him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and make him <hi>go back,</hi> and alſo ſtay him well upon the <hi>hand</hi> as you are <hi>Gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him, but if he go upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> then continue him ſo; if he <hi>advance</hi> or <hi>riſe before,</hi> when you would not have him, then as he is a falling give him the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and keep him down, and do all this firſt upon a <hi>Walk,</hi> then a <hi>Trot,</hi> and laſt of all upon a <hi>ſhort Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,</hi> which will make him attend your <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heel,</hi> and follow your Will, and ſo of neceſſity he muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bey you, becauſe he is thus put from his own will to yours, and ſo it cannot chuſe but make him a perfect Horſe.</p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>Leſſon</hi> comparable to <hi>Paſſaging</hi> the <hi>Croup</hi> in, to make a Horſe obey the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heel,</hi> and to raiſe him now and then upon <hi>Peſſates,</hi> and then <hi>paſſage</hi> him again, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards raiſe him upon <hi>peſſates,</hi> and <hi>paſsage</hi> him again, but as I have already told you, your Horſe muſt be well advanced, before you adventure to make him <hi>riſe before,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes you may come to ſpoil him, if you find he is not well upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> then <hi>Walk</hi> or <hi>Trot</hi> him upon <hi>large Circles,</hi> or rather a <hi>Square,</hi> and ſtop him hard and raiſe him, now all theſe <hi>Leſſons</hi> muſt be done upon the <hi>VValk</hi> or <hi>Trot,</hi> and in <hi>paſsaging;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>are thing <hi>VValking</hi> and <hi>paſſaging</hi> a Horſe is, for to make and dreſs him perfectly.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe do not incline to <hi>riſe</hi> eaſily <hi>before</hi> upon <hi>peſates</hi> when you are upon his <hi>Back;</hi> then put him between the <hi>pillars,</hi> as in Plate fifth figure fourth, helping him with two <hi>Rods</hi> upon the outſides of his <hi>fore things,</hi> and in a ſhourt time he will come to do it, now I do not think that the <hi>pillars</hi> ſerve for any other uſe but this, neither would I ever adviſe you to make uſe of them but in this Caſe, and ſo ſoon as ever you find your Horſe to <hi>riſe eaſily,</hi> then take him quite from them, with a reſolution never to put him betwixt them again, for I aſſure you they conſtrain and ſubject a Horſes <hi>Croup</hi> too much, and alſo make him to go by <hi>Rote,</hi> which is what a Man ſhould ſhun, as much as any one thing in the mannaging of a Horſe, but the Uſe of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> doth abſolutely help this, for with it he cannot go by <hi>Rote,</hi> becauſe with it, neither the <hi>Eyes</hi> nor <hi>Ears</hi> do any thing, but the Horſe meerly obeys the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heels</hi> of his Rider, which maketh all Horſes go perfectly, of what Nature or Condition ſoever they be, and very rarely faileth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Never force or preſs your Horſe too much to any thing, as <hi>Going back, Stoping,</hi> or <hi>Riſing before,</hi> until you find him very <hi>ſupple</hi> in the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and prety ſenſible and obedient both to your <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel,</hi> becauſe young Horſes muſt never be much preſt, nor ſtopt too hard or ſhort at firſt, for if you did, it would give them ſuch a <hi>Crick</hi> or <hi>Taint</hi> in their <hi>Back,</hi> as they would ſcarcely ever recover it, now if you can work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe <hi>Precepts,</hi> and apply all theſe <hi>Excellent Leſſons</hi> to your Horſe ſeaſonably and in time, and that you know where his fault lyeth, whither in his <hi>Shoulders</hi> or <hi>Croup,</hi> you will I dare anſwer for it, infallibly make and dreſs all Horſes that ſhall ever come into your hands, which I wiſh you may do, that ſo out of a miſtake you may not blame the <hi>Leſſons</hi> I have given you, (becauſe of your not being capable to put them exactly in Practiſe,) as the Cauſe and Reaſon of your bad Succeſs.</p>

                     <p>Now the horſe being thus <hi>couched</hi> upon his <hi>out ſide</hi> by the poſture of your Body, the pulling of the <hi>Inward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> enlarges him <hi>before,</hi> by pulling as it were his <hi>inward fore Legg,</hi> from the <hi>outward fore legg;</hi> Which putteth his <hi>inward hinder legg,</hi> near to his <hi>outward hinder legg,</hi> which narrows him <hi>bebind,</hi> maketh him bow in the <hi>Gambrells,</hi> eſpecially in his <hi>outward hinder legg</hi> whereon he reſteth moſt, and thruſts his <hi>inward hinder legg</hi> under his <hi>belly,</hi> which with all the <hi>Helps</hi> above mentioned, maketh him go very much upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> for thus the Horſe is preſt upon the <hi>Outſide,</hi> and therefore muſt of neceſſity look within the <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Turn,</hi> and his <hi>fore parts</hi> being enlarged, will make him imbrace the <hi>Corners</hi> of the <hi>Square</hi> the better when he is to round them, alſo his <hi>hind leggs</hi> being within the Lines of his <hi>fore leggs,</hi> he muſt needs be upon the <hi>Haunches,</hi> and his <hi>inward fore legg</hi> being in a manner pulled from his <hi>outward fore legg,</hi> his <hi>inward fore legg</hi> with which he leadeth, will appear to be longer then his <hi>outward fore legg,</hi> and make the firſt and <hi>largeſt circle</hi> or <hi>Square,</hi> which is right, and ſo his <hi>outward fore legg</hi> will make the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and his <hi>inward hind legg</hi> the third, becauſe it is thruſt ſo much before his <hi>Outward hind legg,</hi> and under his <hi>Belly,</hi> and then his <hi>Outward hind legg</hi> will make the fourth and leaſt <hi>square</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> becauſe it is ſo much <hi>plyed</hi> in the <hi>Gambrel</hi> by reſting upon it; And thus a Horſe will make four perfect <hi>Squares</hi> or <hi>Circles,</hi> according as he is wrought upon either of them about a <hi>Pillar,</hi> or <hi>imaginary center</hi> as I have told you, and given the reaſons for it; For you ſee a Horſes <hi>fore parts</hi> go alwayes before his <hi>hind parts,</hi> at leaſt they ſhould do ſo, that is half his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> or one <hi>ſhoulder</hi> within the <hi>Turn</hi> or <hi>Square,</hi> before his <hi>Croup</hi> or <hi>inward haunch,</hi> which is his <hi>fore legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> before his <hi>hind legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and thus a Horſe can never <hi>go falſe,</hi> but moſt exactly true, with <hi>Head, Neck, Body, Leggs,</hi> and all.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Action</hi> of a Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi> in the <hi>Piroyte</hi> is very extraordinar,<note place="margin">CHAP: XXVII.</note> for your <hi>hand</hi> being upon the outſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> to make him look into the <hi>Turn</hi> before you begin the <hi>Piroyte,</hi> you muſt in an inſtant work violently with the <hi>outward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> to ſtraiten his <hi>fore parts,</hi> and give his <hi>hinder parts</hi> more liberty, but you are to give him no <hi>help</hi> at all with any of your <hi>Leggs,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Action</hi> of the Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi> will be thus;</p>
                     <p>As he is going to the <hi>right hand,</hi> at the ſame time that he lifteth his two <hi>fore leggs,</hi> he lifteth his <hi>hind legg</hi> without the <hi>Turn,</hi> ſo that he hath three <hi>Leggs</hi> up at a time, and all the weight of his <hi>Body</hi> at that time reſteth upon his <hi>inward hind legg</hi> only, and when thoſe three <hi>Leggs</hi> that were up come to the ground, his <hi>outward ſhoulder</hi> commeth in ſo quickly, that it maketh his <hi>inward hind legg</hi> to move at the ſame time almoſt in one place, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of a <hi>Center,</hi> that ſo he may make an exact <hi>Turn</hi> or <hi>Circle;</hi> I ſay that at the ſame time, his three <hi>leggs</hi> which were in the <hi>Ayre</hi> are ſet down, his <hi>inward bind legg</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves to accompany the <hi>Round</hi> or <hi>Circle</hi> but in a manner ſtill in one place, ſo that indeed the <hi>inward hind legg</hi> is the <hi>Center,</hi> upon which the Horſe turneth, though at the ſame time it move <hi>round,</hi> and when the Horſe is ſo <hi>Giddie</hi> that he can go no longer for fear of falling, he then thruſts his <hi>inward hind legg</hi> forewards beneath his <hi>Belly</hi> to ſtop himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are exactly the <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of a Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi> in the <hi>Piroyte,</hi> elſe he could not go ſo ſwiftly as he both ought, and as Horſes alwayes do when they are performing that <hi>Action,</hi> and becauſe the Horſe is upon his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and preſt upon the inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> therefore is it that the only <hi>help</hi> is with the <hi>outward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> to bring quickly in his <hi>outward ſhoulder,</hi> and give his <hi>Croup</hi> a little liberty, and that without any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179659:189"/>aſſiſtance from the <hi>Leggs</hi> at all, but as the Horſe is turning you muſt take care, to turn your <hi>body</hi> well to the <hi>Turn,</hi> and alſo look upon the inſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> and thus let him turn, once, twice, or thrice, as you ſhall think fit, See Plate fifth figure third.</p>
                     <p>Now when you intend to make a Horſe go the <hi>Piroyte,</hi> you ſhould <hi>Gallop</hi> him upon a <hi>Square,</hi> and cauſe him <hi>Piroyte</hi> upon each <hi>corner</hi> of it, once or twice, and then gain the next ſide of the <hi>ſquare,</hi> and when you are at the other <hi>corner, Piroyte</hi> him again, and do this upon every <hi>corner,</hi> ſo long as you continue your repriſe, you may alſo <hi>Piroyte</hi> him upon the end of <hi>Paſſads,</hi> which will make him very <hi>ready</hi> and uſeful for a ſingle <hi>Combat.</hi>

                     <p>Do as much upon the other <hi>hand,</hi> and then begin to <hi>Trot</hi> him upon the ſame <hi>ſtraight line, ſtoping, raiſing</hi> him <hi>before,</hi> and turning him as you did upon the <hi>Walk,</hi> and when he is perfect upon the <hi>Trot,</hi> then put him to a <hi>ſhort Gallop</hi> upon the <hi>ſtraight line,</hi> alſo <hi>ſtoping</hi> and advancing him as you did before; but now let him perform his <hi>Demy Tour</hi> or <hi>Volt</hi> not by <hi>Paſſaging,</hi> but upon his <hi>Avre,</hi> and when he is perfect in this, then let him make a <hi>paſſade</hi> upon a <hi>ſhort Gallop,</hi> without either <hi>ſtoping</hi> or <hi>raiſing before,</hi> but only turning when at the end of the <hi>ſtraight line,</hi> which he will do exactly in a very ſhort time, but you muſt remember in <hi>Galloping</hi> to keep his head alwayes a little from the <hi>Wall,</hi> that his <hi>Croup</hi> may come to it, and ſo keep the <hi>line</hi> that he falſifie not his <hi>Demy Volt,</hi> alſo before he <hi>turns</hi> it will not be a miſs to cauſe him make two or three <hi>Falcads</hi> or <hi>times,</hi> to firm his <hi>Haunches</hi> the better, and to make him alſo <hi>turn</hi> with the better <hi>Grace.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be here objected, that if a man in a ſingle <hi>Combat</hi> make uſe of theſe <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cads,</hi> or half <hi>ſtops,</hi> which I order before he <hi>turn</hi> upon the end of his <hi>paſſade,</hi> it will give oportunity to his Adverſary to gain his <hi>Croup,</hi> which is accounted a very conſiderable advantage in a ſingle <hi>combat;</hi> To which I anſwer, That it cannot be denyed, but that ſuch half <hi>ſtops</hi> have that inconveniency: But upon the other hand, if a Man do not make uſe of them upon <hi>paſſads</hi> at <hi>full ſpeed,</hi> he will run into another inconveniency which is large as dangerous, and that is, That his horſe being upon his full <hi>carrier,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he make him form thoſe <hi>half ſtops,</hi> he will be in danger of coming over every time he <hi>turneth,</hi> being riding with ſuch force as a Man ſhould alwayes do in <hi>paſſading,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave it to your choice which of the two hazards you would rather undergo, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have your horſe fall upon you, and perhaps break a Legg, or to have your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary upon your <hi>Croup,</hi> in my opinion the laſt of the two is the ſafeſt, eſpecially if you are upon a ready horſe, and be alſo any thing of a <hi>Sword-man</hi> your ſelf; Therefore I ſhall diſcourſe no more of it, but leave the Event to be decided by your Skill upon Horſe-back, and Dexterity in handleing the <hi>weapon,</hi> wherewith you are engadged.</p>

                        <p>A <hi>Peſate,</hi> is when a Horſe riſeth handſomly <hi>before,</hi> and upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> and at the ſame time bends his <hi>fore leggs</hi> up to his <hi>Body;</hi> now this is ſo neceſſary an Action, that without a Horſe can do it perfectly, he ſhall never go well in any <hi>Ayre,</hi> and therefore before I proceed to them, I ſhall ſhow how to cauſe your Horſe perform an exact <hi>Peſate,</hi> which is thus, the <hi>Cavezons inward Rein</hi> being in your <hi>hand,</hi> or tyed to the <hi>Pomel,</hi> help him with the <hi>outward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> and in <hi>Paſſaging</hi> raiſe him as high as you can, and hold him there gently, and without <hi>fougne,</hi> or giving him occaſion to fret, then walk him away a little, and afterwards raiſe him again, and do this quite round the <hi>Volt</hi> or large <hi>Circle</hi> you are working him upon, which will make him in a ſhort time form a right and very juſt <hi>Peſate:</hi> Now the teaching of your Horſe <hi>Peſates,</hi> muſt be the firſt <hi>Leſſon</hi> before ever you offer to put him upon any <hi>Ayre,</hi> for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more graceful in all <hi>Ayres,</hi> then to ſee a Horſe bend his <hi>fore leggs</hi> well up to his <hi>Body,</hi> but there is alſo more in it then that, becauſe whatever Horſe goeth in <hi>Ayres,</hi> if his <hi>fore leggs</hi> be ſtiff before, or that he <hi>Paws</hi> with his <hi>fore feet,</hi> he is neceſſarly upon his <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> for that ſtiffneſs of his <hi>fore Leggs</hi> and <hi>pawing,</hi> puts him upon them, whereas if he did bend his <hi>fore Leggs</hi> up to his <hi>Body,</hi> it would put him upon the <hi>Haunehes,</hi> becauſe it pulls him backward, as being ſtiff before puts him foreward, and conſequently upon the <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> but if you find your Horſe very much oppoſe you when you firſt attempt to make him <hi>riſe before,</hi> then put him as I have already told you betwixt the <hi>Pillars</hi> for ſome dayes, and then no doubt he will yeeld to you; for this is all the uſe in my opinion that the <hi>Pillars</hi> ſerve for, and therefore keep him as ſhort while there as poſſible, See Plate fifth, figure fourth and fifth.</p>

                        <p>For when a Horſe is between the <hi>Pillars,</hi> or at the <hi>fingle pillar</hi> as I ſhall ſhow you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and no <hi>Body</hi> upon his <hi>Back,</hi> he goeth as juſt as can be, and yet he hath no <hi>Leggs</hi> to help him there, therefore I ſay you are not to help him with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all, for if you ſhould help him with your <hi>Outward Legg,</hi> then he will think he muſt go <hi>Terra a Terra relevé,</hi> and if he ſhould in this poſture performe his <hi>Corvets,</hi> he will go all a wray, and lean on the <hi>Outſide,</hi> ſo again if you help him with the <hi>Inward Legg,</hi> he will put out his <hi>Croup,</hi> and lean all on the <hi>Inſide,</hi> and if you ſhould help him with both your <hi>Leggs,</hi> it would preſs him too much, and make him go too quick a time, therefore I ſay again, that the right way is to help him only with the <hi>Bridle,</hi> and not with your <hi>Legg:</hi> at all.</p>
                        <p>But if your Horſe ſhould of his own accord put in his <hi>Croup</hi> too much, then of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you muſt put it out with your <hi>Inward legg,</hi> and if he puts it out too much, then you are alſo to put it in with your <hi>Outward legg:</hi> But except in theſe Caſes, or that he go not enough forwards at each time, I would adviſe you never to help him with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If your Horſe beat upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> it is becauſe he doth not endure or obey the <hi>Curb,</hi> and in that Caſe, you muſt raiſe him very high upon <hi>Peſates</hi> and hold him there, which will put him upon the <hi>Curb,</hi> and make him to endure it, but if this will not do, then <hi>Gallop</hi> him upon a <hi>ſtreight line</hi> by a <hi>Wall</hi> or otherwayes, and from his <hi>Gallep</hi> ſtay him upon the <hi>hand,</hi> and then let him go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> or let him <hi>Gallop</hi> forewards a <hi>ſhort Gallop,</hi> then <hi>ſtop him</hi> and <hi>raiſe him</hi> three or four <hi>Peſates</hi> very high, and hold him on the <hi>hand</hi> when he is up, and this in all probability will cure him, if not, then <hi>Trot him</hi> and <hi>ſtop him with good hard Stops,</hi> and alſo pull him back ſometimes, and this will ſettle him on the <hi>hand</hi> I warrant you, your <hi>Stirrups</hi> being of an equal length, except you have one

                     <p>Again, ſome would have <hi>leaping Horſes</hi> to be of a huge and vaſt Strength, have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Mouth</hi> and perfect good <hi>Feet,</hi> in which laſt they do not ſay amiſs, for good <hi>Feet</hi> are very requiſite, elſe a Horſe dares never light upon them for fear of hurting himſelf, no more then a Man who hath the <hi>Gout</hi> dares <hi>leap,</hi> and therefore ſuch a Horſe will never <hi>Riſe</hi> as he ſhould, to perform his <hi>Leaps</hi> perfectly.</p>
                     <p>As for a good <hi>Mouth,</hi> I could indeed wiſh that a Horſe which is deſigned for a <hi>Leaper</hi> had one, that is, a good <hi>Apuy</hi> which is neither too hard not too delicat; but ſuch a one as can endure a good <hi>preſsure</hi> upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and ſo to ſuffer the <hi>Curb,</hi> which is what is to be underſtood by a good <hi>Mouth,</hi> yet I muſt tell you, there have been many rate <hi>leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horſes,</hi> which have not at all gone upon the <hi>Curb,</hi> but upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> for which they were not to be commended, but it was better for to have them <hi>leap</hi> ſo, being ſo rare Horſes, then not to ſuffer them to <hi>leap</hi> at all, becauſe they went not upon the <hi>Curb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the third Property of a <hi>leaping Horſe,</hi> which is that he ſhould be very ſtrong; is I think a very great Errour, becauſe it is not the ſtrongeſt Horſes which are fitteſt for the <hi>delight of the Mannage,</hi> eſpecially to be <hi>leaping Horſes:</hi> And the Reaſon is, when Horſes are very ſtrong, they muſt be <hi>Galloped</hi> a long time before you can abaite the ſtrength of their <hi>Chines,</hi> and all that while they will do nothing but <hi>Yerke,</hi> and gives ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Countertimes</hi> and <hi>falſe leaps,</hi> that the beſt Horſeman in the World ſhall never make good <hi>Leapers</hi> of them, ſo you ſee they are not the ſtrongeſt, but beſt diſpoſed Horſes, which are the fitteſt to be made <hi>Leapers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall yet further confirm this Truth by a Compariſon taken from Men, for take one of the ſtrongeſt Fellows you can get, and I ſhall bring a little Man that ſhall <hi>outleap</hi> him ſeveral feet, yet that ſtrong Fellow would Cruſh the little one to Death in his Armes, ſo you ſee it is not Strength, but Diſpoſition that fits Horſes as well as Men for <hi>Leaping.</hi> Its true, that ſometimes a great and ſtrong Fellow will <hi>outleap</hi> a little Man, but that is rare, becauſe the Spirits of ſuch bigg Men, are more dilated and diffuſed than in little Men: The like is I aſſure you in Horſes as well as amongſt men, for there may be a ſtrong Horſe diſpoſed for <hi>leaping,</hi> and that horſe will no doubt be an excellent <hi>Leaper,</hi> but for the moſt part, they are weak Horſes which are moſt diſpoſed for <hi>leaping,</hi> Sometimes alſo Horſes which are very weak, find themſelves ſo <hi>pincht</hi> upon the <hi>haunches</hi> with <hi>Corvets,</hi> that they find eaſe in <hi>leaping,</hi> thus you ſee then that Horſes are generally more diſpoſed by <hi>Nature</hi> than <hi>Art</hi> for <hi>leaping,</hi> which is when they are full of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and light, ſo that Horſemen have nothing almoſt to do in making <hi>leaping Horſes,</hi> but only to give them the time, which is the greateſt part of the <hi>Art,</hi> which is to be made uſe of in making of them, and he who thinks to ſhow more of his <hi>Art</hi> in dreſſing a Horſe for <hi>leaps,</hi> in ſtead of ſhowing his skill, diſcovers only more of his own ignorance and folly: Therefore the ſhort and only true way to dreſs all <hi>leaping Horſes,</hi> is this which followeth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, For <hi>Capriols</hi> walk your Horſe <hi>foreward,</hi> and then cauſe him <hi>make one leap,</hi> preſently after <hi>raiſing him high</hi> upon a <hi>peſate</hi> or two, and <hi>ſtaying</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> him upon the <hi>hand,</hi> and thus augmenting your <hi>leaps,</hi> and diminiſhing your <hi>peſates,</hi> he will by little and little <hi>leap perfectly,</hi> and after he is perfect upon a <hi>ſtreight line forewards,</hi> then you may put him upon <hi>Volts</hi> or <hi>Circles,</hi> and continue the ſame <hi>Method,</hi> but the <hi>Circles</hi> muſt be a little large at firſt, and you muſt remember when you <hi>raiſe him</hi> to <hi>leap,</hi> that you help him with your <hi>Rod behind,</hi> as I have already ſhown you in the Chapter where I diſcourſe of all the <hi>Helps,</hi> and do it with one or more Strokes as you pleaſe, ſo it be done in time, which is when he is <hi>raiſed before,</hi> and alwayes when you are done <hi>leaping,</hi> cauſe him make a high <hi>peſate</hi> or two.</p>
                     <p>As for your <hi>Seat</hi> it muſt be ſtreight, and your <hi>Stirrups</hi> a little ſhorter than ordinary, ſuppoſe a hole or ſo, for too ſhort would throw you out of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> and too long would diſorder your <hi>Seat,</hi> and make you loſe your <hi>Stirrups,</hi> you muſt alſo keep your <hi>Toes</hi> a little down, to ſlack your <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <hi>Knees downwards,</hi> or elſe the Horſe would bolt too much <hi>forwards</hi> each <hi>leap,</hi> for a <hi>leaping Horſe</hi> ſhould never go forewards above a foot and a half at moſt with one <hi>leap,</hi> and when you <hi>raiſe him,</hi> inſtantly put your breaſt out, which will make your <hi>ſhoulders go a little back,</hi> though unſenſible to the Beholders, for if you did it not juſt as the Horſe <hi>riſes before,</hi> it would be to late to do it when he <hi>riſes behind</hi> and <hi>ſtrickes out.</hi>

                     <p>ALthough it muſt be confeſſed,<note place="margin">CHAP: XXXI.</note> that this method of <hi>dreſſing horſes</hi> upon all <hi>Ayres</hi> by the help of one <hi>ſingle pillar,</hi> is far inferiour to theſe moſt excellent Leſſons and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I have been all along giving you, for the more <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>perfect dreſſing</hi> of all kinds of horſes, yet it being Curious and Extraordinary, And alſo in its kind very good, I thought it would be acceptable to a <hi>Curious Reader,</hi> to find here the method of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſet down; Which is as followeth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt bring your Horſe, being <hi>Saddled</hi> and <hi>Bridled</hi> to the <hi>ſingle pillar,</hi> and there put him under the <hi>Button</hi> of the <hi>Bridle Reins,</hi> which is to draw down that little <hi>Button</hi> of <hi>leather</hi> which moveth up and down upon them ſo near to the Horſes <hi>Main,</hi> that it may ſtay and fix the <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> at ſuch a degree of ſtraitneſs, as the Horſe may have but a very gentle feeling at firſt of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> either upon his <hi>Barrs,</hi> or place of the <hi>Curb,</hi> this being done, if you intend to make your horſe go to the <hi>right hand,</hi> let a Groom take the <hi>cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons inward rein</hi> for the <hi>right hand,</hi> and putting it about the <hi>ſingle pillar</hi> a little higher then the <hi>horſes head,</hi> keep it there very ſhort, then let another perſon hold the <hi>long Rein</hi> of the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezon</hi> upon the other, or <hi>outſide</hi> of the <hi>turn,</hi> in <hi>one hand,</hi> and a ſtick with a <hi>botkin</hi> at the end of it in the other, to prick him if he ſhould put out his <hi>Croup</hi> too much, and alſo make another perſon go behind the Horſe with a <hi>Rod</hi> to keep him from <hi>going back,</hi> then do you, or the perſon who is to dreſs the Horſe, being a foot, raiſe him <hi>De firme a firme,</hi> which is ſtill in one place, and be ſatisfied with a very little from him at once, For <hi>Rome was not all built in a day:</hi> Now thus tying him ſhort, he cannot riſe high, and therefore to find his eaſe he goeth upon his <hi>Haunches,</hi> and no thanks to him, becauſe he is forced to it; After you have uſed him ſo a little, then help him with three <hi>Rods,</hi> your ſelf with two before, one upon each <hi>fore Thigh,</hi> and a ſecond perſon with the third under his <hi>Belly,</hi> which will put him very much upon the <hi>Haunebes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After your Horſe can perform his <hi>Leſſon</hi> exactly <hi>De firme a firme,</hi> or in one place, then keeping ſtill the ſame <hi>inward Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> ſhort about the <hi>Pillar,</hi> make him go upon his <hi>Volts,</hi> helping him as I have already told you with three <hi>Rods,</hi> two upon his <hi>fore Thighs,</hi> and one under his <hi>Belly,</hi> but be you then upon the out ſide of the Horſes <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> to give him the more liberty to <hi>Turn,</hi> and thus in a ſhort time he will go perfectly well <hi>Corvets</hi> upon the <hi>Volts</hi> forewads, keep him ſtill ſo tyed with the <hi>Cavezon Rein,</hi> and help

                     </p>
                     <p>When your Horſe is perfect in all this for the <hi>Right hand,</hi> then tye the <hi>left Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> thus about the <hi>Pillar,</hi> as before you did the <hi>Right,</hi> and give him the ſame very helps which I ordred you for the right, only changing ſides, and thus your Horſe will go perfectly upon <hi>Corvets,</hi> both <hi>forewards, backwards, and ſidewayes,</hi> without any perſon upon his <hi>Back,</hi> which is a pretty piece of curioſity, and I believe can be performed by no other method but this.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, When your Horſe goeth perfectly thus without any perſon upon his <hi>back,</hi> then get upon him, the ſame <hi>Rein</hi> of the <hi>Cavezon</hi> being ſtill very ſhort about the <hi>Pillar,</hi> and make him go as you did before in every thing; And after this manner may you make a Horſe go in all other <hi>Ayres,</hi> which is a piece of Art that is curious, and alſo in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſome what Extraordinary, See Plate fifth figure ſixth.</p>

                     <p>And I think this Diſcourſe of <hi>Ambling</hi> ſo much the more needful, becauſe of the great number of Pretenders, who take upon them to teach Horſes perfectly to <hi>Amble,</hi> and yet moſt of them make uſe of different <hi>Methods,</hi> ſome of which are ſo very rediculous, that I think it will be for the Readers advantage, that I in the firſt place diſcover ſome of them to him, that ſo he may know their errors, and not be impoſed upon by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent aſſertions of ſuch, who by ſo unreaſonable <hi>Methods</hi> as I ſhall diſcover to him, pretend to teach all Horſes the perfect <hi>Amble;</hi> the which to make a Horſe go in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is I aſſure you a great deal more difficult, and requireth more <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> then ſuch Pretenders to Skill, or the moſt part of our common <hi>Horſe Courſers</hi> do imagine. therefore</p>

                        <p>FIrſt he looſeth himſelf in the want of Knowledge, for the length of the <hi>ſide Ropes</hi> of the <hi>Tramel,</hi> and either he makes them too long which gives no <hi>ſtrock,</hi> or too ſhort which gives <hi>a falſe ſtrock;</hi> the firſt makes a Horſe <hi>Hackle</hi> and <hi>ſhuffle</hi> his <hi>feet</hi> confuſedly, the latter makes him <hi>roul</hi> and <hi>twitch</hi> up his <hi>hinder feet</hi> ſo ſuddenly, that by cuſtome it brings him to a <hi>ſtring halt,</hi> from which he will hardly be recovered ever after. Another loſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his labour by miſplacing the <hi>Tramel,</hi> and out of a niceneſs to ſeem more expert than he is, or out of fearfulneſs to prevent falling (to which the <hi>Tramel</hi> is ſubject) places them above the <hi>Knee,</hi> and above the <hi>hinder foot hoof,</hi> but the <hi>Rule</hi> is neither good nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for if the <hi>Tramel</hi> be too long or looſe, that is, gives no offence to the <hi>ſinews</hi> and other <hi>ligaments,</hi> about which the <hi>hoſe</hi> muſt neceſſarly be faſtned, when they are raiſed ſo high then they can give no <hi>true ſtrock,</hi> neither can the <hi>fore legg</hi> compel the <hi>hinder</hi> to follow it; And if they be ſo ſhort or ſtrait, that the <hi>fore legg</hi> cannot <hi>ſtep foreward,</hi> but the <hi>hinder</hi> muſt go equal with it, then will it ſo preſs the <hi>Main ſinew</hi> of the <hi>hinder legg,</hi> and the <hi>Veins</hi> &amp; <hi>fleſhy part</hi> of the <hi>fore thighs,</hi> that the Horſe will not be able to go without <hi>halting</hi> before, &amp; <hi>cringing</hi> and <hi>crambling</hi> his <hi>hinder parts</hi> ſo ill favouredly, that it will be very unpleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, beſides it will occaſion <hi>ſwellings,</hi> and draw down humours, which will be more noyſome than the <hi>Pace</hi> will be benefical.</p>

                        <p>For the <hi>hoſe</hi> which muſt be placed in the ſmall of the <hi>fore legg,</hi> and the ſmall of the <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legg,</hi> above the <hi>paſtern joints,</hi> they muſt be made of fine <hi>girt-web</hi> which is ſoft and pliant, and loined with <hi>double cotton,</hi> over the <hi>girt-web</hi> muſt be faſtened ſtrong <hi>tabbs</hi> of <hi>white Neats leather</hi> well Tallowed, and ſuted to an evenlength, and ſtamped with holes at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which <hi>Tabbs</hi> ſhall paſs through the nooſes of the <hi>ſide ropes,</hi> &amp; be made longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at pleaſure with very ſtrong <hi>buckels,</hi> &amp; which <hi>Hoſe</hi> are to be made faſt about the horſes <hi>leggs</hi> with <hi>ſmall buckels,</hi> now theſe <hi>hoſe</hi> of <hi>girt</hi> would be four inches in length, and the long <hi>tabbs</hi> with the <hi>large buckels</hi> ten.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>back-band</hi> being of no other uſe, but to bear up the <hi>ſide ropes,</hi> would (if you <hi>tramel</hi> all the <hi>four leggs</hi>) be made of fine <hi>girt-web,</hi> and loined with <hi>cotton,</hi> but if you <hi>tramel</hi> but <hi>one ſide,</hi> then an ordinary <hi>tape</hi> will ſerve, being ſure that it carries the <hi>ſide ropes</hi> in an even line without either <hi>riſeing</hi> or <hi>falling;</hi> for if it <hi>riſe,</hi> it ſhortens the <hi>ſide rope,</hi> and if it falls, it endangers <hi>tangleing,</hi> Thus you ſee what the true <hi>tramel</hi> is, and how to be made, See Plate fifth, figure ninth, Now touching the uſe of it, it thus followeth;</p>

                        <p>And that this may be done with more eaſe and leſs amazement to the horſe, it is not amiſs (at his firſt <hi>Tramling</hi>) that you give your ſide <hi>Ropes</hi> more length then ordinary, both that the <hi>twitches</hi> may be leſs ſudden, and the <hi>Motion</hi> coming more gently, the Horſe may ſooner apprehend it; But as ſoon as he comes to any perfectneſs, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put the ſide <hi>Ropes</hi> to their true length, for an inch too long, is a foot too ſlow in the <hi>Pace,</hi> and an inch too ſhort cauſeth <hi>Rouling,</hi> a <hi>twitching</hi> up of the <hi>Leggs,</hi> and indeed a kind of <hi>Plain halting.</hi>

                        <p>WHen the horſe will thus <hi>Amble</hi> in your hand perfectly, being <hi>Tramled</hi> on one ſide; you ſhall then change them to the other ſide, and make him <hi>Amble</hi> in your hand as you did before, and thus you ſhall do, changing them from one ſide to another, till with the half <hi>Tramel</hi> he will <hi>Run</hi> and <hi>Amble</hi> in your hand, without ſnappering or ſtumbling, both readily &amp; ſwiftly; when this is attained unto, which cannot be above two or three hours labour (if there be any Tractableneſs) you may then put on the whole <hi>Tramel,</hi> with the <hi>broad flat Backband, Tramling</hi> both ſides equally, See Plate fifth, figure Ninth, And ſo <hi>Run</hi> him in your hand, (at the utmoſt length of the <hi>Bridle</hi>) up and down the <hi>Roade</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, then <hi>pauſe cheriſh,</hi> and to it again, and thus exerciſe him, till you have brought him to that <hi>perfection</hi> that he will <hi>Amble</hi> ſwiftly, truly, and readily, when, where, and how you pleaſe, then put him upon uneven and uncertain wayes, as up <hi>hill</hi> and down <hi>hill,</hi> where there are Clots and roughneſs, and where there is hollowneſs and falſe treading.</p>
                        <p>5ly. <hi>When to</hi> Mount <hi>his</hi> Back.</p>
                        <p>WHen he is thus perfect in your hand upon all theſe, you may then adventure to <hi>Mount</hi> his <hi>Back,</hi> which (if you pleaſe) you may firſt do by a Boy, or <hi>Groom,</hi> making the horſe <hi>Amble</hi> under him, whilſt you lead &amp; ſtay his head to prevent danger, or to ſee how he ſtriketh, then after <hi>Mount</hi> your ſelf &amp; with all Gentleneſs &amp; Lenity encreaſe his <hi>Pace</hi> more &amp; more, till you come to the hight of <hi>Perfection,</hi> &amp; thus as you did before in your <hi>hand,</hi> ſo do now on his back, firſt with the half <hi>Tramel,</hi> then with the <hi>whole,</hi> and change the <hi>tramel</hi> from one ſide to another, &amp; alſo alter grounds, till you find that Exquiſiteneſs which you deſire, and this muſt be done by <hi>daily Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> as twice or thrice in the day.</p>

                        <p>Now if in this Journeying, either through Wearineſs, Ignorance, or Peeviſhneſs, you find in him a willingneſs to forfake his <hi>pace,</hi> then (ever carrying in your pocket the half <hi>tramel</hi>) alight and put it on, and ſo Exerciſe him with it, and now and then giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him eaſe bring him home in his <hi>true pace;</hi> this Exerciſe you ſhall follow day by day, and every day encreaſe it more and more, till you have brought him from one <hi>Mile</hi> to many; which done you may then give him eaſe, as letting him reſt a day or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179659:197"/>two, or more, and then Exerciſe him again, and if you find in him neither Error nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, then you may conclude your work is finiſhed. But if any Alteration do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to which many <hi>phantaſtick horſes</hi> are ſubject, if it be in the <hi>motion</hi> of his <hi>Pace,</hi> then with your hand reform it, but if that fail, then the uſe of the half <hi>Tramel</hi> will never fail you.</p>
                        <p>Now If the errour proceed from any other occaſion, look ſeriouſly into the cauſe thereof, and taking that away the effect will ſoon ceaſe; For you are to underſtand, that in this manner of teaching a Horſe to <hi>Amble,</hi> you are forbidden no help whatſoever which belongs to <hi>Horſemanſhip:</hi> There might be a great dale more ſpoken upon this Subject of <hi>Ambling,</hi> but ſeeing my intention in this Treatiſe, is to diſcover and teach nothing, but what is both true &amp; experienced, I ſhall weave diſcourſing any more of it in this place, and therefore ſhall proceed to the next Chapter, wherein as I have already told you, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to treat of the moſt conſiderable <hi>vices,</hi> Horſes are commonly ſubject to when either <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> or <hi>Mannaging,</hi> with the moſt reaſonable and approved <hi>Methods</hi> to cure and rectifie them.</p>

                        <p>THe moſt part of <hi>Writers</hi> on <hi>Horſemanſhip,</hi> as well <hi>Ancient</hi> as <hi>Modern,</hi> are mightily troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and concerned, about the <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Imperfections</hi> of a <hi>Horſes Mouth,</hi> for Example, the firſt is, when a Horſe <hi>pulls</hi> and <hi>ſucks</hi> up his <hi>Tongue;</hi> The ſecond, when he puts his <hi>Tongue</hi> over the <hi>Bitt:</hi> The third, when he doubleth it about the <hi>Bitt:</hi> And the fourth, when he letteth his <hi>Tongue</hi> hang out of his <hi>Mouth,</hi> either before, or upon one ſide of it; for all which they have taken a great dale of pains, with many curious devices and inventions, and a great dale of labour to cure them; ſo as there ſeveral <hi>Writings</hi> about theſe particular <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>mouth,</hi> would make a great <hi>Volume,</hi> when in truth moſt of their <hi>Bitts</hi> deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie theſe <hi>Imperfections,</hi> are greater <hi>vices</hi> then theſe they would rectifie, and their <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> worſe then the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> which bringeth more inconveniencies along with it, then the <hi>Vices</hi> they go about to cure.</p>
                        <p>For my own part, I could indeed wiſh that a horſe had none of theſe faults, but put the caſe he hath, as putting his <hi>Tongue out,</hi> over the <hi>Bitt,</hi> or <hi>ſucking</hi> or <hi>drawing</hi> of it up, or <hi>doubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, all theſe I wiſh were not, but if they be, the Horſe is little or not at all prejudiced by them, for he will have as good an <hi>Apuy</hi> or <hi>feeling</hi> of the <hi>Bitt</hi> with them as without them, and will be as <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſteddy</hi> in the <hi>hand,</hi> and as ſenſible of the <hi>Barrs</hi> and <hi>Curb,</hi> as if thoſe <hi>Vices</hi> were not; becauſe the <hi>Bitt</hi> will reſt and work ſtill upon his <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the <hi>Curb</hi> in its due place where it ought, in ſpight of his <hi>Tongue,</hi> let it be where it will, for if a Horſes <hi>Tongue</hi> ſhould be cut out, would that hinder the <hi>Bitt</hi> from working upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> or the <hi>Curb</hi> to work in its due place? Certainly not at all, Nay horſes have been known to have had their <hi>Tongues</hi> pulled out by the <hi>Roots,</hi> and yet have Rid afterwards as juſtly as ever they did before, ſo the carrying of the <hi>tongue</hi> this or that way out of the <hi>mouth,</hi> although I confeſs it is not very becoming, yet it is but of little conſequence for true going in the <hi>mannage,</hi> becauſe as I ſaid, the <hi>bitt</hi> will alwayes <hi>work</hi> upon the <hi>barrs</hi> and <hi>curb,</hi> whither the horſe have a <hi>tongue</hi> or not, and it is this working of the <hi>bitt,</hi> which maketh a horſe go

                        <p>Tye therefore your Horſe very ſhort between the <hi>Pillars</hi> with a <hi>Rope Cavezon,</hi> without any perſon upon his <hi>Back,</hi> and with a Stick about ſix foot long, pointed at one end with an <hi>Iron Punchion</hi> or <hi>Needle,</hi> prick your Horſe upon the outſide of his <hi>Thigh,</hi> to make him <hi>ſtrick out,</hi> and when he doth it make much of him, continue thus to make him <hi>ſtrick out,</hi> untill he do it eaſily, and without any kind of difficulty, which will be in two or three Dayes at moſt, if you continue it for half an hour each Day, when you find that he <hi>ſtricks out</hi> when ever you offer to prick him, although you do not touch him with the <hi>Needle,</hi> then take his <hi>Back</hi> ſtill between the <hi>Pillars,</hi> and keeping the <hi>Bridle</hi> a little long in your <hi>Left Hand,</hi> help him behind the <hi>Saddle</hi> with your <hi>Right,</hi> in which you muſt have a ſhort <hi>Punchion,</hi> another perſon upon foot at the ſame time, helping with the <hi>Stick</hi> upon his <hi>Thigh,</hi> and if he <hi>ſtrick out</hi> eaſily with you upon his <hi>Back,</hi> then <hi>Careſss</hi> him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſeveral Dayes this <hi>Leſſon,</hi> until you find him <hi>ſtrick out</hi> by the help only of the <hi>Punchion</hi> which is in your <hi>Right hand,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Stick</hi> upon his <hi>Thigh,</hi> which will be in four or five Dayes at fartheſt, then take him from between the <hi>Pillan,</hi> and put him to the <hi>ſingle pillar</hi> with a long <hi>Rope,</hi> which muſt be kept about it by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is a foot, and there make him <hi>ſtrick out</hi> in one place with the help of your <hi>Right hand,</hi> and of the <hi>long ſtick</hi> upon his <hi>Thigh</hi> if need be, afterwards make him <hi>go fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> two or three <hi>Steps,</hi> and then make him <hi>ſtrick out</hi> three or four times upon end, and thus continue firſt <hi>Stepping</hi> or <hi>VValking him,</hi> and then making him <hi>ſtrick out,</hi> untill he perform it a whole <hi>Round</hi> without making one <hi>Step</hi> or <hi>VValk,</hi> but alwayes <hi>ſtricking out;</hi> when he is brought this length, then <hi>Gallop</hi> him about the <hi>Pillar,</hi> and as you <hi>ſtop</hi> him make him <hi>ſtrick out,</hi> without raiſing him at all <hi>before,</hi> and if he ſhould offer to <hi>riſe</hi> of his own accord, then make uſe of your <hi>Punchion</hi> behind the <hi>Saddle,</hi> which will at that inflant of time make him <hi>ſtrick out,</hi> and ſo prevent his <hi>riſing before,</hi> and uſing him thus for ſome time he will be ſo accuſtomed to it, that he will not ſo much as offer to <hi>riſe before</hi> at all, let alone to come over or <hi>Renverſe,</hi> even although you ſhould <hi>Gallop</hi> him in the Fields, and without any kind of <hi>Longe</hi> or <hi>Rope</hi> fixed to the <hi>Bridle,</hi> and all this in the ſpace of eight or ten Dayes at fartheſt, I have had experience of this <hi>Remedy</hi> for <hi>Renverſing</hi> many a time, and it never yet failed me, ſo that after I have made uſe of it for eight or ten Dayes, I make no difficultie to give them the <hi>Spurrs</hi> ſharply if they need them, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179659:200"/>vet they never think of <hi>riſing before:</hi> when you have once brought him from <hi>riſing before,</hi> it is an eaſie matter to cure him of his <hi>ſtricking out,</hi> ſo here you ſee is a <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Defence</hi> rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very ſhort time by its <hi>Contrary,</hi> and without any kind of difficulty or danger to the Rider.</p>
                        <p>If I have not in this Chapter named all the <hi>Vices</hi> with their <hi>Remedies,</hi> which the moſt part of <hi>croſs natured Horſes</hi> are ſubject to, and defend themſelves by when <hi>dreſſing,</hi> it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Horſes who are Rid according to the Method I have preſcrived in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, are not ſubject to them, becauſe they are not too much troubled and preſſed, for by this <hi>Method</hi> you follow <hi>Nature,</hi> and make every thing become eaſie to them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and do not <hi>force</hi> and <hi>preſs</hi> them either with the <hi>ſtroacks</hi> of the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> or <hi>laſhes</hi> of the <hi>Shambriet,</hi> and as by <hi>practiſe</hi> they become <hi>ſupple</hi> and <hi>eaſie,</hi> they preſs themſelves of their own accord, and aim at nothing elſe but to obey, for it is a fooliſh thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to make a Horſe obedient and ready in eight or ten Daves time, by the <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Blows,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>Force</hi> as I have elſe where told you, but good and methodical <hi>Leſſons</hi> judiciouſly applyed, which make and dreſs Horſes, and render them perfectly obedient to the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heel;</hi> and if I be not very much miſtaken, you have in this Treatiſe as true and <hi>Artificial Ones,</hi> for the <hi>Dreſſing</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> of Horſes, and alſo deſcrived with as few Repetitions, as you will find in any Book as yet extant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practiſe them with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> and I make no doubt, when once you have a little tryal of them, but you will acknowledge them, notwithſtanding of their being thus <hi>compendized,</hi> preſerable to the many and unneceſſary Varietys, of larger and more expenſive Volums.</p>

                           <hi>FIRST. The Modern way of preparing a Horſe for a</hi> Courſe <hi>or</hi> Match.</head>
                        <p>SEing <hi>Racing</hi> or <hi>Horſe Matching</hi> is ſo highly eſteemed by the Gentry of theſe Iſlands, and that a good horſe for that purpoſe is much lookt upon and coveted, by thoſe who delight in this ſhort and fickle, although it muſt be confeſſed (during its continuance) very pleaſing Divertiſement, I ſhall in this Chapter endeavour to give you ſome inſight in it, and firſt, in chuſing a horſe for Running, ſee that he be tractable and no wayes Reſty or <hi>Skittiſh,</hi> but familiar with his Keeper, and ſprightfull in his <hi>Looks</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> let him have alſo an indifferent large reach, and a great ſhare of <hi>beels</hi> if poſſible, For take my word for it, that is a chief ingredient in a <hi>Running horſe,</hi> Wind and Length being with a great dale of more eaſe increaſed by Art, then <hi>heels</hi> and ſwiftneſs, alſo let him (if poſſible) be altogether well ſhaped, that is, well ſet in the Shoulders, well turned in the <hi>Buttock</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoyns,</hi> and well Coupled in the <hi>ſhort Ribs,</hi> his <hi>Leggs</hi> right planted, and to be ſure let him have good feet, for theſe are both the foundation, and Wings of this <hi>Flying Machine</hi> upon earth; his head ſmall and ſlender, with lean and firm <hi>Cheek bones,</hi> a ſharp or <hi>Hauk noſe, wide noſtirls,</hi> and a large <hi>Throple,</hi> his Age not beneath ſix, no horſe under that Age having ſufficient ſtrength and vigour, either to furniſh a four mile courſe or heats, without Running the hazard of being over ſtrained, all their Bones and Joints being only a kind of firm Griſtle, neither is this all, for the main point of bringing him into a condition to run ſucceſsfully, is yet to be ſpoak to, which conſiſts in Dyeting, and carefully ordering him before the day appointed for the <hi>Match,</hi> and therefore I ſhall firſt diſcourſe of the Limitation of time, to be allowed for preparing a <hi>Running horſe</hi> for any ordinary <hi>Plate</hi> or <hi>Match,</hi> that is not for too extraordinary a ſumm, becauſe all Judicious Horſemen muſt acknowledge this for a truth, that the longer a horſe be in good Keeping, providing no accident intervene, the better heat he will make when ſtrained, becauſe Cuſtom and Practice without exceſs, do convert any exerciſe a moſt into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> prepare any Horſe for a</hi> Match.</p>
                        <p>THerefore as for the Limitation of time for a <hi>Plate</hi> or ſmall ſum of money, I allow but of two Moneths at any time of the year what ſoever, for an old horſe, or a horſe formerly traintd, for I ſpeak not here of <hi>Colts,</hi> and I am perſwaded that if a horſe make not a good heat in two Moneths, he will not make it in fifteen.</p>
                        <p>Yet many do affirm, that a horſe newly taken from the Graſs, and ſoul, cannot be prepared under ſix Moneths, by which they Rob their Maſters of four Moneths pleaſure, engadge him in an expenſive charge, which will make the ſport become loathſome and uneaſie to him, and can get nothing to defend and cloak what they ſay withal, but their ignorance, and perhaps a few falſe got Crowns which evaniſh ſo ſoon as gained, yet as <hi>Hereticks</hi> cite Scripture, ſo theſe people find Reaſons to defend their want of skill and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as the danger of too violent Exerciſe, the offence of Greaſe too ſuddenly melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the moving of humors too haſtily, which leads to mortal ſickneſs, and the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and helping of all theſe by a ſlow proceeding, or bringing the horſe into order by degrees and time, or as I may rather ſay by an ignorant delay and ſufferance.</p>
                        <p>Now all theſe Reaſons if but ſuperficially viewed, ſeem to have ſomewhat of <hi>Foret</hi> in them, for too early Exerciſe is dangerous, but not if given moderatly, and free from violence; to break or melt Greaſe too ſuddenly, is an offence inſufferable, for it putteth both <hi>Limbs</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> in hazard, but not if it be purged away with wholſome <hi>Scourings;</hi> The haſty ſtirring up of Humors in the Body where they ſuperabound, and are generally diſperſed and not ſettled, cannot choiſe but breed ſickneſs, but not where <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> expel and evacuat them, with wholſome and moderate <hi>Airings;</hi> And as for moderating of all theſe by the length and tediouſneſs of time, as two <hi>Moneths</hi> for the firſt and two <hi>Moneths</hi> for the ſecond, and as much for the laſt, it is like the ouring of a <hi>Gangaren</hi> in an Old Man, <hi>Better to die then be diſmembrrd, better looſe the Prize or Beats then bear the Charges,</hi> for I appail to any <hi>Noble Judgement</hi> whoſe Purſe hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſuch <hi>Actions,</hi> if ſix Moneths Preparation with the Dependants to it, doth not eat up and devour the better half of a twenty five or thirty pound Wager, therefore for any ordinary Match or Beat, I allow as I ſaid but of two Months to prepare a Horſe for it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt certain, that a Horſe who cannot make a good heat in that time, will very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179659:201"/>rarely make an Extraordinary one, though you ſhould Dyet him <hi>triple</hi> or <hi>quadruple</hi> that ſpace.</p>
                        <p>2ly. <hi>Of</hi> Scourings <hi>and their uſe</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUt Reply they, <hi>No Scourings are to be allowed, becauſe they are Phyſical, force Nature, and ſo are prejudicial to her, by occaſioning ſickneſs, and emparing health, and therefore nothing is comparable to the length of time, becauſe Nature worketh every thing of her ſelf, and although ſhe do it but ſlowly, yet ſhe doth it with ſo much the leſs danger.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I indeed confeſs that <hi>ſcourings</hi> given immoderately, and which are ſtuft with unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and poyſonous ingredients, cannot chooſe but bring on infirmity and ſickneſs, but wholſome <hi>ſcourings,</hi> which are compoſed of Beneficial and Nouriſhing Simples, neither occaſion ſickneſs, nor any manner of infirmity, but bring away Greaſe and all foulneſs ſo abundantly, and in ſo kindly a manner, that by the moderate uſe of them you ſhall effect more in one Week, then in two moneths by a Dilatory and Doubtful forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them; I call it Dilatory and Doubtful, becauſe no Man in this lingering courſe, can certainly tell which way the Greaſe and foulneſs will be voided or expelled, as whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his dung which is the ſafeſt, or by ſweat which is hazardous, or by his Limbs which is very dangerous; Or laſtly, if it will remain and putrefie in his body, which proveth oft times mortal, ſince the Iſſue of any or all theſe fall out, according to the ſtrength and condition a Horſes body is brought to, by the care and diligence of his Keeper, for if either the one fail in Power, or the other in Care and Diligence, Farewell Horſe for that Match.</p>
                        <p>Now all this the greateſt Envy cannot chuſe but confeſs, only they have one broken Crutch to ſupport them, and that is, <hi>they know no ſcouring,</hi> and therefore will allow of none, indeed againſt Obſtinacy I am reſolved not to Diſpute, only ſhall appeal to Art and Diſcretion; whither Moderate and Beneficial Purgations, or painfull ſufferance when Nature is offended, be the better Doers, but ſtill they will maintain their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and urge, <hi>That whatſoever is given to a Horſe more then his Natural food, and which he will Naturally and willingly receive, is both improper and unwholſome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, That the Natural Food of Man is Bread only, all other things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> being ſuperfluous, and therefore to be avoided; But we find by Experience and the general practice of Mankind, that both <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> laugh at this Argument, becauſe other helps, as Phyſick, variety of Meats, and diverſe other Means appointed by <hi>Divine Providence</hi> it ſelf, tell the Contemners hereof how groſly they Err, in this fooliſh Opinion, nay allow them a little ſhadow of Truth, that things moſt Natural are moſt Beneficial, then it muſt follow that graſs, or hay which is but withered graſs, are moſt Beneficial becauſe moſt Natural, now graſs is Phyſical, for in it is contained all manner of Simples of what Quality ſoever, as Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, ſo that whatſoever is given in his <hi>ſcourings</hi> which is good, is but what he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Naturally when at Soil, only with this difference, that what he gathered was mixt in a confuſed manner, <hi>contraries</hi> being ſo clap together, that it is not poſſible to judge where the predominant Quality lyeth; but that which we compound is ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Art and Reaſon, that we know how it ſhould work, and accordingly expect the Event, if it be not croſt by ſome extraordinary Diſaſter.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore gladly ask theſe Gentlemen, If they will undertake to prepare their Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Horſe with only Graſs or Hay? But they know in this caſe, that the end of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would be loſs, and therefore they are ſatisfied to allow of Corn, nay diverſe kinds of Corns, ſome <hi>Looſening</hi> as Rye, ſome <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Aſtringent</hi> as Beans, and others <hi>Faten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>increaſing</hi> both <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> as Wheat; Nay they will allow Bread, yea Bread of diverſe compoſitions and mixtures, as one kind before heats, another after, ſome <hi>Quick</hi> of Digeſtion, and others <hi>Slow;</hi> And if this method of Dyeting be not almoſt as Phyſical, as the <hi>gentle ſcourings</hi> which are given by a good and underſtanding Horſeman; I confeſs that all I have ſaid in Vindication of Beneficial and rightly appropriate <hi>ſcourings,</hi> is of no force at all: Nay theſe Contemners of <hi>ſcourings</hi> will yet allow of an Egg, and that mixt with other ingredients, and for Butter and Garlick they will uſe it, though it be never ſo fulſom; the reaſon is, becauſe their knowledge in Phyſick can ariſe to no higher pitch, and ſo Authorized Ignorance will impudently ever wage War with the beſt Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>There are yet another ſort of Feeders, who in a contrary extream run beyond theſe into miſchiefs, and theſe are they who <hi>over ſcoure</hi> their Horſes, and are never at peace and eaſe; but when they are giving of <hi>potions</hi> (which they call <hi>ſcourings</hi>) ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179659:202"/>Cauſe, and alwayes without Judgement and Method, which bring upon a Horſe ſuch untollerable weakneſs, that he is not able to perform any violent Exerciſe; Now from this too little and too much, I would have you to gather a <hi>mean</hi> for <hi>ſcourings</hi> which is founded upon Reaſon, and that is, Firſt, that the Simples be wholſome and propper, nixt that you be ſure there is foulneſs; And laſtly, that the ſtate of the body be ſuch, that you may by your <hi>ſcourings</hi> rightly Adminiſtrate, rather Augment then decreſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and thus ſhall your undertakings be proſperous, and your method of Preparation without controlement: To conclude, I allow two moneths for this preparation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that time ſhall lay down my Directions as followeth.</p>
                        <p>3ly. <hi>Some Conſiderations concerning the different</hi> States <hi>of</hi> Body, <hi>wherein a Horſe ſhall be found when</hi> Matcht.</p>
                        <p>ALbeit the Office of a Feeder belongeth generally to all Horſemen, yet it is in a more particular and Critical ſenſe appropriate only to the Keepers of Running Horſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as other horſes have a general way of being fed, ſo the dyeting of theſe is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, and full of Curioſity and circumſpection, in which whoſoever erreth, ſhall ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bring his horſe to deſtruction then any kind of perfection; To prevent which you are therefore to have regard to three eſtates of Body, in any horſe who is Matcht,</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, If he be very fat, foul, or taken from either <hi>Graſs</hi> or <hi>Soil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond, if he be extream lean and poor, either through over Riding, bad Keeping, or other infirmity.</p>
                        <p>The third and laſt is, if he be in a good and likely ſtate of Body, neither too fat nor too lean, but hath been well kept and moderatly exerciſed.</p>

                           <hi>Fifthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> When you begin your <hi>heat, ſtart</hi> your Horſe <hi>roundly</hi> and <hi>ſharply,</hi> at near a three quarters ſpeed, and if it be upon the day of the Week which his <hi>match</hi> is to fall in, then according to his ſtrength, goodneſs of wind, and chearfulneſs of Spirit, run him the whole courſe thorow, and by no means do any thing in extremity, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his wind, but when you find him a little yeeld, then draw a little and give him eaſe, that he may do all with pleaſure and not with anguiſh, for this manner of training will make him take delight in his <hi>labour,</hi> and ſo the better endure it, but the contrary would bread uneaſineſs, and make his exerciſe become a toil, but if his <hi>heating day</hi> be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any other day of the week, then that his <hi>Match</hi> is to be run upon, then make him only go over the courſe at a ſlow and gentle <hi>Gallop,</hi> only to increaſe his wind, and cauſe <hi>ſweat,</hi> that ſo the <hi>ſcouring</hi> you are to give him after his <hi>heat,</hi> may have ſome looſe greaſe to work upon and bring away, for this is the only deſigne of the ſecond <hi>heat</hi> in each week, otherwiſe were both the heats ſmart, the Horſe would not be able to hold our, there being ſo ſhort an intermiſſion between them, for him to reſt and recover his vigour, therefore you would do well not to miſtake, and in ſtead of two <hi>Heats</hi> in a week which I order, the one to be <hi>ſmart</hi> and the other <hi>gentle,</hi> you give not both with the ſame degree of ſwiftneſs, For that is not at all my meaning, and therefore I deſire you would take notice to it; alſo during the time you courſe him, you ſhall obſerve upon what ground he runneth beſt, as whither up hill or down hill, upon ſmooth ground or tough, upon wet or dry, or upon a Level, or ſome what riſing ground, and according as you find his Nature, ſo Mannage him for your own advantage, and theſe are the moſt conſiderable things to be obſerved in giving of a <hi>Heat.</hi>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> You ſhall keep your <hi>heating</hi> dayes the firſt <hi>Week</hi> of this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> but the ſecond or laſt <hi>Week,</hi> you ſhall forbear one <hi>heat,</hi> and not give your Horſe any five dayes before his <hi>Match,</hi> but for it give him only ſtrong and long Airings, and watering Courſes.</p>
                        <p>You ſhall not need this <hi>Fortnight</hi> to give him any <hi>Scouring</hi> at all, and if morning and Evening during this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> you burn the beſt <hi>Frankincence</hi> in the <hi>Stable,</hi> you will find it very wholſome for your Horſe, and he will alſo mightily delight in it.</p>
                        <p>In this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> when you give him any waſht meat, let it be waſht either in the Whites of Eggs, or a little <hi>Muskadine</hi> or <hi>Cherrie,</hi> for it is moſt wholſome, and prevents purſiveneſs.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Fortnight</hi> give him no Hay, but what he taketh out of your hand after his <hi>heats,</hi> and alſo let that be but in little quantity, and clean Duſted.</p>
                        <p>The laſt week of this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> if the Horſe be a foul feeder, you muſt uſe the <hi>Muzzle</hi> continually, but if a clean feeder, then three dayes before the <hi>match</hi> is ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>The Morning of that day before the day for the <hi>Match,</hi> feed well both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Watering and Airing, and water as at other times, but before noon and afternoon diminiſh his Portion of meat a little, as alſo before and after evening Airing feed as at noon, and water as at other times, but be ſure to come earlier home then ordinary that evening from Airing: For,</p>
                        <p>This Evening you are to <hi>Trim</hi> and <hi>Shoe</hi> your Horſe, and do all extraordinary things of Ornament about him, providing alwayes you take care neither to hinder his feeding nor interrupt his reſt, for I have heard ſome Horſemen ſay, that when they had <hi>ſhod</hi> their Horſes with light <hi>ſhoes</hi> or plates, the night before the courſe, their Horſes have taken ſuch notice thereof, that they would neither eat what they gave them, nor ly down to take any reſt all the night following; But to have ſo much underſtanding and cunning, a Horſe muſt be old and long experienced in this exerciſe, otherwayes he cannot make ſuch ſubtile obſervations: However to paſs over other curioſities, as Pletting the Main and Tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do adviſe you, that things which are of moſt neceſſity and uſe be alwiſe done this day, which is the day before the <hi>match,</hi> rather then upon the morning of the Courſe, becauſe your Horſe that morning, ſhould be troubled as little by handling or otherwiſe, as poſſible.</p>

                        <p>THere is no unreaſonable creature of pleaſure, ſubject to ſo many diſaſterous chances of Fortune as the Horſe, and eſpecially the running Horſe, both by reaſon of the multiplicity of diſeaſes, belonging I may ſay peculiarly to him, as alſo the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his exerciſe, and nice tenderneſs of keeping, therefore it is fit that every keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be Armed with ſuch obſervations, as may be a means for him both to prevent miſchiefs and Accidents, and alſo remide them when they do happen; Therefore the firſt Obſervation I ſhall begin with, ſhall be,</p>

                        <p>2. <hi>Obſervations from the State and Condition of his body, Both laward and Outward.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OUR Keeper muſt obſerve, that the ſtrongeſt ſtate of body (which is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be that which is higheſt and fulleſt of fleſh, ſo it be good, hard, and without inward foulneſs) is alwayes the beſt and ableſt for the performance of great <hi>Matches;</hi> Yet herein he muſt alſo conſider two things, the firſt the ſhape of the horſes body, the ſecond his inclinations and manner of feeding.</p>
                        <p>For the ſhape of the horſes body, there are ſome who are of a round, plump, and cloſs knit ſhape, ſo that they will appear fat and well ſhaped, when they are lean and in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, others again are raw boned, ſlender and looſs knit, and will appear lean and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when they are fat, foul, and full of groſs humours.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe for their inclinations, ſome horſes in feeding will grow plump and luſty outwardly, and carrie (as we ſay) a thick Rib, when they are inwardly lean as may be, and others will appear outwardly lean to the eye, when they are inwardly full of greaſe; Now in this caſe our Feeder hath two helps, the firſt <hi>outward,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>inward,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be alwayes kept from being deceived with ſuch falſe appearances.</p>
                        <p>The outward help is the outward <hi>handling</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> the horſes body generally over all his Ribs, but particularly upon his <hi>ſhort</hi> or <hi>hindermoſt ribs,</hi> and if his fleſh feel generally ſoft and looſe, and the <hi>fingers ſink into it as into down,</hi> then is he without all queſtion foul; but if he be univerſally hard and firm, and only upon the <hi>bindermoſt rib</hi> is ſoftneſs, then he hath greaſe and foul matter within him which he muſt be made ridd of, how lean and poor ſo ever he ſeem in outward appearance.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Inward help,</hi> it is only ſharp <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> and good and <hi>Beneficial Seourings,</hi> for the firſt you are ſure will diſſolve the <hi>foulneſs,</hi> and the later will not fail to bring it away.</p>

                        <p>IN <hi>England</hi> (ſayeth our Author,) they have Horſes which are only deſigned and kept for performing of great <hi>Courſes,</hi> and they delight ſo much in this <hi>Divertiſement,</hi> that they dyet Horſes expreſly for it, ſo that their Horſes who are naturally well <hi>Winded</hi> and extreamly <hi>ſwift,</hi> are put into ſuch a Condition by this manner of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that they perform <hi>Courſes</hi> which are <hi>Incredible,</hi> and that not at a ſlow or round <hi>Gallop</hi> as our Horſes, but at full ſpeed, ſo that people who have never ſeen it can ſcarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perſwaded, that any Horſe could endure and hold out with the violence of ſuch <hi>Courſes,</hi> for five or ſix miles, and yet many Horſes in that Kingdom, are known to furniſh <hi>Carriers</hi> of that length.</p>
                        <p>I have never put this Method I am going to ſhow you in practiſe my ſelf, and therefore ſhall only inſert it at the end of this Book, upon the honeſt Word and Recommendation of a brave <hi>Cavaleer,</hi> who aſſuren me he had it in <hi>England</hi> from a perſon whoſe only Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it was, to prepare and dyet <hi>Running Horſes,</hi> which Horſes are neither charged with <hi>fat</hi> nor too much <hi>fleſh,</hi> but are ſo vigorous and hearty, that they can ſcarſely be paralleled; if your Curioſity lead you to make tryal of this Method, I hope that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving exactly what followeth, you ſhall find Contentment.</p>

                        <p>Two nights before the <hi>Match</hi> he ſhall be put in the <hi>Muzzel</hi> all night, and about two a Clock in the Morning you ſhall give him three <hi>Engliſh Pints,</hi> or three <hi>Scots Mutchkins</hi> of <hi>Sack,</hi> in which you muſt beat twenty or twenty five Yolks of new laid Eggs, then ty him up to the <hi>Rack</hi> for two full hours after he hath taken it, after which mount his back, and immediatly put him to a gentle <hi>Gallop,</hi> then to a full ſpeed as long as his wind will allow it, afterwards to a <hi>Gallop</hi> again to give him wind; and thus you are to exerciſe him for three hours, then cover him, lead him home in your hand, and rubbing him down, and drying him well, ty him up with the <hi>Bridle</hi> to the <hi>Rack</hi> for three hours, after which give him his water, but it muſt now be as hot as he can drink it, and then feed him as at other times.</p>
                        <p>The day of the <hi>Match,</hi> you ſhall give him his former quantity of <hi>Sack</hi> and yolks of Eggs, being well beat together two hours before he is to run, and he muſt be alſo tyed up to the <hi>Rack</hi> ſix hours before that you give him his <hi>Sack:</hi> You are alſo to obſerve that upon the day of the <hi>Match,</hi> and that emediately preceeding it, he is only to eat half his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Bread</hi> at each meal, and alſo but half of the <hi>Wheat</hi> ſhaves that you were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give him.</p>
                        <p>Upon the dayes that your Horſe is not to run, or that it is as yet a pretty while to a <hi>Match</hi> or plate, you are alwayes to feed and exerciſe him as I have told you, only after that you find him exactly prepared, you are not to give him his <hi>Garlick Balls,</hi> but every ninth day.</p>
                        <p>If during the time of his dyeting or afterwards, the Horſe ſhould diſguſt, or become coſtive, you muſt then give him good <hi>Gliſters</hi> made of two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarts, or <hi>Scots</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins of Milk, and one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pint or <hi>Scots</hi> Mutchkin of <hi>Olive</hi> or <hi>Sallet Oyl,</hi> the whole being well mixed and made Luke warm.</p>
                        <p>Theſe kind of Horſes are never to be <hi>Rid</hi> but with very ſmall <hi>Snaffles,</hi> for fear of hindring their breathing and wind, which one of our great <hi>Bitts</hi> would certainly do; the <hi>Rider</hi> is to lean a little forewards to prevent the wind taking too much upon his Body, and to have alſo Cloaths very light and fit for him, but no flying or looſe coat, only a Cap in place of a Hat, very ſmall and ſharp <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and he is to <hi>Spurr</hi> near to the <hi>Flanks</hi> with little ſtroaks, becauſe ſtrong and great ſtroaks retard a Horſe in ſtead of making him run, no <hi>Curper</hi> nor <hi>Tie</hi> or <hi>Poitral,</hi> only a very light <hi>Saddle,</hi> and the <hi>Rider</hi> ſo too.</p>
                        <p>This is what that <hi>Cavaleer</hi> taught me of the running Horſes in <hi>England,</hi> it is enough to ſatisfie the curioſity of ſuch, who ſhall be deſirous to prepare and dyet Horſes after that manner they practiſe in <hi>England,</hi> for my own part I confeſs, I like better to dreſs a Horſe for the Warr or Mannage, then to prepare him for ſuch <hi>Courſes</hi> where the expences and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are oft times farr greater then either the pleaſure or profit that is got by them.</p>
                        <p>So here endeth the Method of preparing a running Horſe, ſet down by our Author,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179659:208"/>you may chooſe which of the two you will make tryal of, I believe both may be good, but having had experience of the firſt, I can with more confidence recommend it to you then this laſt, and as I have ſet down both, meerly to gratifie a curious Reader, ſo I expect that if any one of them hold, you will not fret and repine at the diſappointment you may meet with from the other ſhould it fail, eſpecially ſeeing you are at liberty to make choice of that, which you ſhall Judge moſt agreeable to reaſon, and the Modern practice of our greateſt <hi>Jockies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In fine to put a cloſe to this <hi>Supplement,</hi> in which I have to my knowledge ommitted nothing material belonging to the Art of Horſemanſhip, I think it will not be amils to conclude it with a few lines, which are in my opinion very appoſite to the ſubject matter of this laſt Chapter; for they were made upon the laſt famous <hi>Horſe-Match,</hi> run before <hi>King CHARLES</hi> the Second of <hi>Bleſſed Memory,</hi> by <hi>Dorſett Ferry</hi> near <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle.</p>

                  <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT BY THE PUBLISHER.</head>
                  <p>LEſt the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhou'd think it ſtrange, why the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Book does not only carry a different Title from the <hi>Firſt,</hi> but is alſo call'd the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> as well as that which is <hi>really</hi> the Firſt; It is thought fit to give him in this place the Reaſon of it; which, in ſhort, is this.</p>
                  <p>About a Year ago it happen'd that the Tranſlation of this excellent Book was undertaken by two different Perſons, the one in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the other in <hi>England,</hi> without either of 'em knowing, or ſo much as in the leaſt ſuſpecting, one another's Deſign; however when they came to underſtand that both of 'em had the ſame Project on Foot, they judg'd it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent not only to communicate their Deſigns to one another, but alſo to diſcover what Progreſs each of 'em had made in it; and it very luckily ſo fell out, that they did not both begin their Tranſlations at one and the ſame Part; but that the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> which was Engliſhed in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Sir <hi>William Hope,</hi> (and which is truly the Firſt Part as the Book came at firſt from <hi>Monſieur Solleyſel</hi>'s own Hands, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee more at large in the <hi>Preface</hi>) happen'd to be that Part which was laſt to be Tranſlated by the Undertaker in <hi>England:</hi> whereupon they judg'd it moſt convenient, both for the ſpeedy publiſhing of ſo uſeful a Book, and to ſave themſelves a great deal of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Trouble and Charges, to join their Tranſlations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thereby to compleat more quickly this Impreſſion, which has been ſo much long'd for.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Reaſon, not only of the two Parts having different Titles, but alſo of both of 'em being call'd the <hi>Firſt.</hi> And as it cannot be deny'd, but that that Part tranſlated in <hi>Scotland</hi> carries the trueſt Title, ſo likewiſe the Title of that
<pb facs="tcp:179659:219"/>done in <hi>England</hi> is made good by the Excellent Collection of <hi>Horſemanſhip,</hi> ſubjoin'd by way of <hi>Supplement</hi> to the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> by Sir <hi>William Hope.</hi> So that, at preſent, by this Addition of his, any Gentleman may be made, by the ſerious Peruſal of this Book, not only a <hi>Skilful</hi> and <hi>Compleat Farrier,</hi> but alſo an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Compleat Horſeman;</hi> which I think makes both the Titles to correſpond abundantly well with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scope and Deſign of the Book, and may ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any Judicious and Candid Reader, who certainly will, or at leaſt ſhould value more the Goodneſs and Excellency of the Matter, than the Omiſſion of a little ſtiff and preciſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in the Form, eſpecially when committed by ſo very unexpected an Accident, as that of the Tranſlation being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at one and the ſame time by Perſons living in different Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>And for the Reader's more eaſie finding out the Chapters and Sections of this <hi>Second Part,</hi> which are quoted in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Tranſlator of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> deſigning to reduce his <hi>Second,</hi> had he gone on with it, into Chapters and Sections, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not done in this Edition of the Second Part, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker in <hi>England</hi> not falling upon that Method; here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows the <hi>Table of Contents,</hi> which mentions the Chapters and Sections, and directs to the Pages where they are to be found; beſides the <hi>Alphabetical Table</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Remedies</hi> at the End, exactly after the ſame Manner as they are quoted in the Firſt Part; which makes this Second Part, although not ſubdivided into Sections, to anſwer altogether as well to the Citations of the Firſt, as if both of 'em had been done by the ſame Hand.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179659:229"/>Learned Phyſicians, I may apply the Words of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to the reſt, <hi>Medicinam vocat omnium Artium nobiliſſimam, ſed propter ignorantiam eorum, qui eam malè exercent, eſſe omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um viliſſimam.</hi> For my part, I can perceive nothing but Vanity and Oſtentation in ſuch pompous Diſcourſes; and all theſe noiſie Preambles do oftentimes end in a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle. Such nice and artful Definitions uſually confound the Author without inſtructing the Reader. A diligent Writer is indeed oblig'd to give a clear Account of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Diſtempers; but after all, the Eye and Experience are ſurer Guides than all the Books that ever were written. I'm perſwaded we ought rather to ſearch after good Medicines, than polite Expreſſions, in oppoſition to thoſe above-mention'd Pretenders to Phyſick, who are very careful to make fine Harangues, but never give themſelves the trouble of enquiring after effectual Remedies. And I dare confidently aſſure the Reader, that if he be well-grounded in the Principles, and proceed with Caution in the Uſe of thoſe Remedies contain'd in this Book, he cannot poſſibly miſs of Succeſs. I have omitted nothing that I thought neceſſary to explain the Nature of Diſeaſes, and without running into uſeleſs Digreſſions concerning the Cauſes of 'em, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſuch Remedies as I have found to be effectual by my own Experience. And ſince we have few Books in our Language, that explain the Manner of Preparing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Medicines, I have endeavour'd with all poſſible Clearneſs, to preſcribe the beſt Methods of Compoſition, and the exact Doſes of my Remedies.</p>
                     <p>This Treatiſe is adapted to all Sorts of Readers: For the Uſe of the Ignorant (or greateſt) part of Mankind, who have not the leaſt Tincture of Learning, or Skill in Phyſick, I have propos'd eaſie and familiar Remedies; And I have alſo frequently confirm'd the Rules of Practice with Reaſons, for the Satisfaction of thoſe who are not unacquainted with the Principles of Art, or have practis'd Phyſick themſelves: neither am I altogether without Hope that the Learned will find ſome Paſſages in it worthy of their ſerious Conſideration. They that know my Profeſſion, or ſhall read this Book, will ſoon perceive that I am neither <hi>Doctor</hi> nor <hi>Phyſician.</hi> Yet ſeveral profeſs'd Phyſicians, or ſuch as aſſume that Title, have pretended that I procur'd ſome Phyſician to compoſe this Treatiſe. But to undeceive theſe Gentlemen, if they ſtill perſiſt in their Errour, I muſt beg leave to tell 'em, that 'tis not impoſſible for an inquiſitive Perſon to underſtand the Theory of Medicine, without pretending to the Practice of it. 'Tis true, I never had the Advantage of a Learned Education, but I have carefully perus'd the beſt Authors, without the Aſſiſtance of which I could neither have diſcover'd new Remedies, nor diſcours'd rationally concerning their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. I muſt indeed confeſs that my Labours are very imperfect; but I dare affirm that ſome of my Remedies will be found upon Trial, to be Good and Methodical, and even applicable to Humane Bodies, by ſuch who know how to proportion their Doſes.</p>
                     <p>Before I enter upon the Subject-Matter of my intended Diſcourſe, it will not be improper to advertiſe the Reader, that if in any part of this Book he ſhall find ſeveral Remedies preſcrib'd for the ſame Diſtemper, he may do me the Juſtice to conclude that I us'd that Method only for his Eaſe and Conveniency. It will perhaps be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that there are ſeveral Perſons who will be puzzl'd to chuſe one among ſo many, and that it was needleſs to mention more than one Approv'd Remedy for every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. I anſwer, in the firſt place, that they are all Good and Approv'd; and we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes find by reaſon of the Variety of Climates, and the different Conſtitutions of Horſes, that the ſame Remedy which has cur'd one, may be unſucceſsfully apply'd to another; ſo that after one Remedy has diſappointed, another will perhaps anſwer our Expectations. Beſides my Deſign is to write for the Uſe of all ſorts of Perſons, and for all Caſes: and ſince there may be occaſion to conſult my Book for the Cure of a Horſe in ſome Country-Village, or in an Army, far from any Druggiſt's Shop, I thought it convenient to preſcribe Choice of Receipts, that in ſuch Caſes my Reader might be able to chuſe a ſimple Remedy that may be prepar'd on the Spot. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there are ſome Compoſitions more difficult than others; and they who are not acquainted with the Art of Mixing Drugs, may uſe ſuch Medicines as are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prepar'd. And, to add one Conſideration more, there are ſome Caſes, in which we muſt begin the Cure of a Diſtemper with one Remedy, and in the Progreſs of it have Recourſe to another, which muſt be again chang'd for a Third, in the Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diſeaſe. Thus you ſee that Variety of Remedies inſtead of being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, is very uſeful and advantageous to thoſe who keep Horſes: for they may chuſe that which pleaſes 'em beſt, or that which may be prepar'd with leaſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, ſince they are all good, tho' ſome of 'em muſt neceſſarily be better than others.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:179659:229"/>
                     <p>To proceed methodically in the Cure of Diſtempers, ſome general Rules muſt be laid down, which we ought always to obſerve. And theſe Rules either reſpect the Subject of the Diſeaſe, the Diſtemper it ſelf, the Remedies that are preſcrib'd, or the Perſon that applies 'em.</p>
                     <p>As for the Subject of the Diſeaſe, or the ſick Horſe, we muſt diligently enquire into his Conſtitution, Age and Strength, together with the Occaſion of his Sickneſs; for there are ſome Horſes, as for Inſtance thoſe that have been manag'd, who are naturally tender and ſqueamiſh. We muſt conſider whether they are too old, or too young, whether their Strength has been exhauſted by hard Labour, or Want of Food; and whether their Diſtempers were occaſion'd by ſome Exceſs: for all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances forbid the Uſe of ſtrong Remedies, or at leaſt require ſmall Doſes; ſince it is not at all convenient to purge and bleed a Horſe, or to torment him with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, when he has only need of Reſt, and good Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, We muſt conſider the Nature of the Diſeaſe that is propos'd to be cur'd. For 'tis equally ridiculous to imagine, that a violent Diſtemper will yield to weak and gentle Remedies, and that every ſlight Indiſpoſition requires powerful and long continu'd Medicines.</p>
                     <p>We muſt never attempt the Cure of a particular Diſtemper, ſo long as the whole Body is out of Order; for it wou'd be in vain to apply Medicines to a ſore Foot, while the Leg and even the whole Habit of the Body is full of bad Humours: Yet ſome Farriers are guilty of this Errour, tho' they might with as probable Hopes of Succeſs, undertake to dry a River without ſtopping its Spring. There are alſo ſome Diſeaſes that obſtruct the Cure of others, and muſt be remov'd before 'em. And beſides we muſt examine, whether there be any Venom or Malignity lurking under the Diſtemper; for the Biting of a mad or venemous Beaſt differs very much from a ſimple Wound.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Remedies that are to be us'd, you muſt obſerve theſe Rules. If you find it neceſſary to proceed to ſome Manual Operation, let it be perform'd dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly; and let all your Drugs be well choſen, exactly prepar'd, and skilfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. You muſt not imagine that the ſcarceſt, deareſt, and moſt operoſe Medicines are the moſt effectual: Deſpiſe not the Herbs that you daily tread under your Feet; but you may juſtly ſuſpect a coſtly Drug. <hi>Gold, Pearls, Precious Stones, Unicorn's Horn,</hi> and <hi>Bezoar,</hi> are often preſcrib'd without any other Effect than the draining of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Purſe. And therefore in Diſeaſes of long continuance we ought to try the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſt, eaſieſt, and cheapeſt Remedies, before we proceed to extremities, as <hi>Arnold de Villa Nova</hi> has well obſerv'd in his <hi>Tratiſe on the Aphoriſms,</hi> where he affirms expreſly, That <hi>'tis a Cheat to uſe Compound Remedies, when Simples are at hand.</hi> Beſides it may be obſerv'd, that when I mention a great Number of Medicines, I do not pretend that none of 'em ought to be omitted; for the Efficacy of a Remedy does not conſiſt in the Multitude of Drugs. Only I thought fit to propoſe a conſiderable number of 'em, that every Man may chuſe ſuch of 'em as he can moſt eaſily procure: but there are ſome particular Compoſitions for dangerous Diſeaſes, in which I wou'd not have the leaſt Circumſtance omitted.</p>
                     <p>'Tis, certainly, a great Happineſs for ſuch as keep Horſes to live near skilful and expert Farriers. In the moſt conſiderable Towns you will always find ſome, on whoſe Skill you may ſecurely depend, and who are able to perform boldly without Preſumption, and certainly without Confuſion, all the Operations that are neceſſary for the Cure of the Diſeaſes mention'd in this Book. But ſince the Conveniency of ſuch skilful Neighbours is not to be found every where, the ſureſt way will be for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man to endeavour after a competent Meaſure of Knowledge in this Art, and to neglect no Opportunities of Inſtruction. And ſince there are ſeveral labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Compoſitions, it will be neceſſary to have Recourſe to an Apothecary, who ought to be faithful in chuſing, skilful in preparing, and reaſonable in ſetting a Price on his Drugs.</p>
                     <p>I am conſident that all thoſe who have any Inclination for Horſes may by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Peruſal of the enſuing Diſcourſe attain to a perfect Knowledge of their Diſeaſes, and be able to cure 'em ſucceſsfully.</p>
                     <p>Before you proceed to cure a ſick Horſe, you muſt labour, in the firſt place, to know the Nature and Cauſes of his Diſtemper. I confeſs 'tis very hard to make an exact Judgment of theſe things in Horſes, who are deſtitute of Reaſon, and the Uſe of Speech. We are, for the moſt part, for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d to depend on bare Conjectures, from which we muſt draw ſuch Inferences as are neceſſary for the Diſcovery of proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179659:230"/>'Tis plain that Experience, Study, and above all, a great deal of Care and Attention are neceſſary Qualifications of a Farrier; ſince the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes that are already ſuppos'd to be known depends on Two Things, the Choice, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Remedies.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be of ſufficient Value to merit a particular Care, you muſt ſtand behind him, and diligently obſerve the leaſt of his Actions, that you may proceed with more Certainty in the Choice of convenient Remedies.</p>
                     <p>The Neglect of this Obſervation is the main Reaſon why the greateſt part of Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have ſo ill Succeſs in the Cure of Internal Diſtempers. 'Tis impoſſible, by a tranſient View of a Horſe, to obſerve whether there is any thing unuſual about him, or to preſcribe ſuitable Remedies, and apply 'em in due time. For even tho' we ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and conſider attentively the very leaſt of his Actions, that we may draw ſome Light from 'em to guide us in our Proceedings, we are frequently apt to fall into Errours notwithſtanding all our Care to prevent 'em, according to that Saying of <hi>Hippocrates, Occaſio praeceps, judicium difficile, experimentum periculoſum.</hi> Daily Experience teaches us, That 'tis very difficult to make a right Judgment of Diſeaſes in Humane Bodies; and how much harder muſt it needs be in the Caſe of Horſes, the Nature of whoſe Diſeaſes is ſo little known, becauſe they have not been ſo carefully ſtudy'd as thoſe of Men; and beſides theſe Animals are not able to diſcover their own Ails.</p>
                     <p>The Practice of Country Farriers is uſually grounded on a Traditional Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Experience from Father to Son, from Maſter to Servant, or from one Companion to another, which, for want of Knowledge and Study, is not always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Succeſs. And thoſe Diſeaſes that might have been cruſh'd in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are oftentimes render'd incurable for want of a timely Diſcovery of their Nature and Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Practitioners paſs for Men of Knowledge, tho' they are acquainted only with External Diſtempers, and Manual Operations, which nevertheleſs they perform after a very indifferent Manner, and are perfect Strangers to the Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Art they profeſs. <hi>Si conſtitutionem ab initio non cognoſcat, &amp; id quod in corpore dominatur, non poterit ea quae animali conducunt offerre.</hi> Theſe Words which I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from <hi>Hippocrates</hi> contain the Sum of what I have ſaid on this Occaſion; and thoſe who underſtand 'em will be of my Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Another Eſſential Reaſon, why even the moſt expert Farriers are frequently unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, is, becauſe they husband their Drugs leſt they ſhou'd not be ſufficiently paid for 'em: For Inſtance, ſuppoſe they ſhou'd give a Remedy to a Horſe to the Value of four or five Shillings, they muſt expect to be laugh'd at for demanding ſuch a Price. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Cordials</hi> that ought to be given in Fevers, which are ſo dear that one ſingle Potion wou'd coſt Six or Eight Shillings. People are not accuſtom'd to ſee ſuch Remedies given, and wou'd refuſe to pay for 'em. And therefore the Farriers make their Drenches with old Drugs, which are to be had at low Rates; and prepare ſuch Cordials as are apt rather to encreaſe than allay the Heat and Inflammation. People are generally pleas'd when they ſee their Horſes void a great deal of Matter, without conſidering the Quality of the Matter that ought to be evacuated; and think their Horſes well purg'd, which is directly oppoſite to the true Method of Cure, if we may give Credit to <hi>Hippocrates, Si talia purgantur qualia purgari oportet, confert, &amp; levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ferant; ſin minus, contra:</hi> But this Errour proceeds rather from Avarice than Want of Skill. Nevertheleſs in all my Practice, I never obſerv'd any Horſes to recover that were ſeiz'd with a continual Fever without any Intermiſſion for Eight and forty Hours, even tho' they were committed to the Care of the moſt Skilful Farriers. For, to ſpeak plainly, Phyſicians themſelves, as well as others, are ſtrangely puzzl'd about the Cure of theſe Fevers; Nature is neither able alone to overcome 'em, nor we to aſſiſt her upon occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I will not pretend to preſcribe a Method for the Cure of continual Fevers, ſince they are not to be conquer'd by the beſt Medicines; yet the ſick Horſe may recover, if the Diſeaſe be nipp'd in the Bud by a Remedy timely adminiſtred, and the Heart be preſerv'd ſound without inflaming it by ſuch Cordials as are uſually given: For Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers are wont to compoſe their Cordials of the moſt common and cheapeſt Drugs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Cordial Powder to 'em, which you will find deſcrib'd in this Book; 'tis too dear, they'll tell ye, and in the mean time they ſuffer the Horſes to periſh. For a Cordial Remedy ſhould ſtrengthen by a Specific Virtue, and not by a fiery Heat; and all Cordials for Horſes ought to be compos'd of Simples that ſtrengthen without Inflammation. The Cordial Waters of <hi>Scorzonera, Carduus Benedictus, Scabious, Roſes,</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:179659:230"/>and other Plants are admirable, for they both moiſten and corroborate; but one Horſe muſt have three Pints of 'em, with ſome good Confection, ſuch as that of <hi>Hyacinth</hi> or <hi>Alkermes,</hi> without either <hi>Musk</hi> or <hi>Amber,</hi> which then are not ſo dear as 'tis commonly believ'd, or with half a Dram of the <hi>Grain</hi> that is us'd in dying <hi>Scarlet,</hi> with the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Zedoary, Contra-yerva, Elecampane, Cubebs,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Eſſence of Vipers</hi> is the Baſis of true Cordials, able to preſerve the Heart from the Venom and extraneous Heat of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fever, and to relieve the ſick Horſe if it be given aſſoon as the Fever appears. Theſe Cordials and Bleeding are the proper Remedies of Fevers, as we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declare when we come to treat of theſe Diſeaſes. I have often obſerv'd that the Feveriſh Heat has been extinguiſh'd by another greater, which being agreeable to Nature, is aſſiſted by her to deſtroy that ſtrange Fire which conſumes her. But this is not applicable to Men, who have a very different Conſtitution from that of theſe Animals.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Theriacal Salt of Vipers</hi> is alſo an Excellent Cordial; and all the Parts of the <hi>Viper</hi> are endu'd with an admirable Vertue to preſerve the Heart of a Horſe from the Malignity caus'd by a Fever. But ſince theſe Remedies ought to act quickly, the moſt excellent Cordials are ſuch as are liquid, or compos'd of <hi>Volatil Salts;</hi> for they penetrate immediately, and exert their Force aſſoon as they are put into the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>I have preſerv'd an infinite Number of Horſes from <hi>Head-Achs</hi> by the Help of a <hi>Mineral</hi> or <hi>Powder,</hi> deſcrib'd in this Book; but there is no certain Remedy for the Cure. For after the Diſeaſe has taken Root, the Cure ſometimes ſucceeds, and ſometimes fails; and never any hitherto cou'd boaſt of an Infallible Remedy in this Caſe, tho' theſe that I have propos'd are very good. But ſince theſe Diſeaſes change, and do not ſtill continue the ſame, we muſt alſo invent new Remedies.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Obſervations concerning the Signs of Sickneſs in a Horſe.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>TO proceed with Succeſs in the Cure of the Diſtempers of Horſes, we muſt not only have a general Idea of their Diſeaſes, but alſo conſider them attentively to diſcover their particular Ails. The firſt Sign that a Horſe gives of his Indiſpoſition is his Loathing his Food; then you muſt obſerve whether he has a wild and hagard Look, for the Eye of a Horſe is, as it were, a Glaſs thro' which you may diſcern the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpoſition of his Body; whether his Ears be cold, his Mouth hot, and foamy or clammy; the Hair on his Flanks rough and ſtaring, and paler than uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ends; his Dung hard, and black or greeniſh; and his Urine clear and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted like Water. There are alſo other Signs which denote Sickneſs; his Eyes weep; his Head is heavy, and hangs down; he is apt to ſtumble as he walks; he is ſlow and dull tho' he was vigorous before; he never troubles other Horſes, contrary to his former Cuſtom; he riſes often and lies down in the Stable, looking towards his Flanks which are doubl'd or folded in; his Heart beats, which may be felt by laying your open Hand between the Shoulder and Sengle on the left Side; he takes no notice of what is done to him; beſides ſeveral other Signs which ſhall be particularly deſcrib'd in their proper places.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe that has been long ſick piſſes without ſtriding, and even without thruſting forth his Yard, letting his Water drop into the Skin or Sheath, it is almoſt always a Sign of Death; unleſs in ſuch Horſes as have the ſame Cuſtom when they are in Health, in which Caſe you muſt draw no Conjectures from this Sign, tho' they continue to piſs after the ſame manner during their Sickneſs.</p>
                     <p>Another no leſs fatal Sign is when the Hair of his Tail and on his Skull may be eaſily pluck'd off.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a dangerous Sign when a ſick Horſe either never lies down, or ſtarts up again immediately, not being able to breathe freely in a lying Poſture; whereas if in the Declination of his Sickneſs he lie down, and continue long in that Poſture, 'tis a very good Sign.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:179659:231"/>
                     <p>When a ſick Horſe turns up the Whites of his Eyes above, you may conclude that he is in Pain, and that his Diſeaſe will be of long continuance.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Signs you may conjecture in the general, that your Horſe is ſick; and afterwards you muſt endeavour to diſcover his particular Diſtemper, that you may be able to apply ſuitable Remedies. A Diſeaſe that is known is half cur'd: <hi>Morbum nôſſe curationis principium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall conſider in Order the Diſeaſes of all the Parts of the Body, beginning with thoſe of the Head, not omitting the leaſt Diſtemper. And in particular I ſhall obſerve this Method. In the <hi>firſt place,</hi> I ſhall propoſe a ſhort Definition of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, with an Account of its Cauſes; and <hi>then,</hi> having deſcrib'd it as clearly and plainly as 'tis poſſible to do on Paper, I ſhall proceed to preſcribe the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Lampas</hi> is a Lump or Excreſcency of Fleſh, about the Bigneſs of a Nut, in the Roof of the Mouth, which riſes above the Teeth, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs. The Horſe endeavouring to eat his Oats feels a Pain in this Part, ſo that he is forc'd to leave off Feeding: Young Horſes are uſually troubl'd with this Diſtemper. Aſſoon as you open their Mouth, you may perceive the Roof of their Mouth to be higher than their Teeth, which we call the <hi>Lampas.</hi> It is cur'd by taking it away with an Inſtrument of Iron made for that Purpoſe, and heated red hot. The leaſt Farrier's Prentice knows how to perform this Operation: but you muſt beware leſt an aukward Operator having made his Iron too hot, after he has cut thro' the Thickneſs of the Excreſcency, ſhou'd by touching it over ſeveral times, burn the Bone: for then the Bone will ſcale, and ſeveral dangerous Conſequences may follow, which muſt be avoided by taking off the <hi>Lampas</hi> at one ſtroak, without coming over the Place again after it is cut off.</p>
                     <p>The Farriers at <hi>Paris</hi> make a Scruple to burn the <hi>Lampas</hi> in young Horſes, ſo long as they have any of their Colt's Teeth: and 'tis my Opinion that this Excreſcency ought not to be taken away till they have put forth all their Teeth, if it does not very much trouble 'em, and hinder 'em from 'eating.</p>

                        <p>You may find a particular deſcription of that which is called the <hi>Tick,</hi> in the Five and Twentieth Chapter of the Second Part. The Remedies that are us'd againſt it do not always ſucceed. Some tie a Leathern Thong of the breadth of three Fingers about the Horſes Neck, near his Head, yet ſo as not to obſtruct his Breath; which makes him either leave off this Cuſtom, or uſe it very little.</p>
                        <p>Others cover the Brims of the Manger with Plates of Braſs or Copper, on which the Horſe is afraid to lean his Teeth, and abſtains from his uſual ſport for ſome time; but there are ſome ſo addicted to that Recreation, that they will not be thus frighted from it.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning it will be ſufficient to rub the brims of the Manger with ſome very bitter Herb, or with Cow's or Dog's Dung. Some cover them with a Sheep's Skin, the woolly ſide outwards, which makes the Horſe deſiſt for ſome time from this Cuſtom.</p>
                        <p>But the ſureſt way is to make him eat in a place where there is no Manger, but only a Rack, and tying him with a Buckle to the Wall, to give him his Oats in a Haver-Sack
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179659:231"/>or Bag which hangs at his Head by a String, ſuch as Troopers uſe in the Army.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen Horſes perfectly cur'd of this ill Cuſtom, by one of theſe means, even after they were eight Years old, and conſequently habituated to it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of</hi> Wolve's Teeth.</head>
                     <p>IN this Diſtemper the <hi>Grinders</hi> grow either outwards or inwards, ſo that when the Horſe feeds, the points of thoſe Teeth that are higher than the reſt, hurt him, by pricking his Fleſh or Tongue and make him give over Eating.</p>
                     <p>This Inconvenience is of no great conſequence, yet it puzzles ſeveral Perſons when they ſee a Horſe forſake his Meat, without any manifeſt cauſe, and pine away when there is no apparent defect either in his Eyes or Hair, and even when he is otherwiſe brisk and lively. You muſt handle his <hi>Grinders,</hi> and if you feel the points of 'em thro' his Lips, take a ſort of <hi>Upſet</hi> of Iron, which Farriers commonly uſe, and ſetting his Mouth open, theſe points will appear, which you may break off with a <hi>Googe,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with which every Farrier is furniſh'd; but you muſt beware leſt by ſtriking heedleſly on the <hi>Googe,</hi> a good Tooth, or even the whole Jaw be looſen'd. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Inconvenience, which may eaſily happen, inſtead of uſing the <hi>Googe,</hi> you may make the Horſe champ on a great <hi>File</hi> us'd by <hi>Lock-ſmiths,</hi> which will break off the overgrown points, if they are not too big: But he muſt chaw the File a quarter of an hour on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>I had once a Mule, one of whoſe <hi>Nether-Grinders</hi> grew to a prodigious length: It happen'd that the upper Tooth, directly oppoſite to it, fell out, and that below grew up into the void ſpace, and by degrees pierc'd the Roof of his Mouth about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ones Finger, which tormented him exceedingly when he drunk. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this Example as an extraordinary caſe, to ſhow that when once the Teeth exceed their due meaſure, and are not daily worn by chewing, they may grow to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary length, and even cut the Roof of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw an old Horſe, one of whoſe great Teeth below was a whole Finger's breadth longer than the reſt of his <hi>Grinders;</hi> we were forc'd to caſt him with a great deal of trouble, before we could break it off with a <hi>Googe,</hi> and his Jaw was ſo looſen'd by the violence of the Operation, that he could not eat without much pain for fifteen days after: But at length he recover'd and fed heartily, which he could not do before that monſtrous Tooth was broken.</p>
                     <p>Young Horſes are as rarely ſubject to this Diſtemper, as they are frequently troubled with the <hi>Lampas:</hi> For the Roof of the Mouth grows lank and dry as the Horſe grows in Age.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve that when you open the Horſes Mouth with the above-mentioned <hi>Upſet,</hi> to take away the <hi>Lampas, Barbs,</hi> or <hi>Wolve's Teeth,</hi> that part of the Inſtrument which reſts upon the nether Jaw muſt be cover'd with ſome old Raggs, to preſerve the Jaw from being hurt by it. I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes whoſe Mouths were ſpoil'd by neglecting ſo neceſſary a precaution.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen the Bit bears too hard upon the Horſe's nether Jaw, whether by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the Rider, or ſome other reaſon, the <hi>Bars</hi> are oftentimes wounded or broken. If the Hurt be ſmall, and the Bone entire, you may rub the part with <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> eight or ten times every day.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bone be broken, and when you touch the Sore with your Finger, if you find a ſharp point or prick, or if there be an <hi>Ulcer</hi> already produc'd, moiſten a little
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179659:232"/>Cotton in <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> which you muſt put into the hole of the Jaw, and while it remains there, hold the Horſe's Tongue with one hand, and with the other keep his Mouth open: For 'tis dangerous to pour the Spirit by drops into the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> leſt ſome of it ſhould fall upon a ſound part, and corrode it alſo. Afterwards rub the Sore every day, with <hi>Honey of Roſes</hi> or common <hi>Honey;</hi> and the Eſcar or Scab will fall off, and the Bone Scale of it ſelf: The Scab being fall'n, anoint the part fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or put Sugar into it till the Sore be heal'd. If there be a hole in the Jaw, accompany'd with Rottenneſs and Stench, which you may know by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Finger into it, without finding a Scale, and by the ſtinking Corruption with which your Finger will be ſmear'd when you pull it out; you muſt fill the hole 3 or 4 times every day with Sugar beaten ſmall, which will quickly cleanſe it, and continue after the ſame manner till the hole be clos'd up, and the Jaw heal'd. But you muſt take care afterwards to put a ſingle <hi>Canon-bit</hi> in the Horſes Mouth, and never to uſe any more the Bit that hurt him, which would ſpoil his Mouth without Remedy. If only the Tongue be hurt, it will quickly heal of it ſelf, without any application, if you change the Bit, and take another that will ſuffer his Tongue to move freely.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it happens that the Bone is ſplit quite downwards under the Fleſh of the Jaw, where Matter gathering corrupts the Bone; and by the provident care of Nature to throw off that putrid Matter, it corrodes the Skin, and cauſes a Tumor or Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to open a paſſage to the Corruption, and diſcharge a part of it. In this caſe you muſt firſt ſearch the depth of the hole with a Probe; for I have ſometimes found that the Probe reach'd into the very Mouth: And then make an Inciſion above the Beard with a Red-hot Knife, reaching downwards, and dividing the Skin to the very Bone; after which put in the Probe again to guide the actual Cautery or Red-hot Iron, with which you muſt touch the Bone ſeveral times, till all the corrupted part of it be throughly burnt. And to haſten the Exfoliation or falling off of the Scales, you muſt anoint the whole burnt part with good <hi>Oyl of Bay,</hi> every ſix hours, for the ſpace of two days.</p>
                     <p>But ſince it is neceſſary that the Horſe ſhould eat to preſerve his Life, the motion of the Jaw, and of the part affected which is very moiſt, will make the Fleſh grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, which, unleſs prevented in time, will ſtop the hole you made in the Jaw, and hinder the Scales from falling off. And therefore you muſt take care to keep the paſſage open, by burning the proud Fleſh with a hot Iron; and even ſometimes the burning muſt be repeated three or four times: or, inſtead of that, you may put Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Sublimate</hi> in the hole over-againſt the Beard where the Fleſh grows too faſt. For on the Bars within the Mouth you muſt only put Sugar into the hole, and the ſcale of the Bars will eaſily fall off: But on the Jaw you will find it very difficult to ſeparate the ſcale that ſhould come out of the hole on the Beard, and this is the part where the Fleſh grows ſo exceſſively. In the laſt place, after the ſcales are fall'n off, you muſt put Sugar beaten ſmall into the hole within the Mouth, and on the Wounds made on the Beard, and afterwards waſh 'em with <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> and <hi>Burnt Allum,</hi> continuing in the ſame manner till the Cure be perfected.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of</hi> Loathing of Food, <hi>or,</hi> Want of Appetite.</head>
                     <p>A Horſe is ſaid to be troubl'd with this Diſtemper, either when he eats leſs than he was wont to do, or eats ſlowly and without Appetite, or when he abſtains from eating any Oats at all. This Diſeaſe may proceed from ſeveral Cauſes, ſome of which are eaſlly known and cur'd, whereas others are uncertain, eſpecially in the beginning of dangerous and doubtful Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall proceed to conſider the various Cauſes of this Diſtemper, with the proper Remedies of each caſe. Some Horſes are naturally ſo nice and ſqueamiſh, that the leaſt bit of Filth, or ſprig of muſty Graſs, which they find among their Oats, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Trifle, or almoſt <hi>nothing</hi> at all, is ſufficient to put 'em out of conceit with their Food. But as they are apt on every ſlight occaſion to forſake their Meat, ſo they eaſily recover their wonted Appetite. This Infirmity proceeds from certain little Worms within the Lips of the Horſes, both above and below, which cauſe ſuch an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179659:232"/>Itching, that they are continually rubbing their Lips againſt the Manger, and without any other Indiſpoſition abſtain from Eating. If you turn back their Lips, the Worms appear like little Lumps or Puſhes.</p>
                     <p>To cure this Diſtemper you muſt cut the uppermoſt Skin within the Lips, in the parts where you ſee the Worms, with a ſharp Knife or Lance, and afterwards rub the Inciſions, and all the Inſide of the Lips with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and the Horſe will quickly recover his Appetite.</p>
                     <p>If you are wholly ignorant of the cauſe that makes your Horſe loath his Food. I am of opinion that 'tis very proper in the Morning to bleed him in the Roof of the Mouth with a ſharp pointed piece of a Hart or Buck's-Horn, or (which produces the ſame effect) with a Lance. The Operation is thus perform'd; find out the middle of the Roof between the two Crocks, or, if it be a Mare, at the third or fourth Furrow of the Mouth, and prick the part with a Lance or piece of Buck's-Horn, either of which mey be us'd without any difficulty: Then give the Horſe two Pecks of <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> to ſtop the Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>If he continue to bleed after he has eat his Bran, draw up his Head with a Halter, as if you were going to give him a <hi>Drench,</hi> and immediately the Bleeding will be ſtop'd.</p>
                     <p>But if after you have kept his Head in that poſture for a conſiderable time, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bleed again as ſoon as you let it down, you may eaſily ſtop the Blood, without raiſing up his Head, by applying an empty <hi>Nut-ſhell</hi> to the Wound: You muſt preſs it on ſomewhat hard, and hold it there for ſome time; after which it will ſtick, and ſtop the Blood more eaſily and effectually than moſt other Remedies. For if I could cure a Horſe with a Trifle, I would preferr that <hi>Trifle</hi> before the moſt precious <hi>Drugs</hi> in both the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This way of <hi>Bleeding</hi> may be us'd on all occaſions, when the nature of the Diſeaſe is uncertain: For it does frequently a great deal of good, and is always innocent.</p>
                     <p>'Tis practis'd ſo univerſally in <hi>Germany,</hi> that moſt Coachmen carry a <hi>Horn</hi> at their Girdle, both becauſe they eſteem it an Ornament, and for the conveniency of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Horſes in the Roof of the Mouth. For as ſoon as a Horſe begins to grow dull and ſtupid, or to forſake his Meat, immediately they prick him with the <hi>Horn,</hi> which (as I have already told you) they carry always about with 'em.</p>
                     <p>But if the Diſtemper will not yield to this Remedy, you muſt make the Horſe champ on a Bit for two Hours, and from time to time take it out of his Mouth, and put it in again. Give him alſo good innocent <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and labour to diſcover the true cauſe of his Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Whatever be the original Cauſe of his Averſion to his Food, and even tho' he be ſick (which happens not unfrequently) you muſt make him chew a Ball ty'd to the Bit, keeping him bridl'd two hours; and aſſoon as you take the Bridle from his Head, he will eat. You will find the Deſcription of the <hi>Ball,</hi> towards the End of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be troubl'd with this Diſtemper, when <hi>Radiſhes</hi> are in Seaſon, which are cry'd about Streets ſo commonly, you muſt make him eat a good quantity of 'em, both Leaves and Roots: for they will reſtore his Appetite, and make him ſtale: 'tis an eaſie Remedy, and grateful to Horſes that ſlight their Food; and the ſame may be ſaid of red <hi>Parſnips</hi> boil'd, which are often very effectual in this Caſe. The Herb <hi>Horſe-Tail,</hi> call'd in Latin <hi>Cauda Equina</hi> or <hi>Equiſetum,</hi> is alſo a good Remedy either dry or green, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a Horſe's Appetite, and to cleanſe his Teeth: It grows in moſt places, and ſerves to ſcour Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Half an Ounce of <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> and as much Powder of <hi>Savin,</hi> put into a Bag, ty'd to the Bit, and left for two hours in the Horſe's Mouth, will cure his Loathing: but the Uſe of this Remedy muſt be repeated every day ſeveral times, and the ſame Bagg will ſerve a long time.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve whether there is not an unuſual Heat in the Horſe's Body, which you may perceive by the Beating or Heaving of his Flanks: if there is not, you may give him an Ounce of <hi>Treacle</hi> well diluted in White or Red Wine, for want of which you may uſe <hi>Orvietan;</hi> for theſe Medicines conſume the Crudities that remain in the Stomach, and reſtore loſt Appetite.</p>
                     <p>If he does not abſtain totally from eating, as we only ſpeak of Horſes that ſlight their Food, ſuppoſing that they eat ſometimes, tho' little and ſlowly; let <hi>Savin</hi> be ſteep'd in Water, and with that moiſten his Oats and Bran, and even his Hay, which will make him feed more heartily. This Method muſt be continu'd for ſome time.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:179659:233"/>
                     <p>The following Remedy is generally known and prepar'd by all ſorts of Perſons; yet ſince I'm reſolv'd to omit nothing that may be of Uſe, I ſhall inſert it here. Take about two Glaſſes of <hi>Verjuice,</hi> or of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> ſeven or eight Heads of <hi>Garlick</hi> bruis'd, about two Ounces of white <hi>Salt,</hi> and half a Pound of <hi>Honey;</hi> Mix 'em in a Pot, and dip the end of a Stick wrapt about with Linen, in this Compoſition, with which you muſt rub his Gums, Lips and Tongue; then take the Bit out of his Mouth, and he will infallibly begin to eat, but if he leave off too ſoon, you muſt repeat the Uſe of the Remedy. Some put <hi>Honey of Roſes</hi> into this Mixture, but <hi>common Honey</hi> is ſufficient, and very effectual.</p>
                     <p>Before you rub his Mouth with this Compoſition, 'tis very convenient to waſh it well with a Sponge dipt in cold Water, to take away the bitter <hi>Foam,</hi> which oftentimes is the main Cauſe of his Averſion to his Meat.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo beat five or ſix Heads of <hi>Garlick</hi> with a little handful of <hi>Salt,</hi> and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em in a Clout to the Bit, leave 'em in his Mouth for the ſpace of half an hour, or a whole hour.</p>
                     <p>I often make uſe of an Ounce of good <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> ty'd to the Bit in a Clout, which I ſuffer him to chew for the Space of two hours; and the Diſeaſe muſt be very inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate if it yields not to this Remedy. Aſſoon as he leaves off eating I put the Bit in his Mouth again, and the ſame <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> will ſerve till it be perfectly diſſolv'd.</p>
                     <p>If after all theſe Remedies the Horſe continue ſtill to ſlight his Food, take a Branch of <hi>Laurel</hi> of an indifferent bigneſs, and put it between his Jaw-Teeth, that he may champ upon it: then rub the Laurel-Branch with <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> or, if that cannot be had, with <hi>common Honey,</hi> and put it into his Mouth; rub it again with Honey, and continue after the ſame manner for the ſpace of half an hour, after which he will certainly begin to eat.</p>
                     <p>A Branch of a <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> will almoſt produce the ſame Effect.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe forſakes his Meat, you muſt leave no Means uneſſay'd to make him eat without Conſtraint: you muſt be often with him, eſpecially if his Averſion proceed from Sickneſs, give him a little <hi>Hay</hi> to eat from your Hand, and if he refuſe to take it, let him ſtand half an hour with a Bit in his Mouth; then take it out again, and offer him ſome Pieces of <hi>Bread,</hi> and if he will not eat, waſh his Mouth with a Sponge, and afterwards give him ſome <hi>Oats</hi> out of your Hand; and, to conclude, uſe all the Ways imaginable to prevent the total Loſs of his Appetite, for which Purpoſe the following <hi>Arman</hi> is of wonderful Efficacy.</p>
                     <p>The ſureſt Remedy that can be us'd is to mix an Ounce of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in fine Powder, with moiſten'd <hi>Bran,</hi> repeating the Doſe twice every Day; for it will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make him eat heartily, and preſerve him in good Health. You will find the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and Compoſition of this Remedy in the 125th. Chapter. You may continue the Uſe of it as long as you pleaſe, without the leaſt ill Conſequence, unleſs when the Horſe has an Inclination to void the <hi>Strangles,</hi> for <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> cools, and in that Caſe hot Remedies are proper.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>TAke a Diſh-full of the Heart of a white Loaf crumbl'd ſmall, moiſten it with <hi>Verjuice,</hi> or for want of that, with <hi>Vinegar;</hi> add a ſufficient qanutity of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes</hi> or if <hi>Violets,</hi> or, if neither of theſe can be had, of common <hi>Honey:</hi> then put the thin Paſte into a Pot, and let it boil over a gentle Fire about a quarter of an hour, till the ſuperfluous moiſture be conſum'd. Afterwards add two drams of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> in powder, a dozen and a half of <hi>Cloves,</hi> a <hi>Nutmeg</hi> grated, and half a pound of <hi>Powder-Sugar;</hi> then boil 'em again over a ſlow Fire half a quarter of an hour, that the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients may be thorowly mix'd, and the Spices may incorporate with the Bread: but the Fire muſt be very ſmall, for the leaſt exceſs of heat wou'd make the Virtue of the <hi>Aromatic</hi> Drugs exhale.</p>
                     <p>Take an Oxe's Pizzle, let the great End of it ſoak in Water four or five hours till it be ſoften'd, after which make the Horſe chew it between his Grinders or Jaw-Teeth, which will flatten it a little, or you may beat it with a Hammer: then putting the quantity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179659:233"/>of a Nut of the <hi>Arman</hi> upon it, open the Horſe's Mouth, making him put out his Tongue on one ſide that he may not be able to ſtir it, and thruſt in the Pizzle with the Medicine as far as you can: then let his Tongue go, and after he has champ'd a while, put more of the <hi>Arman</hi> on the Pizzle, and thruſt it again into his Mouth. Do this five or ſix times, and after the ſpace of three hours ſuffer him to eat if he pleaſes: then put in the Pizzle again as formerly, and continue after the ſame manner every three hours.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Arman</hi> is very proper for all Horſes that are ſick and forſake their Meat, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they have no Fever, and I have always found it effectual: for it nouriſhes, and infallibly reſtores loſt Appetite. You muſt not thruſt in the Pizzle violently, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Horſe to draw it in to the bottom of his Throat, holding it by the other end: and it will make him caſt forth a great deal of bitter and cholerick Flegm which makes him loath his Food. As often as you take out the Pizzle you muſt cleanſe it and wipe it with Hay, before you put it in again.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy is not the leſs valuable becauſe 'tis common; for if the Uſe of it be continu'd, it will certainly produce the deſir'd Effect; it nouriſhes, encreaſes the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſtrengthens the natural Heat.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo good to clear the Throat of a Horſe that has ſwallow'd a Feather, or any other Matter that ſticks in his Throat; for which purpoſe you muſt ſuffer him to chew the Pizzle with the Medicine, and ſuck it in, without thruſting it violently forwards. To conclude, this is a very ſafe Remedy, and is never attended with any ill Conſequences: but if the Pizzle be not ſoften'd, or if you thruſt it in violently, you may kill the Horſe by burſting his Throat; which Misfortune may be eaſily prevented by a careful Obſervance of the above-mention'd Directions, the neglect of which has, to my Knowledge, been fatal to ſome Horſes.</p>

                     <p>THere cannot be a greater Vexation to a Man who loves his Horſes, than to ſee 'em loſe their Appetite, and forſake their Meat on a Journey. Accidents of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are very common, and the uſual Remedies that are preſcrib'd in this Caſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; nor could I ever meet with any ſure Medicine but this, which I have try'd ſo often, and with ſo good Succeſs, that I thought my ſelf oblig'd not to deprive the Publick of the Knowledge of ſo uſeful a Remedy, not only for Horſes that are troubl'd with Want of Appetite without any other Diſtemper, but even when this Symptom proceeds from another Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Balls</hi> bring forth that ſalt Humour and bitter Phlegm which obſtruct the Paſſages of the Throat, and make 'em loath their Food.

                     <p>Take a Pound of <hi>Aſſa foetida,</hi> as much <hi>Liver of Antimony.</hi> half a pound of the <hi>Wood</hi> of a <hi>Bay-Tree,</hi> an equal quantity of <hi>Juniper-Wood,</hi> and two ounces of <hi>Pellitory</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> beat all the Ingredients apart, to a groſs Powder, for which reaſon the Woods muſt be dry'd, then put 'em all together into a large Mortar, and incorporate 'em with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of good <hi>Grape-Verjuice</hi> well clarify'd, pouring it in by degrees, till they are reduc'd to a Maſs, of which make <hi>Balls</hi> of the weight of an ounce and a half, to be dry'd in the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Take one of theſe <hi>Balls,</hi> wrap it in a Linen Clout, and tying a Thread to it, make the Horſe chew it two hours in the Morning; and he will eat aſſoon as you unbridle him: Do the ſame at Night, and perſiſt in this Method till the Horſe recover his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. When one <hi>Ball</hi> is conſum'd put in another.</p>
                     <p>You may uſe theſe <hi>Balls</hi> on the Road, by tying one of 'em to the Bridle: and you muſt perſiſt in the Uſe of 'em till the Horſe begin to feed heartily, which he will quickly do, if he be not troubl'd with ſome other Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo make uſe of <hi>Cordial-Pills</hi> made of <hi>Treacle,</hi> which produce almoſt the ſame Effect. You muſt tie 'em in a Clout to the Bit, and make the Horſe chew 'em two hours in the Morning, and as long in the Afternoon; and aſſoon as the Bit is taken
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179659:234"/>out, he will infallibly begin to eat, and his Appetite will encreaſe by degrees, if the uſe of the Remedy be continu'd.</p>

                        <p>Theſe <hi>Pills</hi> are good to make Horſes eat, but they muſt be ſwallow'd down, whereas the former <hi>Pills</hi> are only order'd to be chew'd. The above-mentioned <hi>Balls</hi> are proper for all ſorts of Horſes; but theſe <hi>Pills</hi> muſt not be given to a Horſe that is either actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> or inclin'd to 'em, becauſe they are not hot.

                        <p>The <hi>Pills</hi> are thus prepar'd; Take a pound of <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> beaten to a very fine Powder, and with the <hi>Mucilage,</hi> or thick and ſlimy ſolution of <hi>Gum Tragacanth,</hi> make <hi>Pills</hi> or <hi>Balls</hi> each weighing ten drams, and lay 'em to dry.</p>

The application of theſe Rules to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes would require an account of all the Diſeaſes to which Horſes are ſubject, and therefore I ſhall at preſent content my ſelf with laying down this general Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that when a Horſe abſtains obſtinately from all manner of Food, you muſt uſe all means that are not contrary to his Diſtemper to make him eat, leſt you be forc'd at laſt to have recourſe to violent Methods, ſuch as the uſual way of pouring in his neceſſary Suſtenance with a Horn, which cannot be done without drawing up his Head with a Halter, and putting him into a very uneaſie poſture, which hinders him from breathing freely, and increaſes the Fever when he has any. I confeſs you may make him ſwallow a Draught without uſing the Halter; but even that cannot be done without expoſing him in ſome meaſure to the ſame Inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p>I cannot approve the Method of thoſe who if a Horſe abſtain from eating for the ſpace of twelve or fifteen hours, and even tho' he be ſeiz'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> immediately give him a Quart or two of <hi>Milk</hi> with <hi>Yolks of Eggs,</hi> which they imagine is ſufficient to prevent all the ill effects of his preceding Abſtinence. But beſides that, a Horſe may be ſuffer'd to faſt two days without any danger; this ſort of Nouriſhment is not at all agreeable to his Stomach, and even is apt to make him Sick, tho' he was not ſo before: 'Tis true <hi>Milk</hi> yields good Nouriſhment, and is eaſily digeſted; but 'tis ſubject to the common Inconveniency of the beſt Aliments, that it quickly corrupts in a diſorder'd Stomach, where it curdles and occaſions violent Pains, and if it be not caſt forth at the Mouth (which a Horſe cannot do, ſince he never Vomits) it hardens, and produces dangerous Obſtructions. So that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had reaſon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the uſe of it in Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head, Fevers,</hi> and ſome other caſes, tho' he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it on certain occaſions. <hi>Lac dare capite dolentibus malum, malum etiam febricitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi> If that famous Author thought it inconvenient for Men who are accuſtom'd to it, and can diſcharge it by Vomiting, how prejudicial muſt it be to Horſes, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſte a drop of it after they leave off Sucking, and beſides cannot Vomit? I have made ſome Trials of it, but always without the leaſt Succeſs, eſpecially when the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179659:234"/>Horſes were Feveriſh. <hi>In Stomacho aegrotantium Animalium aceſſit lac, ſed non imprimitur vitali Caraciere, propterca aciditas fit putrefactiva, quae non nutrit, ſed malum auget.</hi> Thoſe who will not be diſſwaded by theſe Reaſons fromfeeding their Sick Horſes with Milk, may blame their own Indiſcretion for the ill ſucceſs of the Cure. For, let a Perſon who is in Health drink a Glaſs of Milk faſting, and immediately Vomit it up again, as ſome can do without the leaſt difficulty, he will find that tis already become ſowre, and even half coagulated, or turn'd to Chooſe, by reaſon of the Acid or Sharp Juice in the Stomach of all ſorts of Animals: For 'tis a vulgar Obſervation that Acids have a power to curdle or coagulate Milk, which therefore cannot be agreeable to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of a Sick Horſe, where it preſently turns to Corruption, and inſtead of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing him, encreaſes his Diſeaſe. 'Tis true, this Experiment cannot be made upon a Horſe who never Vomits, but it may ſerve for a convincing Argument, that Milk is rather hurtful than profitable to a Diſeas'd Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Some give their Horſes ſtrong <hi>Fleſh-Broths</hi> or <hi>Jellies,</hi> which I have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be very prejudicial to 'em; for it would be more proper to give em <hi>Extracts</hi> of <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Oats,</hi> which are their uſual Food. The dangerouſneſs of this Method will appear more evidently, if we confider that Horſes have ſo ſtrong an avernon to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Broths</hi> are apter to <hi>deſtroy</hi> than to <hi>reſtore</hi> their Appetites: And all the World knows that if the Teeth of a Horſe, who is in perfect Health, be rubb'd with <hi>Fat</hi> or <hi>Suet,</hi> he will forſake his Meat, much more when he is actually Sick.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that the <hi>Fat</hi> may be taken away from <hi>Broath;</hi> but ſtill 'tis plain that any ſort of <hi>Broth</hi> is nauſeous to a Horſe, and diſagreeable to his Stomach, and therefore ought never to be given, ſince there are other Aliments which are more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and in all reſpects more convenient.</p>
                     <p>I commend a very thin <hi>Broath</hi> made of <hi>Bread,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Crum,</hi> boil'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a little Salt; for 'tis certainly very proper Nouriſhment for a Horſe that will neither eat Hay, Oats, nor Bran. I have ſeen ſome Horſes drink this Liquor like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which nouriſh'd 'em for a conſiderable time; and if they ſhould happen to loath it, you may force it down their Throats with a Horn, for a very little quantity will ſerve to ſuſtain 'em.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo feed the Sick Horſe with a Broth or Liquor, which is both cheap and eaſily prepared, and beſides, is of the ſame nature with his uſual Nouriſhment. 'Tis made of <hi>Oats</hi> or cleans'd <hi>Barley</hi> well boil'd in pure Water, without <hi>Butter, Fat,</hi> or any other mixture; you muſt ſtrain the Liquor from the <hi>Grains,</hi> and give it him luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm. It differs from his ordinary Food only by the boiling of the <hi>Oats</hi> or <hi>Barley,</hi> which cannot make it prejudicial to a Stomach that is weaken'd by the continuance of a Diſeaſe. This Method ſeems to be founded on Reaſon, and agreeable to the dictates of good ſence: And experience will diſcover its uſefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Take a pound of <hi>Barley-flower,</hi> well fears'd and purifi'd from the Bran; boil it in about two pints of Water to a ſufficient thickneſs, then take it from the Fire, and add a quarter of a pound of <hi>Sugar.</hi> The quantity of <hi>Broth</hi> here preſcrib'd is ſufficient to ſuſtain a Horſe four and twenty Hours, and muſt be given with a Horn. It moiſtens the Body when dry'd by a Feveriſh heat or any other cauſe; but if the <hi>Fever</hi> be very gentle, and the want of Appetite proceed from ſome other Cauſe, you may add to the Broth an Ounce of the <hi>Cordial-Powder</hi> hereafter deſcrib'd, which will contribute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to the recovery of his Appetite: Or you may mix with the Broth an Ounce of <hi>Ever of Antimony</hi> in Powder, which will make him Hungry, and allay the preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of his Entrails.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is troubl'd with a <hi>Fever, Palpitation,</hi> or unuſual beating of the <hi>Heart,</hi> or any other hot or violent Diſeaſes which ſeldom continue long; you muſt be careful in proportioning the quantity of his Food, and neither give nor ſuffer him to eat too much. Exceſſive Eating has, to my certain knowledge, prov'd fatal to ſeveral Horſes, who might have eſcap'd, if they had been kept to a convenient, that is, a thin and ſpare Diet. A great quantity of <hi>Hay</hi> is very hurtful to Sick Horſes; and Straw is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it can be had. 'Tis certain, that in thoſe Diſeaſes that are of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, few or no Horſes die of <hi>Hunger,</hi> whereas a great number of 'em are kill'd by <hi>exceſſive Eating.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you are forc'd to give the Horſe his Food with a Horn, you muſt proceed in that method according to his ſtrength and ſize. But if he eat without conſtraint, as it happens frequently by vertue of the prepar'd <hi>Antimony</hi> mixt with his Bran, which gives him an Appetite, you muſt keep him to a ſtrict Diet: For when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat is wholly taken up in the Digeſtion and Concoction of Aliments, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,

                     <p>I recommend a ſtrict Diet only in violent Diſtempers, which are not of any long continuance; for when the Diſeaſe laſts long, you muſt take other Meaſures, and feed the Horſe, leſt the preternatural Heat ſhould be augmented, and the body of the Horſe ſo dry'd, that you cou'd not afterwards reſtore him to his wonted Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The Rules here laid down for the Nouriſhment of Sick Horſes ſhall not be repeated afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Before I engage further in the deſcription of Remedies, it will not be improper to admoniſh thoſe who are Lovers of Horſes, to beware of being Cheated by thoſe deceitful Praiſes that are given to the Remedies commonly call'd <hi>Secrets.</hi> The cuſtom of extolling Remedies is grown ſo general, that 'tis very hard to perceive whether thoſe who magnifie 'em ſo extremely, act out of a principle of Juſtice, or are ſway'd by a vain deſire to make a Figure in the World, and to perſwade the Publick that they are Maſters of ſome rare and extraordinary Medicines. You may obſerve, that they who are deſirous to gain Credit to their Remedies, will at leaſt aſſure you that they are admirable, and that they cure all thoſe who uſe 'em: You muſt not ſeem to doubt of their Infallibility, tho' in all their Deſcriptions you can neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Method, Regularity of Doſes, nor the leaſt appearance of Reaſon, but muſt blindly believe that thoſe rare <hi>Secrets</hi> have perform'd innumerable Cures. I adviſe you not to ſuffer your ſelf to be bubbl'd by ſuch ill grounded Praiſes: For experience will convince you, that they who have good Remedies never impart 'em but after long and earneſt Solicitations, and only to their beſt Friends. My deſign is not by diſcrediting others, to recommend my own Remedies; I only deſire you to communicate 'em to Judicious and Learned Perſons, and after you have heard their Opinion of 'em, to try, and value 'em according to their Succeſs. In the mean time I aſſure you that you have in this Book the Summ of above <hi>Forty Years</hi> Labour and Experience, during which time I have been ſtill endeavouring to find out and make trial of the beſt Remedies for Horſes; I have carefully perus'd all the Books that treat of this Subject, conſulted Learned Men to reſolve my Doubts, ſtudied the various Effects of Simples, and try'd the Vertue of 'em not once but a hundred times.</p>
                     <p>I have made <hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Alterations</hi> according to the various Succeſs I have had in my Practice, and without deſiring in the leaſt to magnifie my Skill, I can aſſure you that the greateſt part of the Remedies here communicated to the Publick, are of my own Invention, and all of 'em compos'd Methodically, and grounded on Reaſon. Beſides, I have freely imparted all that I know, without concealing any thing, that the Publick may enjoy the fruit of my Labour. Before I was Maſter of that little Knowledge which Time and Experience have taught me, I eſteem'd the Remedies which I found to be effectual, ſo precious, and kept 'em ſo ſecret, that I communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em to very few; but I have ſince overcome all thoſe Prejudices. For 'tis certain, that thoſe who excel in any Art are never jealous of the reſt of their Profeſſion; whereas common Artiſts and half Proficients cannot endure to hear any Man prais'd but themſelves; and far from doing Juſtice to the Merit of others, they imagine that every acknowledgment of the Skill of their Fellow-Profeſſors is a diminution of their own Glory. I pretend no right to the Title of <hi>Learned;</hi> but I cannot forbear expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my ſatisfaction to perceive that the favourable reception of this Treatiſe has ſtirr'd up the Indignation of ſome Perſons who would be thought skilful.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as it appear'd, it was receiv'd by moſt <hi>Farriers</hi> with furious Exclamations againſt the Method I preſcrib'd for the Cure of the Diſeaſes incident to Horſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did not think fit to follow their thread-bare way of Practice. Since that time ſeveral Perſons of Quality, who put ſome confidence in my Experience, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Farriers to obſerve my Directions punctually, they found 'em to be ſucceſsful on a thouſand Occaſions: They yielded at laſt to the evidence of Truth, and by degrees began to read my Book, which cur'd 'em of ſome of their old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and convinc'd almoſt all of 'em, one after another: Inſomuch that within theſe fifteen or ſixteen Years the Method of curing Horſes is almoſt wholly chang'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Farriers come daily to ask my advice concerning the Sick Horſes that are committed to their care, by which means they ſatisfie their Cuſtomers, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all read my Book, and will have their Farriers to obſerve exactly the Method that is preſcrib'd in it, when their Horſes are ſeiz'd with any Diſtemper. If things continue in this poſture, as according to all probability they will, the Art which we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179659:236"/>profeſs, will in a little time be very much improv'd, and attended with better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than it was heretofore. So important an Effect is already owing in a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure to this Book, which ought to recommend it very advantageouſly to the Publick.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the</hi> Strangles.</head>
                     <p>FEW or nor Horſes that are foal'd in this Country eſcape being troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> which is a Throwing forth or Evacuation of ſuperfluous Humours ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd in the Bodies of Foals, either according to the uſual Method of Nature thro the Noſtrils, or by Swellings or Boils under the Throat between the two Jaw-bones. They ſeem to differ from the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> in Children, only with reſpect to the Place where the Humours are expell'd.</p>
                     <p>I know there are various Opinions concerning the Cauſe of this Diſtemper: For ſome look for its Original in the Mare's Womb, from whence (they think) the Foal brings the Seeds of it, which ſome Years after, when the natural Heat is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably augmented, break forth, and agitate the Humours, which by degrees are diſcharg'd on ſome part of the Body, where they uſually come to Suppuration. Others are of Opinion that the Change of Nouriſhment, that is, of Milk to more ſolid Food, makes a notable Alteration in the Body, both in the Humours, and in the Parts that are nouriſh'd by 'em, which is follow'd by a Fermentation, that obliges Nature to make an Attempt to expel the Remainders of the firſt Nouriſhment, which ſerve for a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Diſtemper. And in the laſt place there are ſome who believe that all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors have their peculiar times of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> as Wine, Beer, Cyder, and Syrups boil, caſt forth a Scum, and are purify'd, ſome ſooner, and others later, according to the various Conſtitutions of the Liquors; and from hence they infer that the Blood of Animals has different times of Purification, for which reaſon Men are ſeiz'd with the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> at diverſe Periods of their Age, but there not being the ſame Variety in the Conſtitution of Horſes, they are uſually troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles</hi> about the <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>Fourth</hi> Year of their Age. But the Conſideration of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Diſtemper is of no great Importance for the <hi>Cure:</hi> and 'tis much more neceſſary to know the way by which Nature expels the Humour, which, as I intimated before, is oftentimes evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Swellings under the Throat, or by the Noſtrils. Sometimes the Horſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Humour viſibly by theſe Boils; whereas it happens not unfrequently that the Swellings are never ripen'd, the Humour being reſolv'd, and inſenſibly tranſpiring thro' the Skin. But the Cure is always moſt certain, when the Swellings come to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Humour is evacuated by ſeveral Parts of the Body, as the Shoulders, Hams, the Parts above the Kidneys, the Feet, and generally whatſoever Member is weaker than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus 'tis voided by ſuch Parts as have been hurt or wounded: for when Nature is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated by her Enemy ſhe makes an Attempt to drive it out; and 'tis certain that the ſtronger Parts caſt their Load on the weaker. But if the Part that receives the Humour be either cold, nervous, or of ſmall Capacity, 'tis never able wholly to diſcharge its unequal Burthen, but ever afterwards remains weak and infirm.</p>
                     <p>When there is only an imperfect Evacuation of the Humour, the Horſe is frequently troubld with <hi>Falſe-Strangles</hi> at the Age of Six, Ten, or Twelve Years; which being neglected degenerates to the <hi>Glanders.</hi> When the <hi>Falſe-Strangles</hi> take their Courſe thro' the Noſe (which rarely happens) the Horſe is much more troubl'd with Sickneſs, than when they find another Paſſage: And in the general 'tis certainly the beſt and ſaſeſt Evacuation that is perform'd by the Kernels or Swellings under the Throat, for when they are open'd the Horſe is out of danger, and even thoſe who void the Humor by the Noſe, are very much eas'd by 'em.</p>
                     <p>The moſt favourable time for Horſes to be ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper, is when they are <hi>Foals,</hi> and run in the Meadows; for their Heads being continually bow'd down to feed on the Graſs, the Evacuation is perform'd with leſs Trouble and Pain; and beſides <hi>Graſs</hi> being a moiſt Aliment, increaſes the Fluidity of the Humours, and by making
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179659:237"/>'em run out more eaſily, haſtens the Cure. But you muſt not conclude from hence that <hi>Graſs</hi> is good for this Diſtemper: the <hi>Strangles</hi> require <hi>hot</hi> Medicines, and <hi>Graſs</hi> is <hi>cooling;</hi> but the Foals that are troubl'd with 'em in the Meadows have a ſufficient Stock of natural Heat and Strength to expel the Humour; and therefore they do not ſtand in need of additional Supplies of Heat, ſince notwithſtanding the Coolneſs of the <hi>Graſs,</hi> they are able of themſelves to conquer the Diſeaſe. But Horſes that are us'd to dry Food muſt not be turn'd out to Graſs, which wou'd cool 'em too much, and perhaps turn the <hi>Strangles</hi> to the <hi>Glanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>None of all the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors, who write of the Diſeaſes of Horſes, take notice of the <hi>Strangles:</hi> and 'tis very improbable that <hi>le Ruiny,</hi> who has deſcrib'd all their other Diſtempers ſo exactly, wou'd have omitted this, if he had known it. But in thoſe <hi>Southern</hi> Countries the Horſes are either never troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Humour by the way of inſenſible Tranſpiration. <hi>Paſcal Caracciolo</hi> does not mention this Diſtemper in his large and excellent Treatiſe, Entitled, <hi>Gloria del Cavallo,</hi> which deſerves to be tranſlated by ſome skilful Hand: And therefore I think my ſelf oblig'd to inſiſt the longer on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Bearn,</hi> where the Climate is hot, and approaches to that of <hi>Spain,</hi> almoſt all the Horſes die of the <hi>Strangles;</hi> for by reaſon of the Imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Evacuation, the Diſeaſe ends either in Blindneſs or Death; and I have ſeen ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes at <hi>Paris,</hi> who were ſeiz'd with Blindneſs, becauſe they had not voided the Humour that cauſes the <hi>Strangles.</hi> To return to <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is not hot enough to reſolve the Humour, and diſſipate it entirely; and therefore ſince it ought to be expell'd by more open Paſſages, the Horſes diſcharge it imperfectly and out of ſeaſon; and if they be not powerfully aſſiſted, the leaſt dammage they receive by the Diſeaſe is the Loſs of their Eyes. But in this Country we are not afraid of ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for our own Horſes, becauſe of the Temperateneſs of the Climate, which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles 'em to expel the Humour without any difficulty. This difference might be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a common Obſervation, for 'tis well known that at <hi>Paris</hi> Blows on the <hi>Head</hi> are not at all dangerous, and Sores in the <hi>Legs</hi> are rarely cur'd; whereas a quite contrary Effect is obſerv'd in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc.</hi>

                        <p>If the Horſe void the Humour ſufficiently by the Noſe, you muſt not diſturb Nature by endeavouring to aſſiſt her; only keep the Horſe warm, and walk him every Morning and Evening: for there is no Danger after the Paſſage is open'd. But if his Noſe be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by hard or dry Matter, ſo that he can neither breathe freely, nor expel the Humour without Pain: you muſt inject into his Noſtrils, with a ſmall Syringe, a warm Liquor made of equal parts of <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> and <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> ſhaken together, which will looſen the <hi>Flegmatic</hi> Humour that ſtops the Paſſages, and help Nature to throw it out You will find great Benefit by the repeated Uſe of this eaſie Remedy.</p>
                        <p>If the Matter be evacuated in too ſmall a Quantity, and Nature ſeem to be languid; you muſt endeavour to warm the Horſe's Body with <hi>Cordial Pills,</hi> the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi> or the <hi>Electuary of Kermes;</hi> or you may give him ſome Doſes of the <hi>Lieutenant's Powder,</hi> deſcrib'd in the Second Part: Or if none of theſe Medicines can be had, you may give him every Morning half an Ounce of <hi>Treacle</hi> mix'd with a Pint of <hi>Spaniſh Wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A large Quantity of the Herb <hi>Periwinkle</hi> chopp'd ſmall and mix'd with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> will make the Horſe void the Humour plentifully.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards you may put <hi>Feathers</hi> into his Noſe, in this manner. Take two large <hi>Gooſe-Quills,</hi> of thoſe that grow in the middle of the Wing, anoint 'em with freſh <hi>Butter</hi> melted in a Plate, and aſſoon as they are cold, ſprinkle the Ends of 'em with a little Powder of <hi>Pepper</hi> or of <hi>Tabacco:</hi> then thruſt 'em up into the Horſe's Noſtrils, and to keep 'em from falling out, tye a ſtrong Thread to the great Ends of the Quills, and faſten it to the Halter, leaving him in that Poſture with a Bit in his Mouth for the ſpace of two hours. This muſt be done two days, and on the third you muſt ſprinkle the Ends of the Quills with Powder of <hi>white Hellebore,</hi> continuing after the ſame manner till all the Matter be evacuated.</p>
                        <p>It will be convenient to repeat the uſe of the <hi>Cordial Pills,</hi> or <hi>Powder,</hi> or the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's Powder,</hi> as often as there ſhall be occaſion: or you may uſe the following <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Diſeaſe is ſtubborn, you muſt ſyringe the Horſe's Noſtrils from time to time.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Electuary of Kermes</hi> is of excellent Uſe in this Caſe, and corrects the Corruption and Stench of the Matter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the</hi> Electuary of Kermes</head>
                     <p>THis <hi>Electuary</hi> wou'd be in all reſpects as noble a Remedy for Horſes, as the <hi>Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Alkermes,</hi> if inſtead of the dry Grains of <hi>Kermes,</hi> which are properly nothing elſe but the Bark, Farriers wou'd make uſe of the true and precious Pith or Pulp en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd in 'em, which is firſt a liquid Subſtance, but when it grows ripe, is reduc'd, without any artificial Preparation, to a very red Powder, which falls of it ſelf out of the Hole in its Bark or Cover, on that Side where it ſticks to the Wood or Leaf of a Shrub call'd the <hi>Scarlet-Oak,</hi> on which it grows. Aſſoon as this Powder begins to be animated, and to turn to little Worms of the ſame Colour, you muſt quench it with <hi>Juice of Limons</hi> rectifi'd and ſeparated from its Phlegm to the Conſumption of a fourth part; then knead it, and make it up into little <hi>Troches,</hi> which muſt be dry'd. Thus prepar'd 'tis much better than its Bark, which is brought to us from <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Take four Ounces of theſe <hi>Troches,</hi> if they can be had, or if you have only the <hi>Grains,</hi> take a Pound of the freſheſt and faireſt of 'em, tho' dry; half a Pound of <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> ripe and dry; <hi>Cubebs,</hi> and <hi>Bay-Berries,</hi> of each ſix Ounces; <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Spaniſh Scorzonera, Maſter-Wort, Zedoary, Flower-de-luce</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Shavings</hi> of <hi>Hart's-Horn</hi> and <hi>Ivory,</hi> of each four Ounces and a half; <hi>Elecampane-Roots, Bark</hi> of <hi>Oranges</hi> and <hi>Citrons</hi> dry'd in the ſhade, of each four Ounces; <hi>Cinnamon</hi> half an Ounce; <hi>Cloves</hi> and <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> of each two Drams.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:179659:238"/>
                     <p>All the Ingredients muſt be reduc'd to a fine Powder, ſears'd, and then weigh'd; if you take the full Doſes of each, the weight of all together will amount to three Pounds ten Ounces, and two Drams of Powder. Then take eleven Pounds of clarifi'd <hi>Honey,</hi> and boil it to half the thickneſs of a <hi>Syrup;</hi> after which take the Veſſel from the Fire, and while the <hi>Honey</hi> is yet hot, pour in the Powders by degrees, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate 'em throughly together. You muſt ſuffer the <hi>Electuary</hi> to ferment two Months in a Pot before you give it to the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doſe</hi> is a quarter of Pound in a Quart of White-Wine, or two Ounces in a pint of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Wine. It muſt be Infus'd over Night, and next Morning given to the Horſe, who muſt ſtand Bridled two Hours before, and as long after.</p>
                     <p>'Tho' this <hi>Electuary</hi> is compos'd of the ſame Drugs that are us'd in the preparations of <hi>Cordial Powders,</hi> it will be found to be more effectual; becauſe the <hi>Fermentation</hi> exalts the vertue of its Ingredients, and the <hi>Honey</hi> being impregnated with their <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> communicates it to the Stomach, Lungs, and Heart, and from thence to all the parts of the Body. Thus 'tis plain that this Medicine operates more vigorouſly and quickly than <hi>Cordial Powders,</hi> ſince 'tis prepar'd by the ſucceeding <hi>Fermentation,</hi> before it enters into the Stomach. <hi>Avicen</hi> makes a long diſcourſe to prove the uſefulneſs of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> which he confirms by the example of <hi>Treacle,</hi> demonſtrating that the Fermentation that ſucceeds the Compoſition of that Remedy produces a certain Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Vertue out of an infinite number of Simples, which can only be attributed to the digeſtion of the Ingredients; <hi>Ait enim duplicatae eſſe virtutis Medicinam, quae fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentationem ſit paſſa.</hi> The ſame effect appears evidently in natural Productions; for <hi>Muſt</hi> by Fermentation is chang'd to <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> boil'd with Barley and Hops turns to <hi>Beer,</hi> from whence a burning Spirit is drawn: And for the ſame reaſon <hi>Bread</hi> would be very unwholſome if it were not leaven'd, for 'tis only <hi>Fermentation</hi> that makes it light and agreeable to the Taſte. The mixture and variety of Ingredients is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to produce Fermentation, as it appears plainly in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which never fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone, but if it be mixt with a little <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> the Particles of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor do immediately aſcend with a great deal of Impetuoſity, and make a conſidereble Ebullition; for by vertue of the two Principles which cauſe that remarkable Digeſtion, the ſubtle Particles being mixt with thoſe that are groſſer, dilate 'em, and produce that Fermentation, which is admirably well explain'd by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> a famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Electuary</hi> is good for <hi>Defluxions, Colds, Palpitation of the Heart, Loſs of Appetite, Dulneſs</hi> and <hi>Leaneſs</hi> of Horſes; and beſides it may be given for Preſervation; for it ſtrengthens Nature, and helps her to expel by the uſual Paſſages, every thing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her, and that is apt to degenerate to Corruption.</p>
                     <p>You need not be afraid of the <hi>Heat</hi> of this Remedy; for ſuch <hi>Cordials</hi> as this never inflame the parts of the Body, and by the help of this <hi>Electuary</hi> you may ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume corrupt and offending Humors, than by <hi>Purgation,</hi> which oppreſſes Nature, and diſorders the Body of a Horſe. 'Tis true, it does not operate ſo quickly, but 'tis more innocent; for whereas Nature is weaken'd by Purgation, ſhe is powerfully aſſiſted and envigorated by this Remedy to expel noxious Humors, and the ſick Horſes grows luſty and fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>A Doſe of this Medicine may be ſeveral times repeated, as well as of the other <hi>Cordials</hi> that ſhall be deſcrib'd; and you may alſo give the following <hi>Balls</hi> to the ſick Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Butter,</hi> the quantity of an Egg, <hi>Cinnamon</hi> a Dram, a large <hi>Nutmeg</hi> grated, and two Drams of <hi>Sugar:</hi> Mix 'em all thorowly, then add half a Glaſs of <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> ſtirring 'em over a gentle Fire to incorporate all the Ingredients; and put the whole or one half into a Clout, tying it up in the form of a round Bag, which muſt be faſten'd to the Bit, that the Horſe may chew it three or four times every day: Half an Ounce of <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> ty'd to the Bit in a piece of Linnen, will, as I intimated before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce almoſt the ſame effect.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>How to promote the Evacuation of the Humor by the Noſe.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHen a Horſe, without loſing his Appetite voids the Humor that occaſions the <hi>Strangles</hi> imperfectly, or in too little a quantity by his Noſtrils; 'tis convenient to ſtir up languid Nature to expel her Enemy; for which purpoſe you may give the following Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Take the quantity of an Egg of freſh <hi>Butter,</hi> melt or fry it in a Skellet or Frying-Pan till it begin to grow black, then add ſtrong <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Oil Olive,</hi> of each half a Glaſs, and twice as much <hi>Pepper</hi> as you can lift with the ends of your Fingers: Mix 'em all together in the Skellet, and while the Compoſition is yet warm pour it into the Horſes Noſe thro' a Horn, one half into each Noſtril. As ſoon as he has taken this Remedy cover him with a Cloth, and walk him in your hand half an hour, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time he will be ſeiz'd with a Palpitation or bearing in the Flank, as if he were juſt ready to burſt, which ought not to ſurpriſe you, for it will not laſt above an hour or two, and after you have put him into the Stable he will void the Humor plentifully.</p>
                     <p>The days following you muſt lead him abroad for a quarter of an hour, in the Morning and Evening, in the Shade if it be Summer, and in the Sun if it be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, ſuffering him to walk with his Head bow'd down ſnuffing the Ground. And beſides, you muſt always make him eat low, to facilitate the Purgation of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>You will doubtleſs be ſurpriz'd to perceive that, by the uſe of this Medicine, the Horſe will void more Phlegm and filthy Matter in one day, than all the uſual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could have made him expel in fifteen days. But it muſt be us'd ſparingly, and with caution; for if it be given to a perfectly ſound Horſe, it will immediately make him void a great quantity of ſeemingly corrupt Phlegm by the Noſe; but the Matter thus expell'd only appears to be filthy, becauſe it is drawn from its natural place, where it was neither hurtful nor corrupt, tho' it ſeems to be ſo after 'tis evacuated. And therefore this Remedy muſt only be given to thoſe Horſes whoſe Paſſages are open, that is, after they have begun to void Humours by the Noſe, or when 'tis plain that they are not able to expel the Matter by reaſon of their Weakneſs, or the defect of natural Heat; in all which caſes we may exhibit this Remedy ſafely and with good Succeſs, ſince by ſo doing we purſue the way that Nature has already mark'd out, which is always the ſureſt courſe.</p>
                     <p>When Nature informs us, that the Horſe ought to be reliev'd, and help'd to get rid of a burthen that oppreſſes him, and hinders him from performing his uſual Functions, and that the Humour ought to be expell'd by the Noſe, we are oblig'd in prudence to follow, aid, and ſtrengthen her Motions; by which method the Horſe will certainly be cas'd, whereas all raſh and unſeaſonable Attempts are not only prejudicial, but will at laſt prove fatal to him.</p>
                     <p>I have given this Remedy to Horſes that return'd from the Army ſpent, lean, and haraſs'd, whoſe Age, and every other Circumſtance made it altogether improbable, that ever they ſhould be able to expel noxious Humours by the Noſe; and yet they did actually void great quantities of Phlegm, and were eas'd for a time, tho' not without danger of ſinking under the violence of that Evacuation; which, in my Opinion, ought never to be provok'd, whatever ſucceſs it may have had in ſome particular caſes, till you are convinc'd by evident ſigns that the Horſe is diſpos'd to diſcharge the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by thoſe Paſſages; in which caſe Nature is your Guide, and you can never err, while the end of all your Attempts is to help her to expel that which offends her, by the moſt convenient Paſſages, which, according to the preſent ſuppoſition are the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils. But if any Man ſhall be ſo fond of this Medicine, becauſe he is not oblig'd to go further than his Kitchin for the Ingredients of which 'tis compounded, as to uſe it inconſiderately, and without obſerving theſe Directions, he muſt expect at laſt to pay dearly for that convenience, ſince he forces Nature to ſuch Methods of Evacuation as are contrary to the preſent diſpoſition of the Horſe.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:179659:239"/>
                     <p>I had once occaſion to attempt the Cure of a Horſe that was ſuſpected to have the <hi>Glanders;</hi> and intending to provoke a plentiful Evacuation, I gave him a double Doſe of this Remedy, which made him ſo averſe to all manner of Food, that he was five days without Eating, and in the mean time ſeiz'd with a vehement beating in his Plank, which made me conclude that he would certainly die, tho', after all, he eſcap'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my expectation. Nevertheleſs I'm convinc'd by daily experience, that when a Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Glanders,</hi> this Medicine may be given ſafely, and even ſeyeral times repeated, after conſiderable Intervals, provided the Doſe be not much augmented: For 'tis plain that Nature has already taken that courſe, and we only aſſiſt her to ſhake off the load that overwhelms her. Immediately after the taking of the Remedy, the Horſe ſeems juſt ready to expire, by reaſon of the violent Beating which it cauſes in his Flank; but that Storm is quickly appeas'd.</p>
                     <p>'Tis by no means convenient to adminiſter this Remedy to Horſes that have loſt their Appetite, for they are not able to bear the violence of its Operation: Nor can it be given in very cold Weather, without hazarding the Horſe's Life; for all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Evacuations are equally dangerous in extreamly Cold and Hot Seaſons.</p>
                     <p>When any of the noble or principal Parts are vitiated, you may ſave the Charge and Trouble of a tedious Sickneſs, by giving this Medicine, which will haſten the Horſe's Death: For tis impoſſible that he ſhould ſubſiſt long when one of the noble Parts is corrupted, and ſince you muſt loſe him, the ſooner you are rid of him 'tis the better.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy ſhould be given rather in the <hi>Wane,</hi> than in the <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of the <hi>Moon:</hi> For when 'tis adminiſter'd during the <hi>Encreaſe,</hi> it makes ſuch havock, and ſo diſorders the Oeconomy of Nature, that it cannot be reſtor'd to its wonted courſe in a long time after; but in the declination or <hi>Wane</hi> it does not produce ſuch violent Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. It ought not to be given on the day of the <hi>Full-Moon,</hi> but it may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd with very good Succeſs the next day after. Theſe Obſervations are very uſeful, and may be cautiouſly obſerv'd, when the diſpoſal of the Time is in our Power.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain <hi>Salt</hi> in the Matter that is evacuated, which is grateful to the Horſe's Taſte, and makes him lick and ſwallow it: But ſince 'tis ſharp and biting, it may ulcerate his inward Parts; and therefore you ought to wipe his Noſe with Hay as oft as you can.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, you muſt never ſuffer him to drink raw Water; but inſtead of that give him Water that has been boil'd, mixt with a little Bran, or rather Flower: If you could make him drink it hot, it would be ſo much the better; but few Horſes will drink any Liquor that is not either cold, or at leaſt only luke-warm.</p>
                     <p>You muſt never forget to ſeparate the Horſe, during the time of his Evacuation, from all other Horſes: For not only this is a contagious Diſtemper, but a ſound Horſe may catch the <hi>Glanders</hi> from one that is troubl'd only with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> and even tho' he ſhould not lick the Matter that flows out of his Companion's Noſe, which he will certainly do if he can; becauſe the very Smell is ſufficient to communicate the Diſeaſe, which may be alſo propagated by drinking out of the ſame Pail.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall propoſe other Remedies to promote Evacuation by the Noſe, in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> which may be us'd upon occaſion; tho' that which I have already deſcrib'd is of excellent uſe when there is not an Ulcer in the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>If the violence of the Evacuation caus'd by this Medicine make the Horſe abſtain from Eating, which happens very rarely, give him the Electuary deſcrib'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, or ſome Cordial Powders; and if, after all, his averſion to his Food continue, make him chew the <hi>Balls</hi> propos'd in the Eighth Chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Falſe or Baſtard</hi> Strangles.</head>
                     <p>SOmetimes the Humours are not diſpos'd to produce the Fermentation that cauſes the <hi>Strangles</hi> at the uſual time, which defect of Fermentation may proceed either from the ſtrength or weakneſs of Nature; ſo that in ſuch caſes the agitation of the Humors is imperfectly and weakly perform'd, for want of proper Remedies, from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179659:239"/>whence 'tis plain that the noxious Matter cannot be fully expell'd, but a Ferment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Body, which in its proper time will agitate the Humours that are diſpos'd to follow its Motions, and cauſe a ſort of Fermentation, which will oblige oppreſs'd Nature to renew her Endeavours to caſt forth the Remainders of thoſe Impurities, which ſhe could not fully evacuate before: Sometimes in this kind of <hi>Strangles</hi> ſhe expels 'em by the Noſe, and ſometimes alſo by Swellings under the Throat, as in the true <hi>Strangles.</hi> When the Horſe is old the Humour is uſually diſcharg'd by a large Swelling at the ſide of the Jaw-bone, in the ſame part out of which the <hi>Vives</hi> are drawn, which ſuppurates and breaks at the age of Ten, Twelve, or Fifteen Years. Theſe Horſes muſt be very diligently aſſiſted, for they are hardly able to expel the venomous Matter; for which purpoſe I make uſe of the <hi>Treacle-Balls,</hi> which I have frequently repeated ſix or ten times, and ſome ſoftening Clyſters when the Diſeaſe was accompany'd with Loſs of Appetite; for <hi>Clyſters</hi> are never hurtful in any Caſe whatſoever. Uſually theſe Horſes void no Matter by the Noſtrils, but the whole Malignity is evacuated by the Humour that is drawn out of the Swelling: and after 'tis wholly expell'd, I make 'em eat two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Powder mix'd with <hi>Bran,</hi> till they have conſum'd two Pounds, to compleat their Recovery; for they are commonly very much worn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated by their Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Falſe Strangles</hi> are known by the ſame Signs that denote the Diſeaſe properly ſo call'd, which are much different from the <hi>Glanders;</hi> only the laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Diſtemper begins not with a great Beating in the Flank, and difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the <hi>Falſe-Strangles</hi> do. And when after the uſe of Remedies a Swelling ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at the ſide of the Jaw-bone, in the part from whence the <hi>Vives</hi> are drawn, you may certainly conclude that the Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Falſe-Strangles,</hi> which are rarely evacuated by the Noſtrils in old Horſes, but almoſt always by a Tumor at the ſide of the Jaw-bone, tho' ſometimes when they are not above ſix or ſeven Years old, the Swelling breaks forth between the two Jaw-bones, in which caſe they alſo void Matter by the Noſe, and 'tis plain by their Age that their Diſtemper is not the <hi>Glanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper makes the Horſes a great deal more ſick than the true <hi>Strangles,</hi> and ſometimes they die for want of due Aſſiſtance, or the Diſeaſe generates to the <hi>Glanders:</hi> And therefore great care muſt be taken to keep 'em warm, and to adminiſter effectual Remedies.</p>
                     <p>You may give the ſick Horſe, once in two days, a Doſe of the <hi>Electuary of Kermes,</hi> or of the <hi>Lieutenant's-Powder, Cordial-Powder, Cordial-Balls,</hi> or <hi>Pills,</hi> and ſome <hi>Clyſters,</hi> then Syringe him, and put Feathers into his Noſe, and Bags into his Mouth, as in the cure of <hi>Strangles.</hi> When he ſlights his Food, and eats little, you muſt not give him any <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> but good ſoftning <hi>Clyſters,</hi> after which give him the Cordial-Waters of <hi>Scorzonera, Bugloſs, Carduus Benediclus,</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> of each half a Pint, with an Ounce of the Confection of <hi>Al-Kermes,</hi> without <hi>Musk</hi> or <hi>Amber-griſe,</hi> or of the Electuary of <hi>Kermes,</hi> and the ſame Evening a good <hi>Clyſter</hi> with <hi>Sal Polycreſt,</hi> repeating the ſame every two days. But if he is only troubl'd with a loathing of his Food, without Beating in his Flank, or a Fever, you muſt obſerve the Directions propos'd in the Sixth Chapter; prepare a Bag for him with an Ounce of <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> and every day make him drink a Pint of good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, which is very good for the <hi>Baſtard Strangles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards, if he has any <hi>Kernels,</hi> you muſt bring 'em to Suppuration; which you will find a harder Task to perform, than in the true <hi>Strangles,</hi> whether they be under the Throat or at the ſide of it: And if they be not prevented by proper Remedies, they will either ſtrike inward, or harden and remain in that condition, or perhaps grow ſo big as to hinder Reſpiration. To advance the Suppuration, you may give him two or three Doſes of <hi>Cordial Balls,</hi> which are very uſeful to drive out the Humour. If notwithſtanding theſe Remedies the Matter or Quitter is not yet generated, you muſt give him three Doſes more with a Pint of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine mixt with the ſame quantity of ſome other ſort of Wine for each Doſe; then rub the top of the <hi>Gland</hi> with a <hi>Retoire,</hi> holding a red-hot Iron near it, that the <hi>Retoire</hi> may penetrate, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Suppuration, and draw the Matter powerfully. If all theſe Remedies prove ineffectual, you muſt have recourſe to the Medicine for reſolving <hi>Glands</hi> deſcrib'd in the Twentieth Chapter, which, if it be carefully prepar'd, will infallibly reſolve and diſſipate the <hi>Gland</hi> or <hi>Kernel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides all theſe Remedies, you may burn the Hair on the <hi>Glands</hi> with a ſearing Candle, and afterwards apply to the part a large Plaiſter made of <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum,</hi> or of <hi>Manus Dei,</hi> or of the greater <hi>Diachylum with the Gums,</hi> both which may be had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179659:240"/>from Apothecaries, ſpread the Plaiſter on thin white Leather, and apply it to the <hi>Gland,</hi> laying over it a Lamb's Skin, which ought alſo to cover ſome of the parts under the Head: You muſt let the Plaiſter ſtick till the Matter is ripen'd in the <hi>Kernel,</hi> and then open it with a red-hot Iron, putting in Tents, as before.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Plaiſters be not ſtrong enough to bring the <hi>Glands</hi> to Suppuration, you muſt uſe another of the Ointment of <hi>Beetles,</hi> or that which follows.</p>

                     <p>THis Ointment is not only fit to be apply'd to the <hi>Glands</hi> between, or at the ſide of the Jaw-Bones, but good for all manner of Swellings that ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated, if the part be often chaf'd with it, and kept very warm. 'Tis prepar'd thus: Take four Ounces of <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> melt it in a Skellet, and add an Ounce of <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum,</hi> or of <hi>Manus Dei,</hi> which is as good, and is kept by all Apothecaries: after they are melted into one Maſs, remove the Skellet from the Fire, and add three Ounces of old <hi>Treacle,</hi> the older the better; mix 'em all thorowly, and make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which you muſt every day chafe the <hi>Gland,</hi> or the part that is to be brought to Suppuration, and you will ſoon perceive its Efficacy. Sometimes the Ointment is too hard; for the Farriers of <hi>Paris</hi> deſire their <hi>Baſilicum</hi> to be made very hard, and the Apothecaries, to pleaſe 'em, add a great deal of Roſin to thicken it, which does not at all augment its Vertue; and therefore in that caſe you may add to the whole quantity an Ounce of old Oil-<hi>Olive,</hi> which will bring it to a due conſiſtency.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the</hi> Cold Rheum, <hi>or</hi> Morfounding.</head>
                     <p>THE word <hi>Rheum,</hi> in the general, ſignifies all ſorts of Defluxions that flow from one part and fall upon another; but properly ſpeaking, the Rheum in Horſes is a Defluxion under the Throat, and on other neighbouring parts of raw, phlegmatick, and ſuperfluous Humours, that are gather'd either by a great Cold, or for want of Digeſtion, or by reaſon of ſome particular Diſtempers, or exhal'd from the inward parts.</p>
                     <p>The remote cauſes of this Diſeaſe are of a different Nature: Sometimes 'tis occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by being ſuddenly expos'd to the Cold, after having ſuffered a vehement Heat. Thus immoderate Exerciſe or Labour, beyond the ſtrength of a Horſe, heats not only his outward, but even his inward parts: And if he be ſuffer'd to catch Cold preſently after, or expos'd to the cold Air in a Harveſt-night, immediately the Defluxion ſeizes on ſome inward parts of the Body, and hinders 'em from performing their Functions.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes thick and viſcous Humours being diſſolv'd and melted by long and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Exerciſe, fall upon the Lungs, where they cauſe Obſtructions, which are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with difficulty of Breathing: Or if Nature be ſtrong enough to expel 'em, they flow out of the Noſe in the form of white or green Snot, which, according to its ſharpneſs, produces a Cough.</p>
                     <p>The abundant flowing out of the Humour has given occaſion to frequent Miſtakes; and ſeveral Horſes have been ſuſpected to have the <hi>Glanders,</hi> who were only troubled with a <hi>Cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe may be alſo occaſion'd by ſuffering a Horſe to Drink while he is hot, without riding him afterwards; or by his drinking very cold Water too greedily in Summer, or melted Snow.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:179659:240"/>
                     <p>The ſigns of a <hi>Cold</hi> are theſe; Dulneſs, Want of Appetite, a Cough, and running at the Noſe: To diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Strangles,</hi> you muſt enquire whether the Horſe has been expos'd to any of thoſe Inconveniencies that may cauſe a <hi>Cold,</hi> and if he has, you may certainly conclude that to be the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Another ſign is, when his Throat is drier and harder than uſually: You may eaſily perceive whether 'tis harder by feeling it; and this hardneſs proceeds from the Heat and Drineſs, which are the effects of the <hi>Cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Cold</hi> is ſo violent, that it throws the Horſe into a Fever, with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt danger of his Life; in which caſe his Neck-Vein muſt be open'd, and oftentimes the ſame Operation is repeated. <hi>Bleeding</hi> is alſo eſteem'd proper, when a Horſe is troubl'd with ſo great an Oppreſſion in his Breaſt that he cannot Breathe.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are alſo let Blood when the <hi>Cold</hi> is accompani'd with a <hi>Quinſie,</hi> or Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Throat</hi> that hinders 'em from ſwallowing. In theſe three Caſes <hi>Bleeding</hi> is profitable for a Horſe that is troubl'd with a <hi>Cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is very dangerous when it ſeizes a Horſe in the <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> for his Lungs are oppreſs'd with a multitude of Humours, that encreaſe with that Planet; beſides, the Defluxion falls upon all the inward parts of the Body, and almoſt always the Diſeaſe is of long continuance, as being caus'd by Fulneſs. For 'tis certain that all Diſeaſes proceeding from Fulneſs, when they happen during the encreaſe of the Moon, are ſtronger and more apt to overwhelm Nature, and diſturb her in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of her Functions, by reaſon of the encreaſe of Humours at that time.</p>
                     <p>But when it happens in the <hi>Wane</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> 'tis of ſhorter continuance, and leſs violent; for the Humours decreaſe with the Moon, and the Horſe recovers ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Obſervations be not attentively conſider'd by thoſe who undertake the Cure of Horſes, they will hardly be able to make a certain Judgment concerning the length and dangerouſneſs of their Diſtempers, or to preſcribe a ſucceſsful Method of Cure. This Aſſertion is grounded on a certain knowledge of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The way of curing a <hi>Cold</hi> is the ſame with that which I preſcrib'd for the <hi>Strangles,</hi> For you muſt cover the Horſe's Neck with a Furr'd Skin, keep him warm, give him the <hi>Electuary of Kermes,</hi> put Baggs with <hi>Aſſa-Foetida</hi> into his Mouth, thruſt Feathers into his Noſe, Syringe him, and proceed in all other reſpects as in the Cure of the <hi>Strangles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you perceive that your Horſe has not wholly loſt his Appetite, you may give him the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> every three days, or rather the <hi>Electuary of Kermes.</hi> And when the Diſeaſe is attended with a total loſs of Appetite, you cannot give a better Remedy than that <hi>Electuary</hi> in a Pint of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, once in two days, if he has not a Fever; or if he have a Fever, you may give him the <hi>Cordial Waters</hi> with <hi>Clyſters</hi> both before and after.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arman</hi> deſcrib'd Chap. VII. is very good in this caſe: It may be given five or ſix times in the day, tying it to the Bit, and will be found to be a Sovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>Take the ſick Horſe's <hi>Urine,</hi> while 'tis yet hot, mix it with an equal quantity of <hi>Wine,</hi> about a Pint, or a Pint and half of each, and make him drink it all up; then cover him, and let him ſtand Bridl'd two hours. Repeat the ſame ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot have his <hi>Urine</hi> hot, take a Pint of <hi>Fleſh-Broath,</hi> without Fat or Salt, and as much <hi>Wine,</hi> mix 'em for a <hi>Draught.</hi> Repeat the ſame three or four days, and if he Sweat not after the firſt Doſe, add to the Draught an Ounce of the <hi>Cordial-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and cover him well. Continue after the ſame manner for ſome days.</p>

                        <p>Let not this Compoſition offend thoſe who are only pleas'd with Cooling Remedies; for Horſes muſt not be us'd like Men. If you cool 'em too much, when they are troubl'd with this Diſtemper, you will ſtifle em; and therefore beware of purely cooling Medicines. You will quickly be ſenſible of the good effects of This, which contains many hot Ingredients; but ſince they are agreeable to the nature of Horſes, they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179659:241"/>do not inflame 'em, and cauſe only ſo much Heat as is neceſſary to ſtrengthen the Parts. Experience will convince you of the Truth of my Aſſertion, for the Remedy will ſucceed; and I ſhall take occaſion hereafter to demonſtrate, that there is need of a great deal of Prudence to adminiſter cooling Remedies to a Horſe with ſafety and ſucceſs.</p>

The Medicine will be more effectual, if you add a Pound of the <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Kermes;</hi> but ſince they cannot be kept without loſing a part of their Virtue, 'tis better to mix 'em with Balls, that they may be preſerv'd in their intire Force. Beat all the Ingredients ſeparately, reducing 'em to a groſs Powder; then ſtrain 'em thro' a Hair-Sieve, mix the whole Powder exactly and weigh it, for you muſt not weigh the Drugs before they are beat and ſearc'd a-part. The Powder may be preſerv'd a long time without any diminution of its Virtue, if it be preſs'd hard in a leathern Bag, which muſt be kept cloſe ty'd.</p>
                     <p>This is ſo univerſal a Remedy, that every Man who keeps a Horſe ſhou'd always have ſome of it by him, eſpecially on a Journey, or in the Army, where there is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to make it; for by the Uſe of this Medicine Horſes have been frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from ſeveral very conſiderable Infirmities.</p>
                     <p>The Virtue of this Powder decays if it be kept too long; and therefore the beſt way is to prepare a ſmall Quantity of it, that you may always have ſome of it freſh. I have lately found out a way, which has prov'd very ſucceſsful, to keep it Thirty Years in its full Strength, and beſides to render it portable, and more effectual, which are certainly very great Advantages. I reduce it to <hi>Balls,</hi> which are ſo hard that the Air cannot penetrate nor ſpoil 'em; and a Man may carry 'em in his Pocket, Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle, or any other way that ſhall be moſt convenient.

Set it on the Fire to boil, ſtirring it ſometimes till it grow thick; then preſs it out, and reſerve the Liquor. Strain the remaining Subſtance thro' a Searſe as they uſe to ſtrain <hi>Caſſia,</hi> throw away the Husks and Berries, and mix the ſtrain'd Pulp with the above-mention'd Liquor. Boil it again over a clear Fire, ſtirring it from time to time, till it be reduc'd to the Thickneſs of Broth; then take it from the Fire, and when 'tis half cold, mix it in a Mortar with the full Quantity of the <hi>Powder</hi> preſcrib'd in the preceding Chapter, adding a Pound of the <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Kermes</hi> in Powder. Make up the whole Maſs into <hi>Balls,</hi> weighing twelve Drams each, which muſt be dry'd on the Strainer with its Bottom turn'd upwards. Theſe Balls grow little, and very hard; but they muſt be made in Summer, for they are not eaſily dry'd in the Winter, and beſides they grow mouldy, if they be not kept in a Stove or Skellet. After they are dry they loſe not their Virtue; and the Addition of the <hi>Mucilage</hi> of <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> which ſerves for a Cement to unite the parts of the Powder, does alſo very much augment its Efficacy; for thoſe Berries alone are endow'd with admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: They are good for the Stomach and Breaſt, provoke Urine, and may be juſtly call'd the <hi>Treacle</hi> of the <hi>Germans.</hi> But the Powder may be made up into Balls without any <hi>Mucilaginous</hi> or glewy Subſtance, after the following Manner: Put the Powder into a large Mortar, and mix it with a little Cordial Water of <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> or ſuch like; and after you have beaten and mix'd 'em with the Peſtle, pour in more Water, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to beat, mix, and add new Water by turns, till the whole Maſs be of a ſufficient Conſiſtency to be made up into <hi>Balls.</hi>

                     <p>Thoſe Balls may be dry'd ſooner and more eaſily than the others, but ſince the <hi>Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi> of the <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> does very much increaſe the Virtue of the Balls, inſtead of that you muſt add half a Pound of the <hi>Berries,</hi> which you may beat with the reſt of the Compoſition, when you mix it with the Water, and beat it up to a Maſs; and it will be ſtill more effectual, as I hinted before, if a Pound of <hi>Grains of Kermes</hi> be added to it. When you have occaſion to uſe the Balls, you muſt beat 'em to a groſs Powder, which you may either infuſe a whole Night, or mix with Wine immediately before

                     <p>I give 'em the Name of <hi>Treacle-Pills</hi> or <hi>Balls,</hi> becauſe they have all the Virtues of <hi>Treacle,</hi> and are even in ſome reſpects better, ſince there is not the leaſt Mixture of <hi>Honey,</hi> and they are compos'd of Ingredients that ſtrengthen Nature without inflaming it.

And Experience will convince you that this Remedy reſtores Health, without heating the Body too much.</p>
                     <p>The ſhivering Fits that are occaſion'd by the drinking of extremely cold Water, may be quickly ſtopt, by giving one of theſe Balls beaten to Powder in a Pint of good Wine, and the ſooner, if you mix 'em with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe forſakes his Meat on a Journey, give him two of theſe <hi>Balls</hi> in a a Quart of Wine, and after you have kept him two hours bridl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d, he will eat aſſoon as you unbridle him. This Remedy is not inferiour to the <hi>Lieutenant's Powder;</hi> and you may alſo give a Doſe of it by way of Prevention to preſerve Horſes from Diſeaſes. There are ſeveral Perſons who wou'd value themſelves very highly upon the Invention of ſuch a Secret, and would be very loth to communicate it to the Public.</p>
                     <p>The Doſe of the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> is two Ounces; but ſince there is no Danger in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Quantity, if you have not Scales by you, you may give three ſilver Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls to large Horſes, and two to ſmall ones. Infuſe it cold all Night in a Quart of red Wine, and in the Morning give it to the Horſe, keeping him bridl'd four hours before, and two hours after. And beſides you muſt rinſe the Pot or Horn with another half Pint of Wine, and give it to the Horſe to waſh his Mouth.</p>
                     <p>You may either infuſe the <hi>Balls,</hi> or mix 'em immediately before you give 'em; and you may repeat the Doſe of either the <hi>Balls</hi> or <hi>Powder</hi> every Morning for three or four Days together. To a Horſe troubl'd with the Cold, who voids Matter, or coughs, you may give either of theſe Remedies with very good Succeſs, in a Quart of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine. Neither muſt you be afraid that they will heat him too much, for that which is call'd <hi>Heat</hi> in Horſes proceeds only from the <hi>acid</hi> or ſharp Juice, that abounds in his Stomach, and flowing out of its natural Place, diſturbs and interrupts the Digeſtions that ought to be perform'd in each part. This Humour being out of its natural Place, becomes the Principle of Heat and Corruption, and there is none elſe in Horſes: from whence 'tis plain that it ought to be blunted and deſtroy'd by <hi>Alkalies</hi> or fixt Salts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Learned <hi>Chymiſts.</hi> Now theſe Compoſitions are full of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that abound with a ſweet <hi>Alkali,</hi> which deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I cou'd eaſily demonſtrate that the <hi>acid</hi> Juice, which is of a piercing and diſſolving Nature, and cauſes Digeſtion in the Stomach, is the Source of all thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes that are call'd <hi>Hot,</hi> when it abounds too much, and leaves its natural place, the Stomach. But ſuch a Diſſertation wou'd rather tire, than inſtruct the Reader; and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I have ſaid is ſufficient for the Wiſe. And therefore I ſhall only repeat my Aſſertion, that the preternatural <hi>Heat</hi> in Horſes proceeds uſually from the too great Abundance of the <hi>Acid</hi> Juice, which flowing out of the Stomach, becomes the Principle of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Heat, and the Cauſe of many Diſeaſes.

For three or four Doſes of 'em taken ſucceſſively will rouze and ſtrengthen Nature, and make the Horſe that is troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> expel the whole Humour that occaſions the Diſeaſe, by which means it prevents the <hi>falſe Strangles,</hi> that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence of Imperfect Evacuations. They may be alſo given profitably in the Cure of the <hi>Trembling</hi> or <hi>Beating in the Flanks, Gripes, Vives, Loſs of Appetite</hi> by the Abundance of Phlegm and Crudities, <hi>Cold, Cough, Strangles,</hi> and ſeveral other Indiſpoſitions, as I ſhall intimate afterwards. In ſhort, there are few Diſtempers which they do not help to remove, and are even proper for Horſes, who at their return from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179659:242"/>the Army or from a long Journey, are diſpirited, lean, and ſpent, with briſtl'd up Hair, and can never be made fat, how plentifully ſoever you feed 'em.</p>
                     <p>A Spoonful of the <hi>Powder,</hi> or a <hi>Ball</hi> beaten and mixt with Oats as often as you allow him any, will cure an inveterate Cough, and make him long-winded.</p>
                     <p>They will help a Horſe to expel Humours by the Noſe, when he is diſpos'd to that kind of Evacuation: but their uſual Effect is to provoke Urine, or inſenſible Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and to enable Nature to ſhake off the Burthen that oppreſſes her, and to drive out all Impurities, without Purgation which is contrary to the Nature of Horſes.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other Deſcriptions of <hi>Cordial Powders</hi> now in Uſe; but they conſiſt either of too great, or too ſmall a Number of Ingredients; and they are uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of <hi>Herbs</hi> which cannot be ſuppos'd to operate effectually on Horſes, who daily eat a greater quantity of 'em among their <hi>Hay,</hi> than you can give 'em, in ſix Doſes of <hi>Powder:</hi> but the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Seeds,</hi> in which the Virtues of Simples are united and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated, are of more excellent Uſe. Experience will convince you of the Efficacy of this Powder, neither is it too chargeable, for there are many <hi>Cordial Powders</hi> which coſt a great deal more, and are yet far inferiour to it in Virtue. Only the <hi>Cubebs</hi> are dear, becauſe they are brought from a remote Country; but you may leave them out, and inſtead of 'em ſubſtitute a triple quantity of <hi>Juniper-Berries;</hi> tho' the former are certainly endu'd with admirable Virtues. They are found only in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Java</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they grow in Cluſters like Grapes, on a Shrub, that like the <hi>Pepper-Tree,</hi> muſt be ſupported by ſome other Tree: and the <hi>Javaners,</hi> to keep 'em wholly to themſelves, will not ſuffer any <hi>Syens</hi> to be exported, tho' the Fruit is ſold very cheap there: It ſtrengthens the Stomach, clears the Paſſages of the Breaſt, and chears the languiſhing Heart.</p>
                     <p>Since 'tis convenient and almoſt neceſſary to be furniſh'd with ſeveral Remedies for the ſame deſign, add ſince the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> is one of thoſe that are moſt frequently us'd, I ſhall ſubjoin the Deſcription of another which is leſs compounded, tho' very effectual; for I have us'd it with good Succeſs, when the <hi>Univerſal Powder</hi> could not be had.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Glanders.</head>
                     <p>THis is a cold Diſeaſe, and may be fitly rank'd after the <hi>Strangles</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> with which it has ſome Affinity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Glanders</hi> is a flowing or running at the Noſtrils, of phlegmatic, tough, white, red, yellowiſh or greeniſh Humours, which are ſometimes deriv'd from the <hi>Spleen,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always from the <hi>Lungs,</hi> rarely from the <hi>Liver</hi> or <hi>Kidneys.</hi> The thinner Humours find a Paſſage thro' the <hi>Coeliac</hi> Vein, or the Paſſages of <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> and the thickeſt are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to the <hi>Throat,</hi> where they fall into a little Receptacle between the two <hi>Jaw-bones,</hi> and from thence by degrees dilating themſelves, they form and nouriſh the <hi>Kernels</hi> that are conſpicuous to the Eye, and the reſt of the Humour flows out of the <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> and diſcovers the Nature of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>immediate Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Glanders</hi> is frequently an Ulcer in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> (rarely in the <hi>Kidneys</hi>) from which ſubtle and malignant Vapours are ſent up to the <hi>Brain.</hi> Theſe thin Steams alter the very Subſtance of the <hi>Brain</hi> by their Sharpneſs, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd or thicken'd by the natural Coldneſs of that Part, produce a Humour of the ſame Nature with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which by its Acrimony irritates the Parts, and augments the Ulcer; from whence proceeds that troubleſome Flux of Humours thro' the <hi>Noſtrils.</hi> And whereas the two <hi>Jugular Veins</hi> furniſh and communicate a great Quantity of Blood to the <hi>Brain,</hi> the Subſtance of which is already alter'd by the malignant Vapours that glide thither perpetually thro' the <hi>Coeliac Vein</hi> as to the Head of an <hi>Alembic;</hi> the Blood inſtead of being further purify'd, according to the eſtabliſh'd Order of Nature, is corrupted, and from thence falling upon the <hi>Lungs</hi> heats 'em, and being render'd incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming its appointed Task, to nouriſh and refreſh that Part, ſerves only to augment the Ulcers that are already form'd in it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>outward Cauſes</hi> are almoſt the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> by which this Diſeaſe may be known, are when a Horſe already too old to be troubl'd with the <hi>Strangles,</hi> without a <hi>Cough,</hi> voids a great quantity of Matter by the Noſtrils; and when there are one or more <hi>Glands</hi> or Kernels faſten'd to the Bone between the two Jaw-bones, which are ſo tender, that the Horſe can hardly endure you to touch 'em: and tho' they be not faſten'd to the Bone, yet if they be hard and full of Pain, 'tis almoſt always a Sign of the <hi>Glanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Horſe void Matter by the Noſe, without a <hi>Cough,</hi> and have a Kernel ſticking to the Bone, you may conclude that his Diſtemper is not a <hi>Cold,</hi> which is uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with a <hi>Cough,</hi> whereas the <hi>Glanders</hi> are often without that Symptom: and beſides in the <hi>Glanders,</hi> the Matter uſually flows out of one Noſtril, whereas in the <hi>Cold</hi> it runs almoſt always out of both.</p>
                     <p>Some caſt the Matter that is voided by the Noſtrils into Water; and if it <hi>ſwim</hi> on the Top, they conclude the Horſe to be free of this Diſtemper; but if it <hi>ſink</hi> to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, 'tis a Sign of the <hi>Glanders.</hi> The principal Uſe of this Experiment is to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Pus,</hi> which is properly the Matter of an Ulcer or Impoſthume, from the <hi>Phlegm</hi> that comes out of the Veſſels, which is not ſo pernicious; for the Matter ſinks to the Bottom, and the Phlegm ſwims on the Top. But you muſt not depend on the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this Sign; for if the Matter ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ick to the Noſtrils like Glue, 'tis a bad Sign, and you may conclude the Diſeaſe to be the <hi>Glanders,</hi> tho' the Matter ſwim on the Top.</p>
                     <p>When either the Breath, or Matter that comes out of the Noſtrils, ſtinks, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is almoſt always incurable; for that noiſome Smell proceeds from ſome Ulcer or corrupt Humour, which at leaſt preſages the Length and Tediouſneſs of the Cure. When in the progreſs of the Diſtemper, the Humour voided by the Noſtrils turns to a frothy Subſtance, and continues to be ſo, the Diſeaſe is uſually incurable, and the Horſe dies quickly after.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen ſome Horſes troubl'd with this Diſtemper, without <hi>Kernels,</hi> or if there were any, they were little and moveable; and the only Sign by which we could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to be the <hi>Glanders,</hi> was the <hi>Glewineſs</hi> of the Matter, which ſtuck to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils; it flow'd not out, but obſtructing the Paſſages ſtopp'd the Horſe's Breath; but the Paſſages being clear'd by the help of a Syringe, he found Eaſe: and even the Matter was mixt with bloody Fibres, which ſhew'd that it proceeded from ſome Ulcer that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179659:243"/>render'd the Diſeaſe incurable; for not one of the Horſes eſcap'd, tho' no Means were neglected to preſerve 'em.</p>
                     <p>Some pretend that the Seat of this Diſeaſe is in the <hi>Brain:</hi> but 'tis certainly in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> rarely in the <hi>Liver, Kidneys</hi> or <hi>Milt,</hi> and never in the <hi>Brain.</hi> This I affirm on certain Knowledge; and the Account I have given of it is grounded on a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which nothing leſs than a plain Demonſtration of its Falſeneſs and Abſurdity, ſhall make me renounce.</p>
                     <p>This is the moſt <hi>contagious</hi> Diſtemper to which Horſes are obnoxious, for not only it communicates its Venom at a ſmall diſtance, but infects the very Air, and ſeizes on all the Horſes that are under the ſame Roof with him that languiſhes under it. And therefore aſſoon as you perceive the leaſt Sign of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> you muſt ſeparate the the ſick Horſe from all his Companions, and not ſuffer him to drink out of the ſame Pail with 'em; eſpecially when the Diſeaſe is malignant; for there are ſeveral kinds of <hi>Glanders,</hi> ſome of which are not ſo extremely infectious, as others, but there are none of 'em that ought not to be ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>I'm perſwaded that this Diſtemper proceeds from a <hi>cold</hi> Cauſe, and I do not at all doubt of the extream difficulty of the Cure. All its various kinds are only diſtinguiſh'd by a greater or leſs degree of Malignity; and it will be found that all thoſe who pretend to have cur'd the <hi>Glanders,</hi> have only cur'd either the <hi>Strangles, Cold,</hi> or ſome leſs malignant ſort of <hi>Glanders;</hi> for certainly theſe Cures are very <hi>rare,</hi> and (perhaps I might juſtly ſay) <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is caus'd and fomented by an <hi>Ulcer</hi> in the <hi>Lungs</hi> (rarely in any other part) which encreaſes, and, by degrees, conſumes the whole <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and at laſt kills the Horſe. If you do not begin, while 'tis ſtill poſſible to enable nature to conſolidate the Lungs, and heal the malignant Ulcer, you can never perfect the Cure. You may conclude the Diſeaſe to be incurable when 'tis ſeated in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> becauſe that Part will hardly yield to the Virtue of Medicines. To begin the Cure, you may by way of Precaution, <hi>take up</hi> the two Veins in the Neck, two Fingers breadth beneath the Place where the Horſe is uſually let Blood; the Operation is perform'd thus; Firſt, Make an Inciſion, and lay the Vein bare; then ſeparate it with a <hi>Cronet,</hi> and tye it with a double Thread of wax'd Silk, without cutting the Vein, leſt the Ends of it ſhould ſlip out of the Knot, when the Horſe eats and ſtirs his Jaws, with which one of the Branches of that Vein communicates: then fill the Wound with Salt, and do the ſame on the other ſide of the Neck. This Operation is alſo very uſeful for the Eyes that are either weak, or troubl'd with Defluxions; for theſe Veins being <hi>taken up,</hi> the impetuous Courſe of the Blood to the Brain will be ſtopp'd; and in the preſent Caſe, ſince the Brain receives a leſs quantity of Blood, the quantity of the ſharp Humour that falls upon the Lungs will be alſo diminiſh'd, and the Ulcer ſooner heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d: or at the leaſt 'tis certain that if the <hi>taking up</hi> of a Vein does not promote the Cure, it cannot hinder it. I ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is'd you not to cut the Vein between the two Knots, becauſe I have ſeen Horſes kill'd by ſo doing: for the Knot ſlipping, it was impoſſible to find the End of the Vein; and beſides the Motion of the Blood is ſtopp'd as effectully by <hi>taking up</hi> the Vein, as by <hi>cutting</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>Let the Horſe's uſual Food be <hi>moiſten'd Bran;</hi> let him not lie loitering in a Corner of the Stable, but uſe moderate Exerciſe; and his Ordinary Drink muſt be prepar'd thus. Melt two Pounds of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> in an Iron Spoon, and while it boils, throw it into a Pail of Water; then take out the <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> melt it again, and caſt it into the ſame Water, which the ſick Horſe muſt drink; for the Water will retain the ſweet and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamic <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> which is the <hi>Balſam of the Lungs.</hi> The progreſs of this Diſeaſe, even when 'tis incurable, is not very quick, but rather inſenſible: for the Sharpneſs of the Matter increaſes by degrees, as the Ulcer grows greater, and the Part affected is piece-meal conſum'd; in the mean time the neighbouring Parts are ſpoil'd, the whole Body pines away, and receives no Benefit by the beſt and largeſt Supplies of Nouriſhment. Some Horſes cannot endure the Water prepar'd with <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> and therefore you muſt take the <hi>Paſte</hi> of a <hi>Peny White-Loaf,</hi> when 'tis juſt ready to be put into the Oven, and ſteep it in the Water, for the Tartneſs of the <hi>Paſte</hi> will correct the loathſome Taſte of the <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> and make the Water grateful to the Horſe; and beſides it nouriſhes him, and comforts his inward Parts.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Ulcer</hi> increaſes in a part ſo near the Heart, it cauſes a <hi>Hectic F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſince 'tis hard to know certainly whether the <hi>Glanders</hi> be of this kind, which almoſt always proves Mortal, you muſt endeavour to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179659:244"/>diſcover the nature of the Diſeaſe by the application of proper Remedies, by the ſucceſs of which you may perceive whether there be any hopes of the Cure: Thus you may exhibit the <hi>Drink</hi> which I preſcrib'd, for 'tis very proper in all the various ſorts of <hi>Glanders,</hi> eſpecially in the moſt dangerous kind, that which affects the <hi>Lungs.</hi> And to convince you that you ought not to deſpair of the Cure, at the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Diſtemper, 'tis obſerv'd that ſome Horſes recover of themſelves in the Stable; but this happens only when there is not an Ulcer, the matter not being ſharp enough to corrode and waſte the part: However, ſince 'tis impoſſible to judge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the Malignity of the Diſtemper, you muſt not neglect the uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                     <p>The Horſes that are ſeiz'd with this Diſeaſe, are frequently put into a way of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the uſe of good Remedies, which would even perfect the Cure, if the Lungs were not already waſted; but <hi>God</hi> alone can reſtore a conſum'd Part. I remember I attempted the Cure of a Horſe troubl'd with the <hi>Glanders,</hi> and kept him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of Remedies for a whole Month together: Every Morning I made him drink three Pints of the <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> with two Ounces of the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi> and in the Evenings I <hi>Syring'd</hi> his Noſe with half a Glaſs of the ſame Wine, which diſſolv'd the <hi>Kernel</hi> between his two Cheek-Bones, and gave him a good Appetite to his Meat: His Eye look'd well, he voided leſs Matter, and had all the ſigns of Amendment; after which I purg'd him, and committed the reſt of the Cure to Nature; but the Horſe by degrees pin'd away, and at laſt dy'd. After his Death I open'd his Body, and found his Lungs wholly turn'd to a Maſs of Corruption. I confeſs I ought not to have purg'd him during the time of his Evacuation at the Noſe: For Experience has ſince convinc'd me that the Purgation of a Horſe, when he voids Matter by the Noſe, is apt to give him the <hi>Glanders,</hi> tho' he have it not already.</p>
                     <p>This puts me in mind of another Horſe that was committed to my care, to whom I gave two Doſes of the Remedy deſcrib'd in the following Chapter, which made him void abundance of Matter. Then I purg'd him, and afterwards gave him three Doſes of the <hi>Cordial Pills</hi> in Wine, for three days together, and eight days after three Doſes more, but the Evacuation of the Matter was wholly ſtop'd. I order'd him to be air'd and walk'd; and, to compleat the Cure, according to my judgment at that time, I purg'd him again ten days after, and at laſt took out the <hi>Kernel,</hi> which was large and fix'd. The Wound being clos'd, I let him Blood, and concluding him to be cur'd, ſent him to his Maſter. Six Months after he began to void Matter again, and continu'd in that condition above ſix Years, during which time he was able to walk a foot-pace, and Work very well; but at laſt he pin'd away, and died.</p>
                     <p>I thought fit to communicate theſe two Inſtances, out of a hundred others I have met with in my Practice, to demonſtrate that oftentimes the Horſe is in the greateſt danger when he ſeems to be cur'd. And therefore when a Farrier undertakes to cure a Horſe of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> you may conclude that either he will hardly be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Promiſe, or that the Diſeaſe is not really what you imagine it to be.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a moſt certain Rule, that a Horſe ſhould never be <hi>Purg'd</hi> while he voids Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the <hi>Noſe;</hi> for a <hi>Purging</hi> Medicine may throw him into this Diſtemper, tho' he were free of it before. We muſt follow Nature in the Cure of Diſeaſes, and not compel her to change her courſe, or to ſubmit to one that is oppoſite to that which ſhe has already taken, as <hi>Purgation</hi> is in the preſent caſe. 'Tis true, moſt Farriers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Method, but I'm fully convinc'd that 'tis very dangerous, and oftentimes fatal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> never purges a Horſe, tho' the Doſe be augmented to two or three Quarts; for it works by inſenſible Tranſpiration, and is an excellent Remedy. You will find it deſcrib'd in the Twenty Third Chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>How to expel the Matter by the</hi> Noſe.</head>
                     <p>I Shall proceed to deſcribe ſome Remedies proper for this Diſtemper: And if the Caſe be not altogether deſperate, you will quickly perceive the good effects of 'em.</p>
                     <p>Before you give any Remedies, you muſt conſider whether the ſick Horſe be a hearty Feeder: For if he be nice and ſqueamiſh, the Cure will never ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your deſire, ſince ſome of the Medicines you muſt give him will encreaſe the natural Infirmity of his Stomach; ſo that it will coſt you as much Pains and Time to reſtore his <hi>Appetite</hi> as to cure the <hi>Glonders,</hi> and at the end you will find it impoſſible to compaſs your deſign. But if the Horſe that is committed to your Care be a good Eater, in the firſt place make him abſtain from his <hi>Oats,</hi> then take <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> and <hi>Oil Olive,</hi> of each a Quart, mix or brew 'em together in a Pot, till they be perfectly united, and ſpurt ſome of this Liquor into his Noſtrils five or ſix times every day. Theſe Injections will cure the little <hi>Ulcers</hi> in his Noſtrils that are caus'd by the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malignity of the Matter, and facilitate the deſcent of the Humour which is apt to ſtick and grow dry in the Paſſages, and ſtop the Horſe's Breath; and therefore you muſt Syringe his Noſtrils both before and after you give him a Medicine to expel the Matter.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards take four Spoonfuls of ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and as much good <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> diſſolve in 'em a Dram of <hi>Treacle</hi> above two Years Old, and add a Scruple of <hi>White-Hellebor</hi> in Powder, and two grains of Powder of <hi>Long Pepper:</hi> Mix 'em all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and inject the mixture into the Horſe's Noſe, one half into each Noſtril, then walk him in his Cloaths at a foot-pace, for the ſpace of an hour, ſuffering him to ſnuff the Ground with his Noſe, and he will infallibly caſt forth abundance of Matter: Nor muſt you be ſurpriz'd if he loſe his Appetite, for he will quickly recover it. If any noble part be affected he will die in a little time; but if he live beyond that time, there is ſome hope of his Recovery. Let him ſtand Bridl'd four hours before you give him this Remedy, and two hours after; and beſides, you muſt walk him abroad Morning and Evening for the ſpace of an hour. But tho the Horſe have ſtrength to undergo this Evacuation, and tho' none of his noble Parts be conſum'd, I cannot po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſure you that he will be cur'd of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> if there be a great Ulcer; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will not die ſo quickly.</p>
                     <p>Eight days after, if the <hi>Running at the Noſe</hi> ſtill continue, repeat the uſe of the above-mention'd Remedy, and endeavour to ripen the <hi>Kernel</hi> or <hi>Gland,</hi> by applying <hi>Retoires</hi> (or Medicines to break the Skin) and convenient <hi>Plaiſters</hi> or <hi>Fultiſſes,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Ointment</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter; or take it off with an <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>potential C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>tery.</hi> The <hi>actual Cautery</hi> is a red hot Iron, which muſt be apply'd to the <hi>Kernel;</hi> and the <hi>potential Cautery</hi> is that which is commonly call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Inſtead of the <hi>potential Cautery,</hi> you may open the <hi>Kernel</hi> to the middle with a Lance, and after it has done Bleeding, thruſt the quantity of a Bean of <hi>Arſenic,</hi> wrap'd in a piece of Paper to the bottom of the Hole, which muſt be ſtop'd with Cotton. About the fifth or ſixth day the Matter will begin to come out, and after the ninth or tenth a Scab will fall off, reſembling the Kernel of a Nut. If there remain any Impurity or foul Fleſh, keep the hole open as long as you can with the <hi>Ointment Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiacum</hi> mix'd with <hi>red Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>I have propos'd all theſe Reſolving Medicines for the ſatisfaction and inſtruction of the Curious; but if the <hi>Kernel</hi> be very hard, and faſten'd to the Jaw-bone, it will hardly yield to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179659:245"/>theſe Remedies: For beſides the inconveniency of the part for the application of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, they are not always attended with the expected Succeſs. The beſt way then, in my Opinion, is to ſoften the <hi>Kernel,</hi> and to apply either a red-hot Iron, or <hi>potential Cautery</hi> made of <hi>Arſenic, Sublimate,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Cauſtic.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho' the uſual <hi>ſoftening</hi> Remedies are not very efrectual, yet there are ſome more proper in this caſe than others; and you may confidently uſe that which follows, for in the beginning it may reſolve the <hi>Kernel</hi> before it grow to an extream hardneſs. I have try'd it, and found it effectual.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>When you undertake the Cure of a Horſe that is ſeiz'd with the <hi>Glanders,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies here preſcrib'd, together with ſuch as are given inwardly, ought either to <hi>reſolve</hi> part of the <hi>Kernel,</hi> or bring it to <hi>Suppuration;</hi> and then you may conclude that the Remedy works well, and aſſaults the cauſe of the Diſeaſe; ſince the <hi>Gland</hi> is leſſen'd and becomes more moveable, and whereas it was <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>large</hi> before, is now either <hi>little, ſoft,</hi> or <hi>looſe,</hi> for 'tis a very good ſign, when the Remedies that are us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d produce any one of theſe Effects. But you muſt not flatter your ſelf with hopes of Succeſs, tho' (as it happens not unfrequently) the <hi>Kernel</hi> ſhould be conſiderably diminiſh'd during the <hi>Wane of the Moon,</hi> and even without the application of any Remedies; for in the next <hi>Encreaſe of the Moon,</hi> it will grow as bad as ever, and even ſometimes harder and more fix'd than it was before. And therefore when you ſee it decreaſe in the <hi>Wane of the Moon,</hi> you muſt let the next <hi>New-Moon</hi> be paſt, before you adventure to give any hope of a Cure.</p>
                     <p>The cure of this Diſeaſe is uſually begun where it ought to be ended; for as ſoon as a Horſe is ſeiz'd with it, the firſt thing his Maſter deſires, and the Farrier propoſes to be done in order to the Cure, is to take off the <hi>Kernel,</hi> but they ought to conſider that the <hi>Kernel</hi> is the <hi>Effect,</hi> not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> and that the removal of that can never reſtore the Horſe to his wonted Health. And <hi>Experience,</hi> as well as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> has couvinc'd me of the prepoſterouſneſs of this Method; for I caus'd the <hi>Kernel</hi> to be thrice cut out of the ſame Horſe, and after all could not perfect the Cure, tho' I gave him ſeveral good Remedies beſides.</p>
                     <p>But when 'tis convenient to take out the <hi>Kernel,</hi> you muſt obſerve the following Directions. In the firſt place, you muſt caſt the Horſe, and having open'd the Skin that covers the <hi>Kernel,</hi> tye two threads to it to keep the Wounds open during the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Then, without any Inſtrument, take hold of the <hi>Kernel</hi> with your Thumb, and ſeparate it from the Bone; for the cutting of any of the Veins that nouriſh it, would cauſe a Flux of Blood, which you could not eaſily ſtop: But if it ſtick ſo faſt that you cannot looſen it with your Thumb, or if you perceive ſome Vein that muſt neceſſarily be cut, you muſt carefully tye it with a Thread before you make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to prevent a Flux of Blood, and proceed to ſeparate it gently till it be wholly looſen'd from the Bone: After which you muſt tye all the Veſſels that nouriſh it, and faſten it to the Bone, and then cut off the whoſe <hi>Kernel</hi> which is a Maſs compos'd of a great number of ſmall <hi>Glands.</hi> The Operation being thus perform'd, wipe the part very clean from Blood and all manner of moiſture, and touch it every where with a Penſil dip'd in good <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> which will ſear the orifices of the Veſſels that moiſten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, fed, and fomented the <hi>Kernel,</hi> and produce a ſort of Scurf which will leave a Scar ſufficient to ſtop the courſe of the Humours, and prevent the growing again of the <hi>Kernel</hi> for ſome time. Then fill the empty ſpace under the Bone with fine Flax,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179659:245"/>moiſten'd with ſtrong and truly prepar'd <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> and tie on the Bandage with the Threads I order'd you to faſten when you cut the Skin. And afterwards you muſt take care to conſume the Fleſh as it grows; for the Hole will be quickly fill'd with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or rather with ſpongy Fleſh, which will ſtill be apt to produce new Kernels, or at leaſt to fill up the void Space, if you do not keep the Hole open till the Cure be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by thruſting in Flax anointed with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> to preſerve the hollow Space between the Jaw-Bones. And even if need require, you may rub the Part again with a Pencil dipt in <hi>Oil</hi> not <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> for the former is more effectual, and a ſtronger Corroſive than the latter. Nor muſt you forget, every time you dreſs the Sore, to waſh it with luke-warm Wine, till it be heal'd. Thus you may cut out the <hi>Kernel,</hi> when you cannot diſſolve it: and I ſaw one ſo extremely hard, that we could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it with a Hatchet, after it was taken out of the place where it ſtuck.</p>
                     <p>If (as it ſometimes happens) the <hi>Kernel</hi> grow again after it has been ſeveral times cut out, you may reaſonably deſpair of the Succeſs of that Method; for if you do not attack the Diſcaſe with inward Medicines, it will never be cur'd. And even tho' after the Operation you rub the Wound with <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi> and take care not to leave the leaſt part of the <hi>Kernel,</hi> which wou'd quickly breed another as big as the former; tho', I ſay, the Kernel be wholly extirpated, without the leaſt appearance of its growing again, you muſt not conclude poſitively that the Danger is over, for the preſent good Poſture of Affairs may be only the Effect of the <hi>Wane of the Moon:</hi> but if the <hi>Kernel</hi> does not appear again in the next <hi>growing Moon,</hi> you may reaſonably ſuppoſe that your Remedy has taken Effect; for ſince the Matter that nouriſhes the <hi>Kernel</hi> is voided by the Noſtrils, during the <hi>Wane,</hi> 'tis plain that the Swelling muſt be leſſen'd at that time, as, for the contrary Reaſon, it muſt recover its former Bigneſs during the next <hi>Increaſe of the Moon.</hi> I have already ſhow'd that the Matter which is diſcharg'd by the Noſtrils proceeds not immediately from the <hi>Brain,</hi> but from the <hi>Lungs, Liver,</hi> and <hi>Spleen,</hi> and aſcends either by the <hi>Gullet</hi> or Paſſages of <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> to a little Cavity between the Jaw-Bones, from whence it breaks forth; and if its Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity be ſo great that it cannot be wholly voided by the Noſe, forms <hi>Kernels,</hi> which are greater or ſmaller, according to the Abundance of the Matter. 'Tis plain from this Account, that 'tis in vain to cut out the <hi>Kernel,</hi> till you perceive that the Horſe voids leſs Matter, and is in a hopeful way of Cure by the Uſe of good Remedies. They who are acquainted with the <hi>Anatomy of a Horſe</hi> will be ſoon convinc'd of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That the Matter riſes from below to the little Cavity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jaw-Bones: And beſides 'tis abſurd to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Brain</hi> is able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſo great a Quantity of Matter as that which continually flows from the <hi>Noſtrils;</hi> but we may eaſily conceive that it turns the Matter it receives by the above-mention'd Paſſages, to a ſharp and thin Liquor, which falls upon the Parts that are already vitiated by the preternatural Heat, and oftentimes by an Ulcer: And therefore 'tis neceſſary in order to the Cure of thoſe Parts, to prevent their ſending up to the <hi>Brain</hi> theſe malignant <hi>Vapours,</hi> which being chang'd into <hi>Water,</hi> fall down again, and cauſe all the Diſordrs that uſually accompany this Diſeaſe. This Diſcourſe will perhaps ſeem tedious to thoſe who deſire only to be inform'd of a ſure Remedy to cure their Horſes: I aſſure 'em that I wou'd very willingly ſatisfie 'em if I could; but I have never yet met with any ſuch Remedy. However they may try thoſe which follow, and perhaps may find 'em effectual; but I will not pretend to warrant their Succeſs.</p>

                        <p>This Diſeaſe is not always cur'd by the cutting out of the <hi>Kernel;</hi> nor by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy I intend to preſcribe for the Evacuation of the Matter, which only expels that part of it which is already in Motion, and on the way, without removing the Cauſe: and therefore I ſhall propoſe another that is more effectual, and will perfect the Cure, if the Diſeaſe be capable of receiving any; but I think fit to begin with the former, becauſe it may ſometimes be able to conquer a leſs malignant ſort of <hi>Glanders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, you muſt <hi>take up</hi> the two <hi>Neck-Veins,</hi> two fingers breadth beneath the uſual <hi>Bleeding-Place,</hi> as I order'd before: then take an Ounce of <hi>Brazal Tabacco,</hi> cut ſmall, as 'tis commonly prepar'd for Smoaking; infuſe it ſix hours in a Quart of good <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and gently ſtrain it thro' a Clout, throwing away the <hi>Tabacco.</hi> Let your Horſe ſtand four hours bridl'd in the Morning, then inject half a Glaſs of this Remedy into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179659:246"/>his Noſtrils; aſſoon as he has taken it, walk him him a Quarter of an hour in your hand, and afterwards let him ſtand two hours bridl'd.</p>
                        <p>If notwithſtanding this Remedy, he continue to eat his Meat with the ſame Appetite as before, repeat the ſame next Morning, and for ſome days after augment the Doſe by degrees, till you judge it ſtrong enough to cauſe a plentiful Evacuation. Continue to repeat the ſame every Morning, or only every ſecond, third or fourth Day, if he caſt forth Abundance of Matter, or be troubl'd with a violent <hi>Beating</hi> in his <hi>Flank,</hi> or <hi>loſe</hi> his <hi>Appetite,</hi> till the Cure be compleated, which will happen in a Month or five Weeks. But in preſcribing this Method, I ſuppoſe that the Remedy does not make him forſake his Meat; for if it has that Effect, you muſt not give it him next Morning, but wait till he has recover'd his Appetite, and then give him another Doſe.</p>
                        <p>If this Remedy work too violently, and cauſe too great an Agitation in the Horſe's Body, infuſe two Ounces of <hi>Tabacco</hi> in a Quart of <hi>Oil-Olive;</hi> let it ſtand in hot Aſhes all Night, and in the Morning ſtrain out a Glaſs-full, which you muſt give him luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, one half at each Noſtril. This is a gentler Medicine, and beſides that it will make him void ſome Matter, it allays the ſharpneſs of the Humours: but you muſt obſerve the ſame Directions as before, concerning <hi>Beating in the Flank,</hi> and <hi>Loſs of Appetite.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You muſt take care to augment or diminiſh the Doſe, according to the good or bad Condition of the Horſe's <hi>Appetite,</hi> and the great or ſmall Quantity of the Matter which he voids.</p>
                        <p>Nature oftentimes heals thoſe internal <hi>Ulcers,</hi> which are the Source of the filthy Matter that runs out of the Noſe, when by a great Evacuation ſhe is eas'd of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſharp and malignant Humours that foment the Diſtemper. The Cure of an <hi>Ulcer</hi> conſiſts wholly in <hi>cleanſing</hi> it; for you may commit the <hi>healing</hi> of it to Nature.</p>
                        <p>This Remedy will expel a prodigious Quantity of Matter: ſome Horſes bear it well without loſing their <hi>Appetite,</hi> and even the <hi>Kernel</hi> diſappears in the <hi>Wane of the Moon;</hi> but if it grow again, you muſt repeat the Medicine.</p>
                        <p>If after a long Continuance in this Method, the Horſe begins to void leſs Matter, and according to all Probability, the Flux of Matter will quickly ceaſe, forbear the Uſe of the Remedy for ſome Days; and if the Evacuation be wholly ſtopt, (as it ſometimes happens) give him a Doſe of the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> for three Days together, in a Quart of <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red Wine;</hi> after which the Kernel will (perhaps) return no more, and the Horſe will perfectly recover.</p>
                        <p>I have given this Remedy to ſome Horſes, who were not at all troubl'd with a <hi>beating in the Flank</hi> after the taking of it, nor loſt the leaſt ſtroak of their Teeth: they were cur'd for ſome time, but afterwards ſome of 'em relaps'd into their former Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>When the the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which are the uſual Seat of this Diſtemper, are much waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Diſeaſe is incurable, and the above-mention'd Remedy haſtens the Horſe's Death: but ſince 'tis impoſſible to ſave him, the beſt Way is to diſpatch him ſpeedily.</p>
                        <p>When you undertake the Cure of this Diſtemper, whatever Remedy you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to uſe, you ought always during the <hi>Encreaſe of the Moon,</hi> to ſtrengthen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and help her by gentle Methods, to caſt forth the Matter that offends her; for which Purpoſe repeated Doſes of the <hi>Cordial Powder, Treacle, Electuary of Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> and the <hi>Cordial Pills</hi> are very effectual: And during the <hi>Wane,</hi> you muſt <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe</hi> the <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> and give Remedies to promote the Evacuation of the Matter. This Method ſeems to promiſe good Effects; but I will not poſitively warrant the Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Perfumes</hi> are not very proper in this Caſe: 'tis true they expel a great deal of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and even without Violence; but they make the Horſe too lean and dry, and ſpoil his Appetite.</p>

                     <p>TAke <hi>Betony, Vervain, Mugwort, Speedwell, Bawm, Wormwood, Scabious, Agrimony, Mint, Hyſſop,</hi> and <hi>Sage;</hi> burn 'em in a Chafing-diſh, and putting a Bag with a Hole in it about the Horſe's Head, make him receive the Smoak into his Noſtrils for a quarter of an Hour, which will expel abundance of Matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>wild Vine</hi> that grows in the Hedges, call'd <hi>black Briony,</hi> ſlic'd ſmall while 'tis green, and afterwards beaten, caſts forth a Smell that will make the Horſe void a great deal of Matter. Some ſay it hurts the Sight, but Experience will convince you of the contrary: It has moſt Virtue when it bears its Flower.</p>
                     <p>To declare my Opinion ingenuouſly, I never obſerv'd any Horſes to receive great Benefit by <hi>Perſumes;</hi> but I was willing to inſert 'em here for the Satisfaction of ſome Perſons. The <hi>Syringe</hi> makes <hi>Perſumes</hi> and even <hi>Feathers</hi> uſeleſs, and ſpoils not the Horſe's Appetite: but ſince Farriers are very fond of theſe Medicines, and continually propoſe the Uſe of 'em; I thought fit to deſcribe the beſt that can be made, tho' even that is not very effectual, and I dare not adviſe you to uſe it.</p>
                     <p>During the Uſe of theſe Remedies, keep the Horſe to a <hi>moiſtening Diet,</hi> which faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates the Evacuations you are oblig'd to procure. Some diſlike <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>Oats:</hi> but I always found <hi>Bran</hi> to be the moſt proper Food, for <hi>Oats</hi> give Nature too much trouble to digeſt 'em.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen Horſes void Matter at the Noſe ſix Years together, and yet during all that time perform their wonted Service; hunt, eat, and undergo Fatigues like other Horſes: The Uſe of Remedies was laid aſide, they were not kept to any Diet, and the the whole Buſineſs of the Cure was left to Nature; but at laſt the Diſeaſe carry'd 'em off.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo ſeen others (tho' very few) who cou'd not be cur'd by Medicines, and yet, ſometime after the Uſe of Remedies and Hope of Cure were both laid aſide, they recover'd their perfect Health.</p>

                     <p>TAke a Pot large enough to hold five Pints or three Quarts, fill it a third part full with the ſecond Bark of the <hi>Aller</hi> or <hi>Alder-Tree,</hi> which grows in watery Places, and ſerves to make Stools, Ladders, and other Utenſils of ſmall Value: ſcrape the Bark or cut it ſmall, and, having added two Quarts of Water, boil it to the Conſumption of one half, ſtirring it from time to time; then add another Quart of Water to that which remains, and boil away that alſo; after which add another Quart, and conſume that too: then preſs out the remaining Quart, and diſſolve in the ſtrain'd Liquor half a Pound of <hi>Oil-Olive;</hi> pour out half a Pint of the Liquor thus mix'd, and give the reſt to the Horſe to drink luke-warm; then inject the other half Pint into his Noſtrils, and afterwards walk him abroad in his Cloaths for half an hour. This Remedy will draw forth Abundance of Matter; and tho' he only voided Matter at one Noſtril before, it will make him run at both: If the Horſe be not cur'd eight Days after, repeat the ſame Remedy, and perhaps he will recover. I have both cur'd ſome Horſes with this Medicine, and us'd it ſeveral times without any Succeſs at all; but it never produces any dangerous Effects. If this do not cure the Horſe, <hi>take up</hi> his two <hi>Neck-Veins,</hi> and afterwards give him a Doſe of the <hi>Cordial Pills</hi> four Days together, which will either cure him, or you may conclude him to be paſt Recovery.</p>

                        <p>Take of <hi>Oriental Caſter</hi> groſly beaten, an Ounce, <hi>Gentian</hi> beaten, and <hi>Savin</hi> ſlic'd ſmall, of each an Ounce and a half: boil them in five Quarts of ſtrong <hi>Vinegar</hi> to three, and after the Liquor is cold, ſtrain it thro' a Linnen Cloth.</p>
                        <p>Give the Horſe a Quart of this Liquor after he has ſtood bridl'd three Hours; then cover him, and put him in the Stable: when the Remedy works he will be very ſick, his <hi>Flank</hi> will <hi>beat,</hi> and ſometimes he will be ſeiz'd with a <hi>Trembling</hi> all over his Body: if he offer to lie down, do not hinder him, for he will riſe again in a little time. Two Hours after the taking of the Remedy walk him half an Hour, and if you obſerve that he voids part of his <hi>Lungs</hi> at the Mouth, as it ſometimes happens with Coughing, you may conclude the Diſeaſe to be incurable, and diſpatch him ſpeedily; but if he only run at the Noſtrils, provided he do not void Blood or green Matter, you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſpair. Aſſoon as he has recover'd his Appetite, as you may expect he will after the Space of one or two, and ſometimes three Days, give him another Quart in the Morning, obſerving the ſame Directions as before; and after he begins again to feed heartily, give him the third Quart, ordering him as at the firſt. After which lead him abroad every Morning for half an Hour; and if he be in a way of Recovery, the <hi>Running at the Noſe</hi> will diminiſh by degrees, and at laſt totally ceaſe. If after he has receiv'd one Doſe, he caſt forth <hi>greeniſh Matter,</hi> 'tis a very dangerous Sign, and in all probability the Horſe will never recover.</p>
                        <p>This Receipt has cur'd ſome Horſes that were thought to have the <hi>Glanders;</hi> many received no Benefit by it, and it has kill'd others whoſe <hi>Lungs</hi> were ſo totally corrupted that they could not poſſibly have liv'd long, and therefore their Maſters were well rid of 'em.</p>
                        <p>There is a great affinity between the <hi>Glanders</hi> and <hi>Farcin;</hi> and the <hi>latter,</hi> when 'tis paſt Remedy, degenerates into the <hi>former;</hi> which, in that caſe, is abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>

                     <p>You may alſo make <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> by letting it ſtand four and twenty Hours in a Cup of <hi>Regulus of Antimony,</hi> which will ſerve perpetually, if you take care after every Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Or you may put two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Powder, in a three Quart Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle full of <hi>White-Wine</hi> or <hi>Claret;</hi> after four and twenty Hours you may take out five half Pints, and fill up the Bottle with freſh Wine, and by taking out and filling up the ſame quantity conſtantly, you may have freſh <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> every day in the Year, without any other Charge than that of the Wine.

                     <p>The <hi>Angelical Powder</hi> will alſo produce the ſame effect, and a great deal better than any other Preparation of <hi>Antimony;</hi> you muſt put an Ounce of it to three Quarts of Wine. Thus you ſee <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> is not very chargeable; and I can aſſure you 'tis extremely uſeful.</p>
                     <p>The continu'd uſe of this Wine purifies the Blood, reſiſts Corruption, preſerves the <hi>Wind,</hi> by opening and clearing the Paſſages of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> keeps the Horſe in perfect Health, and prevents Sickneſs.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:179659:247"/>
                     <p>In thoſe Countries where <hi>Wine</hi> is ſcarce and <hi>Beer</hi> common, you may uſe the latter inſtead of the former, in all the Preparations of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which I order to be made with <hi>Wine;</hi> for it will alſo grow <hi>Emetic,</hi> and produce very good Effects; and there cannot be a better Liquor for <hi>Clyſters</hi> than <hi>Emetic Beer,</hi> to which you may add any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ingredients, as you do to the uſual Decoctions.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Glanders</hi> with a very uſeful Remark. You muſt obſerve, during the Cure, whether your Horſe thrives and grows fat, which is a very good ſign; for if the <hi>Lungs</hi> were waſted, he would certainly pine away. And therefore when you obſerve this, you may entertain ſome hope of his Recovery; but you muſt not be diſcourag'd by the tediouſneſs of the Cure, for two or three Months are quickly paſt, and the Cure is ſeldom perfected ſo ſoon.</p>
                     <p>It may be very uſeful to give a Horſe that has been long tormented with Medicines, a Quart of <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> with a Horn, and to inject half a Pint of the ſame Liquor into his Noſtrils, continuing after the ſame manner thirty days.</p>
                     <p>If during that time he void abundance of Matter at the <hi>Eyes,</hi> like to that which he vents at his <hi>Noſe,</hi> you may conclude the Diſeaſe to be incurable, eſpecially if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to run at the <hi>Eyes</hi> eight or ten days.</p>
                     <p>If while the Horſe is under Cure, you obſerve any <hi>Knots</hi> of the <hi>Farcin</hi> to break forth upon his Body, tho' they may be eaſily cur'd, and the <hi>Farcin</hi> be not malignant, yet the Horſe will never recover.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing wanting to compleat this Account of the <hi>Glanders,</hi> but a ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to cure it; which, I muſt confeſs, I could never find, neither do I believe it can be found: But oftentimes a Horſe is groundleſly ſuſpected to have the <hi>Glanders.</hi> When I ſay <hi>Glanders,</hi> I mean that which is incurable, which cannot be diſtinguiſh'd from the leſs malignant Kinds, till you find it will not yield to the beſt Remedies; in which caſe you may confidently pronounce it to be incurable. And therefore you muſt always attempt the Cure, leſt you be afterwards troubl'd to think that a Horſe of value has periſh'd by your neglect, giving credit too eaſily to the Opinion of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Pretenders.</p>

                     <p>ALL Mortal Diſeaſes, which Farriers do not underſtand, are, in <hi>France,</hi> call'd <hi>Diſtempers of the Head,</hi> among which there are ſome that reſemble the <hi>Jaundice</hi> in Men, and are very fatal and pernicious. To give you a diſtinct Idea of 'em, you muſt know that they proceed from an Inundation of <hi>Choler,</hi> which affects the principal parts of the Body. That which floats in the <hi>Stomach</hi> deſtroys the Appetite and ſpoils Digeſtion, that which is lodg'd in the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> cauſes a Fever, which quickly proves Mortal; and that which is carry'd to the <hi>Head</hi> diſturbs all the Functions that are perform'd there, which makes the Horſe go heavily, and renders him dull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, and benum'd.</p>
                     <p>If you let a Horſe Blood while he is in this condition, as ſoon as it grows Cold you will perceive it to be yellow on the ſurface, and the Water that ſwims on the top will be red and yellowiſh, which is a certain ſign of the redundancy of <hi>Choler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The inſide of his <hi>Lips</hi> is <hi>yellow;</hi> and his <hi>Eyes</hi> are infected with the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>'Tis call'd <hi>Gelbeſucht,</hi> or the <hi>yellow Diſeaſe,</hi> by the <hi>Germans,</hi> who are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it than we, and have invented a Remedy for it, which a Farrier of that Nation ſold for a great Summ of Money to a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who communicated it to me, and I found it (by experience) to be very effectual; for when I try'd it, this was the only Diſeaſe of the Head that was known. But ſince that time the Diſtemper has chang'd its Nature, and the alteration of the Cauſe oblig'd us to ſearch for new Remedies, tho' to little purpoſe. When a Horſe is ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper he eats faintly, hangs his Head and Ears, his Eye is languid, his Noſtrils open, and he is apt to ſtumble. If theſe Signs do not appear, the following Remedy will produce no
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179659:248"/>effect; for all Diſeaſes of the Head proceed not from the ſame Cauſe, and you will never be able, by this Method, to remove a Diſtemper that is not caus'd by the <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of Choler.</hi> The Diſeaſes that were known by this Name in the Year; 166<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. and 1661. and thoſe of 1669, 1670. and the ſucceeding Years, were not produc'd by the above-mention'd Cauſe, and therefore could not be cur'd by the <hi>German</hi> Remedy; nor could we find any other ſucceſsful Medicine, for more Horſes died than were cur'd, of thoſe Diſeaſes. Nevertheleſs I have lately adminiſter'd a Remedy in <hi>Thea</hi> with excellent Succeſs, by the uſe of which ſeveral Horſes have been cur'd of thoſe late contagious Diſtempers that were commonly call'd <hi>Diſeaſes of the Head.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the <hi>overflowing of the Bile</hi> is as follows.</p>
                     <p>Take four Quarts of Spring or River Water, and make a <hi>Lye,</hi> with about half a Buſhel of <hi>Aſhes of Vine-Twigs,</hi> by pouring the boiling Water four ſeveral times upon the Aſhes, then add a pound of good <hi>Oil Olive,</hi> and a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries</hi> in Powder.</p>
                     <p>Let the Horſe be kept all Night Bridl'd, in the Morning let him Blood plentifully in the <hi>Flank,</hi> and two hours after give him two Glaſſes of the Remedy at the Noſtrils; let the Bridle remain on his Head two hours longer, then unbridle him, and give him ſome <hi>White-Water</hi> to drink, and either <hi>moiſten'd Bran, Hay,</hi> or <hi>Bread</hi> to eat; after he has fed a quarter of an Hour Bridle him again, and let him ſtand two hours, after which give him a Glaſs of the Remedy at each Noſtril; two hours after unbridle him, and ſuffer him to eat and drink a quarter of an Hour, as before. Continue after the ſame manner to give him two Glaſſes of the Medicine every four hours, unbridling him a quarter of an Hour, between every two Doſes, till you have us'd the whole Compoſition.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy makes the Horſe caſt forth Water and Snot at the Noſe, but it only appeaſes or quels the Diſtemper without removing the Cauſe: For the <hi>Fix'd Salt</hi> of the <hi>Aſhes</hi> being communicated to the <hi>Lye</hi> deſtroys the <hi>Acid</hi> that occaſion'd theſe Diſorders, and produc'd the Heat with which this Diſeaſe is accompani'd; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Oil</hi> contributes very much to qualifie the Diſtemper, as you may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the making of <hi>Soap.</hi> Afterwards leave the Horſe in a dark place, with good Litter, and free from the noiſe of Men or Horſes, that he may Sleep, for in this caſe <hi>Reſt</hi> is the Sovereign Remedy.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you perceive that he has perfectly recover'd his <hi>Appetite,</hi> walk him gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the cool of the day, about a quarter of an Hour, for ſeven or eight days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and then purge him with the Medicine deſcrib'd in the Twenty Sixth Chapter.</p>

                     <p>THE Diſtempers that are at preſent known by that Name, are not caus'd by the <hi>overflowing of Choler;</hi> but, tho' there is but little hope of Cure, we ought not wholly to abandon the ſick Horſes: For 'tis ſome ſatisfaction to endeavour to give 'em eaſe, tho' they are ſeldom fit for Service afterward. As ſoon as you ſuſpect the Horſe to be ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper give him a Doſe of the <hi>Lieutenant's-Powder,</hi> or of the <hi>Cerdial Pills,</hi> which have a vertue to reſiſt the Poyſon that Suffocates 'em, and not unfrequently Cures 'em perfectly in a little time: And thoſe who are cur'd by this Method are as fit for Service as formerly. And even by way of prevention you ought to give the ſame Powder or Balls to all your Horſes, and repeat 'em after three days; for they who have taken theſe Remedies will certainly eſcape falling into this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. Beſides, you muſt perfume the whole Stable, and change the Pails, Shovels, Forks, Curry-Combs, and all the Furniture of the Stable. But if the Horſe has been ſick for ſome time, it will be convenient to try other Remedies: for the Powder is only proper in the beginning, and has no effect after the Diſeaſe has laſted four and twenty Hours.</p>
                     <p>Take the bigneſs of the Tag of a Point of good black <hi>Hellebore,</hi> open the Skin on the Horſe's Breaſt, and put the piece of <hi>Hellebore</hi> between the Skin and the Fleſh, ſo that it may not fall out: It will make the part ſwell as big as your Hat, and draw

Take of the Herb call'd <hi>Devil's-Bit,</hi> and <hi>Fumitory,</hi> of each one Handful, <hi>Cummin</hi>-ſeed one Ounce, <hi>Aſſa-faetida</hi> half an Ounce, <hi>Strong Beer</hi> or <hi>White-Wine</hi> a Quart, put 'em into a Pot cover'd cloſe with a Hog's-Bladder and Paper, and the Lid of the Pot over all: Fit the Pot to the <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> that is, place it in a Kettle with a Straw-Rope between the bottom of the Pot and the Kettle; then pour Water into the Kettle, till it riſe within an Inch of the top of the Pot, and make the Water boil an hour over a ſtrong Fire; after which take out the Pot, and when 'tis ſomewhat cold uncover it, ſtrain out the Liquor, and make the Horſe drink it Blood-warm two or three hours after his Bleeding; then let him ſtand four hours Bridl'd, and at Night give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> with <hi>Sal Polycreſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next Morning Bridle your Horſe, and pour a Quart of ſtrong <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>White-Wine</hi> upon the groſs ſubſtance that remain'd in the the Pot; cover it as before, and ſet it over a gentle Fire, augmenting the Fire by degrees till it begin to boil: Keep it boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hour over a naked Fire, and not in a Kettle as before. After 'tis half cold, preſs out the Liquor as hard as you can, and throwing away the thick ſubſtance, give the Liquor to the Horſe to drink, keeping him Bridl'd four hours after: Then give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and luke-warm Water to drink, and in the Evening, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clyſter.</hi>

                        <p>I propoſe this Remedy for thoſe Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head,</hi> which continu'd to infeſt ſome Horſes in the Year 1672. and it will certainly ſucceed if you reſiſt the Diſeaſe in the beginning; but if the Diſtemper has made any progreſs, it will not yield to this Remedy: And therefore you muſt prepare the Medicine as ſoon as you have the leaſt ſuſpicion that your Horſe is ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper; for 'tis better to make it in vain four times, than once to neglect the opportunity of making it, ſince it always produces ſome good effects.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon then as you perceive the leaſt ſign of this Diſeaſe: For example, if the Horſe be dull, heavy, and refuſe his Oats, give him an Ounce of burnt <hi>Allom,</hi> in Powder, with an Ounce of <hi>Salt of Glaſs,</hi> or <hi>Axungia vitri,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sugar-Candy</hi> in a Quart of <hi>White,</hi> or (which is better) <hi>Spaniſh-Wine:</hi> Then keep him Bridl'd two Hours, after which unbridle him; and you will certainly find him free of the Diſtemper.</p>
                        <p>And even tho' he be not troubl'd with that Diſeaſe, this Remedy will do him good by conſuming the <hi>Phlegm</hi> in his Stomach, and giving him a good <hi>Appetite.</hi>

                     <p>HItherto there have been but few good Remedies preſcrib'd for the Diſeaſe of the Head, call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, (I know not why) the <hi>Spaniſh-Evil.</hi> You may know it by the Horſe's ſtaggering or reeling as he goes, which is caus'd by the motion of the Vapours in their aſcent to the Brain, which make him ſo giddy that he cannot walk ſtraight forward: Beſides, he has a ſtrong averſion to his Meat, his Mouth burns, his Heart and Flanks beat violently; and by viewing him attentively you may eaſily perceive, that he ſuffers extreamly, and can hardly eſcape without timely aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Take one of thoſe Beer-Glaſſes, which are very large and yellow, reduce it to Powder, and ſtrain it thro' a fine ſearce: Or rather (which is far more effectual) take four Ounces of <hi>Salt of Glaſs,</hi> which is white, and may be found in <hi>Druggiſts</hi>-Shops, beat it very ſmall, and afterwards beat a handful of <hi>Salt;</hi> mix 'em with three Pints of <hi>Cordial-Water</hi> in a Pot, and heat 'em till the Salt be diſſolv'd, that is, as much of it as can be diſſolv'd: The common <hi>Salt</hi> will open the Body of the <hi>Salt of Glaſs,</hi> and make the <hi>Cordial-Water</hi> penetrate it, for <hi>Salts</hi> do not act unleſs they be diſſolv'd. Then ſtrain out the Liquor, and while it boils infuſe in it two Ounces of good and freſh <hi>Thea,</hi> for ſix or eight Hours, during which time you muſt keep the Water luke-warm: Strain again, and throwing away the <hi>Thea</hi> as uſeleſs, keep the Water that is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the <hi>Salt,</hi> and with the Tincture of the <hi>Thea.</hi> Afterwards give the whole quantity of the Liquor to the Horſe, pouring it into his Throat with a Horn, then cover him, and keep him three Hours Bridl'd in the Stable.</p>
                     <p>If the firſt Doſe do not cure him, give him another four and twenty Hours after, and every day inject a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of two Quarts of <hi>Emetic Beer,</hi> or inſtead of that, take an Ounce of <hi>Sal Polycreſt,</hi> as much <hi>Coloquintida</hi> ſlic'd ſmall, two Drams of <hi>Anni-ſeeds</hi> beaten, and two Quarts of <hi>Beer;</hi> mix 'em, and let 'em ſtand in Infuſion ſix hours on hot Aſhes, then boil 'em a little, ſtrain, and adding a quarter of a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> inject it luke-warm.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of Malignity in this Diſtemper, for 'tis accompani'd with a <hi>preternatural</hi> Heat, which deſtroys that which is <hi>natural;</hi> and oftentimes before a Man thinks of giving this Remedy, ſome noble Part is ſeiz'd with ſo violent an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Fire cannot afterwards be extinguiſh'd till the whole part is conſum'd, which fatal event may be occaſion'd by the neglect of one day. Thus the Horſe's Death muſt not be imputed to the inſufficiency of the Remedy, which is certainly very effectual, but to the untimely application of it. By virtue of the <hi>Fix'd Salts,</hi> of which it is compos'd, it puts a ſtop to the ſubtilty, or (if I may uſe that expreſſion) the great <hi>Volatility</hi> of the ſharp and ſubtle Spirits, which, by reaſon of their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are carri'd to the Brain, and by their malignant and poyſonous ſharpneſs, change and vitiate its Subſtance. And ſince a <hi>Fix'd Salt,</hi> when 'tis ſtronger and in greater
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179659:249"/>quantity is able to fix a <hi>volatil Salt,</hi> and unite the ſame to its own Subſtance: the two Salts that compoſe this Remedy will fix thoſe Saline Spirits that riſe with the Vapours, and occaſion all the Diſorders that are obſerv'd in Horſes when they are ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper. This is a very probable <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and I wou'd inſiſt longer upon it, if it cou'd be underſtood without ſome Knowledge in <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> Beſides what I have ſaid concerning the Effect of thoſe <hi>Salts,</hi> they open the Body of the <hi>Thea;</hi> and the Water, by their Aſſiſtance, is impregnated with the <hi>Eſſential Salt</hi> of that Plant, and extracts all its Vertue. 'Tis generally acknowledg'd that <hi>Thea</hi> is of exellent Uſe to ſtrengthen the Brain, when 'tis weaken'd by thoſe volatil, ſharp, and malignant Salts I mention'd before: from whence 'tis plain, that this Remedy muſt infallibly cure the Horſe, if the Diſeaſe be not inveterate. Afterwards you muſt adminiſter good <hi>Clyſters,</hi> give him boil'd Water for his ordinary Drink, and keep him to a ſpare Diet; but if he abſtain wholly from eating, you muſt give him the Remedies deſcrib'd in the VIth. Chapter. Thus I have freely communicated this Secret to the Public, which I'm perſuaded is the only Remedy for thoſe Diſeaſes; for Experience has convinc'd me of its admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Efficacy to quench that unnatural and violent Heat which conſumes the ſick Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe why thoſe Horſes that are cur'd of the Diſeaſes of the Head are never afterwards fit for Service, is the Neglect of Farriers, who take no Care to purge away the offending Matter. For tho' the Diſorders that accompany'd the Diſeaſe are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, there remains a <hi>Ferment,</hi> which may produce very bad Conſequences, if it be not expell'd by good Purging Medicines, ſuch as that which follows.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>A</hi> Purging <hi>Medicine to be given to Horſes after they are cur'd of Diſeaſes of the Head.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take extracted <hi>Caſſia,</hi> four Ounces, <hi>Agaric</hi> two Ounces, fine clear <hi>Scammony</hi> three Drams, Powder of <hi>Rhubarb</hi> ſprinkl'd two or three times with a little <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> two Drams, <hi>Coriander-Seed,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Roman Cammomil</hi> in Powder, of each one Dram, <hi>Maſtich</hi> one Scruple: Reduce the dry Ingredients to Powder, mix 'em with two Pounds of <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> and make 'em up into <hi>Pills</hi> of the Bigneſs of <hi>Tennis-Balls,</hi> which you muſt make the Horſe ſwallow, keeping him bridl'd eight Hours before and ſix af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: waſh his Mouth after 'em with a Quart of <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> or for want of that, of ordinary <hi>Wine;</hi> and walk him half an Hour. About four and twenty Hours after, when he begins to purge, walk him abroad once every two Hours, about a quarter of an Hour, or half an Hour each time, to promote the Purgation.</p>
                        <p>Or you may purge him with the <hi>Pills</hi> call'd <hi>Galen's Smaller Head-Pills:</hi> The Doſe is about two Ounces, in a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If he be not ſufficiently purg'd, aſſoon as the Phyſic leaves working, give him a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> made as before with <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>After you have purg'd him twice, 'tis to be hop'd that he will quickly grow fit for Service; but you muſt bring him to work again by degrees, and give Nature time to recover her ſtrength perfectly, after ſo great a Diſturbance. And in the mean time you may give him an Ounce of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in his <hi>Bran,</hi> every Day for a whole Month; which will purifie the Blood, and compleat the Cure, by conſuming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the offending Humours, and cooling the Parts that may be ſtill a little diſorder'd with the preternatural Heat.</p>
                        <p>Since this Diſeaſe uſually attacks all the Horſes that lodge under one Roof with thoſe whom it firſt ſeiz'd; aſſoon as you ſee any one of the reſt begin to refuſe his Meat, you ought (by way of Prevention) to give him the Medicines prepar'd with <hi>burnt Allom</hi> in Powder, <hi>Salt of Glaſs,</hi> &amp;c. deſcrib'd in the beginning of this Chapter; or you may make him faſt ſix Hours, and afterwards give him a Doſe of the <hi>Lieutenant's Powder,</hi> or two of the <hi>Treacle Balls</hi> in Powder; for one Doſe will certainly prevent the coming of the Diſeaſe, if it be given aſſoon as he begins to forſake his Meat. You may find, in the VIth. Chapter, proper Medicines to reſtore his Appetite.</p>
                        <p>For a Confirmation of the Uſefulneſs of this Method, I might appeal to ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality at <hi>Paris</hi> and in other Places, who have ſeen their Horſes preſerv'd by it, and can teſtifie that after the Uſe of the <hi>Powder</hi> or <hi>Balls,</hi> and the <hi>perfuming</hi> of their Stables, theſe <hi>Diſeaſes of the Head</hi> never enter'd more among their Horſes, tho' for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they loſt almoſt all they kept, by thoſe dangerous Diſtempers. The whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179659:250"/>conſiſts in giving a Doſe of the <hi>Lieutenant's Powder,</hi> or two <hi>Treacle-Balls</hi> in Powder, and repeating the Doſe three days after: and ſince we have ſo few certain Remedies for the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Diſtemper, we ought by no Means to neglect ſo fine a <hi>Preſervative.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of the true Preparation of</hi> Scammony.</head>
                     <p>SInce prepar'd <hi>Scammony</hi> is a common Ingredient in <hi>purging</hi> Medicines, I thought fit to inſert a Preparation of it, which is better than <hi>Diagridium,</hi> and therefore may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to Herſes, ſince that is familiarly us'd by Men.</p>
                     <p>Beat the <hi>Scammony</hi> to fine Powder, and ſpread it on brown Paper; then kindle ſome <hi>Brimſtone</hi> in a Chafing-Diſh, and hold the Paper with the <hi>Scammony</hi> over it, that it may receive the Fumes of the <hi>Brimſtone;</hi> caſt new Pieces of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> into the Chaſing-Diſh, one after another for a quarter of an Hour, ſtirring the <hi>Scammony</hi> continually, that it may not ſtick to the Paper, as it will do if you put too much Fire into the Chafing-Diſh. Aſſoon as the <hi>Scammony</hi> begins to change its Colour, you may conclude that 'tis duly prepar'd; and this Preparation is the only <hi>purging</hi> Ingredient that enters into the Compoſition of the <hi>Powder</hi> call'd <hi>Cornachini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſince the beſt <hi>Scammony</hi> may be eaſily procur'd at preſent, I do not think it worth the while to give my ſelf the trouble of <hi>preparing</hi> it; for I find that it may be given in <hi>Subſtance</hi> very ſafely, in a fat and unctuous Vehicle, ſuch as <hi>Fat</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> which hinder it from ſticking to the Parts thro' which it paſſes, and from ſpoiling the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Horſes: tho' it muſt be acknowledg'd the Preparation does certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive that the purging Medicine you adminiſter'd to your Horſe, has not ſo much as looſen'd his Body, or made the Excrements ſoft, you may ſafely augment the Doſe of the Ingredients that were preſcrib'd in the <hi>leaſt</hi> Quantity, as being moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſerving to quicken and expel the reſt. They who purge Horſes know not how much they venture; for as <hi>Bleeding</hi> is eſteem'd the boldeſt Operation that can be made on a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, I'm perſwaded that <hi>Purging</hi> is the moſt difficult and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Operation that can be perform'd on the Body of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> and never to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd without unavoidable Neceſſity, ſince 'tis certain that the Motion or Action of a <hi>Purgative</hi> is contrary to Nature, for 'tis <hi>eſſentially</hi> deſtructive, and uſeful only <hi>by Accident.</hi> And beſides the Evacuation even of corrupt Humours, is always attended with a great Expence of Spirits, which weakens the Horſe extremely; and therefore if <hi>Purgation</hi> be not abſolutely neceſſary, the beſt way is to content our ſelves with adminiſtring <hi>Cordial</hi> Medicines, which ſtrengthen Nature, and help her to expel that which offends her, by the uſual Paſſages. 'Tis true, this Method is not agreeable to Humane Bodies; for if a <hi>Cordial</hi> Medicine be given to a Man, while his Bowels are full of Impurities, it will immediately put the Humours into a Fermentation, which may occaſion very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tumults and Commotions, and not unfrequently produce a Fever: But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Horſes</hi> is very different from that of <hi>Men;</hi> for a <hi>Cordial</hi> Remedy is not only more agreeable to 'em than a <hi>Purgative,</hi> but produces the ſame Effects with leſs Danger; for it <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> Nature, whereas Purging <hi>deſtroys</hi> it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Of Diſeaſes of the</hi> Eyes.</head>
                     <p>THE Diſeaſes of the <hi>Eyes</hi> proceed either from a <hi>Rheum,</hi> or from ſome Accident, that is, from Internal or External Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Rheum</hi> or <hi>Defluxion,</hi> is an Inflammation of the Eye, occaſion'd by ſharp and biting Humours, which flow thither and cauſe Heat and Pain. The Eyes appear watry, hot,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179659:250"/>red, and ſwoll'n: and ſince the Defluxion does not uſually come in an Inſtant, you may eaſily obſerve its daily Progreſs.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is caus'd by a <hi>Blow, Hurt,</hi> or <hi>Stripe,</hi> it comes quickly to a Heighth, and you may perceive on the Outſide of the Eye that the Skin is peel'd off. The other Signs are the ſame as in the former Caſe, but this is leſs dangerous, becauſe 'tis not neceſſarily attended with an ill Diſpoſition of the Body.</p>
                     <p>When you are ſatisfy'd that the Diſeaſe is caus'd by a <hi>Defluxion,</hi> you muſt in the next place examine whether it be <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Eye</hi> it ſelf, or be occaſion'd by its <hi>Sympathy</hi> with ſome other Part which alſo is affected; and, when that is cur'd, the Diſtemper of the Eye will vaniſh. For Example, if the <hi>Liver</hi> be too hot, and produce thin and boyling Blood, this may cauſe a Defluxion and Heat in the <hi>Eye,</hi> tho' it be otherwiſe ſound; in which Caſe the Diſtemper of the <hi>Eye</hi> is wholly owing to the <hi>Blood,</hi> which is too hot and thin to afford it ſuitable Nouriſhment, and the ſame may be ſaid of the other Parts. But when the Diſeaſe is <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> the Subſtance of that Part is immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, either by a Defect in its Formation, or for want of Spirits to animate it, or by reaſon of the loſs of part of its Subſtance, which are the moſt dangerous Caſes, and almoſt incurable: for <hi>Rheums</hi> that proceed from <hi>Sympathy</hi> yield to good Medicines; but there are few Remedies to cure a Diſeaſe that is ſeated in the Subſtance of the <hi>Eye;</hi> for which Reaſon thoſe Diſtempers that increaſe and abate according to the Courſe of the Moon, are almoſt always incurable, ſince they are both <hi>Sympathetical</hi> and <hi>Proper; Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical,</hi> becauſe they follow the Courſe of the Moon, and <hi>Proper,</hi> becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of that <hi>Sympathy</hi> is in the <hi>Eye</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But ſince moſt Perſons are not ſo fond of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> as of a ſpeedy <hi>Cure,</hi> you may paſs by theſe Diſtinctions if they ſeem too hard to be underſtood; for the ill Succeſs even of thoſe Remedies that are duly apply'd, will diſcover but too plainly the Nature of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as you undertake the Cure of any Diſeaſe in the <hi>Eye,</hi> you muſt abſolutely forbid any Oats to be given to the Horſe, and only feed him with <hi>moiſten'd Bran;</hi> you muſt alſo take care that he be not wrought hard, nor kept in too hot a Stable; for the great <hi>Heat</hi> of the Stable augments the Diſtemper, as well as extreme <hi>Cold.</hi> If it be a <hi>Rheum,</hi> the Horſe muſt not be let Blood, for <hi>Bleeding</hi> wou'd make him loſe his Eyes; in which reſpect the Method of Cure differs much from that which is convenient for <hi>Men:</hi> for <hi>Rheums</hi> in the Eyes of <hi>Men</hi> are cur'd by Bleeding in the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, whereas the ſame Remedy wou'd make a <hi>Horſe</hi> blind. Afterwards you muſt <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Veins,</hi> thus; Open the Skin over the Vein, ſeparate the Veſſel with a proper Inſtrument, and without taking any Blood out of it, or cutting it, tie a Thread about it, which will ſufficiently divert the too abundant flowing of the Blood that way, which heats the Eye by too much Nouriſhment, and frequently cauſes thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which are obſerv'd in that Part.</p>
                     <p>I have found out an excellent Method to <hi>take up</hi> theſe <hi>Veins</hi> without Inciſion: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ty'd a Cord or String (ſuch as is us'd for the ſame purpoſe in Bleeding) about the Horſe's Neck to make the Veins ſwell, I pierce the Skin above the Vein with a crooked Needle made like a Semicircle, with a ſtrong Thread faſten'd to it, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it under the Vein, make it come forth on the other Side; then I tye the Thread about the Vein with a double Knot, and make another Knot on the ſame Vein, a large Finger's breadth from the former; after which I take up the Vein on the other Side after the ſame manner. This cauſes a little Swelling in the Temple, which may be eaſily remov'd by chafing it every day with <hi>Aqua-Vitae;</hi> and after the Scab, or rather the Thread that ty'd the <hi>Vein</hi> is fall'n off, the Wound will be quickly clos'd up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Trouble. Thus the <hi>Vein</hi> is ſtopp'd without any outward Scar, and you may <hi>take up</hi> more <hi>Veins</hi> in two Hours by this Method, than in a whole Day by <hi>Inciſion;</hi> and beſides the Courſe of the Blood is as effectually ſtopp'd as by the other Way: for I have perform'd this Operation many hundred times, and always with Succeſs. If you deſign to cut the <hi>Sinew</hi> under the <hi>Vein;</hi> ſince you cannot make uſe of the crooked Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, you muſt neceſſarily have recourſe to Inciſion: but if you are afraid to cut the Sinew, as believing it to be too hazardous an Operation, you muſt <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Vein</hi> with the Needle. To conclude; You muſt not be ſurpriz'd tho' the Holes that are made by the Needle ſhou'd bleed a little; for aſſoon as you take the Cord from the Horſe's Neck, the Blood will be immediately ſtopp'd.</p>
                     <p>Under the <hi>Eye-Vein</hi> there is a <hi>Sinew,</hi> which is as big as the <hi>Vein;</hi> after you have found it out, you may ſeparate and cut it; becauſe its Communication with the <hi>Optic Nerve</hi> that furniſhes the <hi>Viſual Spirits</hi> which conſtitute the Faculty of Seeing, is partly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179659:251"/>the Cauſe of <hi>Rheums</hi> and even of the Diſeaſe call'd the <hi>Moon-Eye.</hi> For when the <hi>Opti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Nerve</hi> grows looſe, ſoft, and flaccid, the Spirits that ought to have been carry'd to the Eye, not being able to find a Paſſage that way, are ſtopp'd and diſſipated; ſo that the Eye being depriv'd of its uſual Supplies, grows hot, and if at the ſame time there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be the leaſt Conjunction of any other Cauſe, as the Diſorder, Heat, or Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Blood, immediately a <hi>Rheum</hi> is form'd, which encreaſes or abates ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cauſes that foment it. But aſſoon as you cut this other <hi>Eye-Nerve,</hi> the <hi>Optic-Nerve</hi> with which it communicates, grows immediately ſtiff, the Spirits reſume their wonted Courſe, the Diſeaſe is eaſily cur'd by the Application of proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Eye returns vigorouſly to its former Task: nevertheleſs few Farriers have Courage enough to venture on this Operation, which without any Reaſon they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire a further Confirmation of the Truth of what I have ſaid, you may eaſily ſatisfie your Curioſity, by making the following Experiment on a living Colt of ſmall Value. Separate the Skin from his Head, and you will not only perceive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the two <hi>Nerves</hi> or <hi>Sinews,</hi> but that the <hi>Optic-Nerve</hi> will appear ſtiffer and more ſtretch'd, aſſoon as you cut the other, which you may find without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, tho' it lies deep and near the Bone. But they who dare not venture on this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may content themſelves with <hi>taking up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Vein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'm confident you will not find this Remark in any other Author, and I'm fully ſatisfy'd of its Juſtneſs and Solidity; ſince 'tis not only agreeable to Reaſon, but confirm'd by many and ſuccesful Trials, both in the Caſe of <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Moon-Eyes.</hi> If both the Eyes be affected, you muſt perform the Operation on each Side.</p>
                     <p>The moſt frequent Cauſes of the Loſs of a Horſe's Eye are, in my Opinion, the too great <hi>Abundance</hi> of <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> and the <hi>Defect</hi> of <hi>Viſual Spirits,</hi> both which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by the two above-mention'd Operations. For the <hi>cutting of the Nerve</hi> promotes the Courſe of the Spirits, and the <hi>taking up the Vein</hi> keeps back the ſuperfluous Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will be yet more effectually perform'd, and the Cure haſten'd by <hi>taking up</hi> the two <hi>Jugulars,</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Neck-Veins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is troubl'd with Rheums, you muſt give him ſomething to cool his Blood. Thus an Ounce of <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> in Powder, mix'd every day with his Bran, will allay the Heat, and leſſen the Defluxion: but if you perceive that this weakens his Stomach too much, and makes him forſake his Meat, you may ſubſtitute <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> inſtead of it, till he recover his Appetite, and then give him <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> again till the Cure be compleated.</p>
                     <p>To what has been ſaid I ſhall add a very rare but true Obſervation. I ſaw a Horſe who had ſo good Eyes, that 'twas impoſſible to find any Defect in 'em; being one Day under his Maſter in the Field, a great <hi>Thunder-clap</hi> depriv'd him of both his Eyes in an inſtant, and he remain'd blind ever after.</p>

                        <p>If the Eye be ſwoll'n, hot, clos'd up, and red or blood-ſhotten, you muſt immediately prepare a reſtringent Charge to ſtop the flowing of the Humours. Take common <hi>Bole-Armenic</hi> in Powder, mix it with <hi>Vinegar</hi> and the <hi>Whites</hi> of two <hi>Eggs,</hi> till it be reduc'd to a kind of Paſte, which you muſt apply Morning and Evening about the Eye for half a foot round, and bathe the Eye with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> or uſe that which follows. Take a new-laid Egg boil'd hard, and having taken off the Shell, cut it thro' the middle, and take out the Yolk, in the place of which put a piece of <hi>white Vitriol</hi> about the bigneſs of a Nut, then join the two halves of the Egg, and wrapping it in a piece of clean and fine Linnen, infuſe it in half a Glaſs of <hi>Roſe-Water</hi> for the ſpace of ſix hours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which throw away the ſoak'd Egg as uſeleſs, and reſerving the Water, pour eight or ten Drops of it into the Horſe's Eye with a Feather, Morning and Evening, which will quickly perfect the Cure. If you make uſe of <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> you muſt bathe the Eye with a little fine Sponge ſoak'd in it, five or ſix times a day; and Experience will convince you that you cannot chuſe a better Remedy either for <hi>Rheums</hi> or <hi>Blows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Diſtemper require a preſent Remedy, you may inſtantly prepare that which follows.</p>
                        <p>Take the <hi>White</hi> of a new-laid <hi>Egg,</hi> an equal Quantity of <hi>Roſe-Water, white Vitriol</hi> in fine Powder the bigneſs of a ſmall Nut; beat 'em well with a ſtick: Some of this being put into the Eye will divert the <hi>Rheum,</hi> and take away the Heat.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Waters will not keep good above ſeven or eight days at moſt, after which they turn ſharp.

                        <p>You ought to make choice of a good Medicine at firſt, and not change it lightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; for nothing retards the Cure more than the Change of Remedies: Every one thinks his own beſt; but when you have begun with one, and find Benefit by it, you ought to ſtick to it afterwards.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIX. <hi>Of</hi> Blows <hi>on the</hi> Eyes.</head>
                     <p>IF the Soreneſs of the Eye be occaſion'd by a <hi>Blow, Bruiſe,</hi> or <hi>Biting,</hi> you muſt view the Part carefully, not only before you apply any Remedies, but during the whole Progreſs of the Diſtemper, that you be able to judge of the Greatneſs of the Hurt, and of the Probability of the Cure; and upon occaſion change your Remedies, applying either ſtrong or weak Medicines, according to the Urgency of the Symptoms. If the Eye be very big and ſwoll'n, and ſend forth Matter, you may conclude that the Cure will be long, becauſe the <hi>Stroak</hi> or <hi>Biting</hi> has certainly ſpoil'd and corrupted ſome Part within the Eye, which is turn'd to Matter; and if that continue to run too long, as for Example, twelve or fifteen Days, the Horſe is in great danger of loſing his Eye; unleſs when he voids the <hi>Strangles</hi> by his Eyes, which may be done without the leaſt Prejudice to thoſe Parts.</p>
                     <p>If when the Horſe begins to open his Eye, you perceive the <hi>Chryſtallin</hi> Humour which was darken'd by the Blow, to be cover'd with a ſort of greeniſh Cloud, 'tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sign. If red Spots like Clots of Blood, appear and remain on the ſame Part, tis properly an ill Sign, denoting the Violence of the Blow, and the Greatneſs of the Contuſion, and preſaging the long Continuance of the Diſeaſe, but it ſhews alſo the Strength of Nature, in expelling that which offends the Eye.</p>
                     <p>If the ſame Part be hurt, as 'tis almoſt alway by a violent Blow, the Horſe will be in great danger of having his Eye mark'd with a white <hi>Spot</hi> or <hi>Pearl,</hi> which ſometimes is of the Bigneſs of a <hi>Lentil,</hi> and ſometimes equals a <hi>Pea,</hi> being a ſort of <hi>Callus</hi> produc'd by Nature to fill up the Hole made by the Stroak.</p>
                     <p>If during the Progreſs of a long and tedious Diſeaſe, the Subſtance or Ball of the Eye grow leſs, that part is irrecoverably loſt: but you muſt beware of Miſtakes, for you may fancy the Eye to be leſs than it was, when in the Declination of the Diſeaſe the Swelling diſappears, and the ſame Part which you were accuſtom'd to ſee very big and ſwoll'n, ſeems then to be diminiſh'd; and oftentimes the Eye-lids are drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179659:252"/>by the conſtant uſe of aſtringent Remedies, and make the Eyes ſeem ſmaller, tho' they be not really diminiſh'd.</p>
                     <p>When the Swelling diſappears in the upper part of the Eye, tho' the Parts below the Eye remain ſtill ſwoln, 'tis a ſign that the Diſeaſe abates, and that the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the Eye will not continue long.</p>
                     <p>If the Blow be ſmall you muſt immediately cut the tip of the Ear on the ſame ſide, making a Wound equal to the thickneſs of a Half-Crown Piece, and ſqueeze as much Blood out of it as you can. This is an eaſie and preſent Remedy, for the Horſe will inſtantly open his Eye.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire to ſee the Inſide of the Eye, whether the Soreneſs be occaſion'd by a Blow or Rheum, tho' it be ſhut; cover the other Eye with your Hand, and make the Horſe walk, for he will certainly open the ſore Eye as wide as he can, by which means you may, in ſome meaſure, diſcover the nature of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>If the Blow be great, you muſt immediately open the Vein of the Eye or Neck, and take out a large quantity of Blood (whereas you muſt never let a Horſe Blood that is troubl'd only with Rheum) for the Bleeding will prevent all Accidents. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you muſt take care that he be fed with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and a little <hi>Hay,</hi> without any <hi>Oats,</hi> that he be not Wrought, nor expos'd to the Cold, and that the Stable be not too warm. The <hi>Summer-Dew</hi> and <hi>Night-Air</hi> are good for Diſeaſes of the Eyes, by allaying the Heat. Afterwards apply a <hi>Reſtringent</hi> Medicine about his Eye, or the <hi>Ointment</hi> deſcrib'd in the preceding Chapter, with <hi>Album Rhaſis, Salt of Lead,</hi> &amp;c. or put into his Eye the Solution of <hi>Lapis Mirabilis</hi> in Water, which is the only Sovereign Remedy, and may ſerve inſtead of all others. <hi>Note,</hi> That you muſt not be weary'd by the long continuance of thoſe Diſeaſes; for tho' the Cure is oftentimes very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it will be perfected at laſt, if you perſevere in the application of convenient Remedies.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot procure <hi>Lapis Mirabilis,</hi> take half a Pint of <hi>Plantane, Fennel,</hi> or <hi>Roſe-Water,</hi> or a third part of each; or if none of theſe can be had, the ſame quantity of <hi>Common Water, White Copperas</hi> an Ounce and a half, Powder of the Roots of <hi>Flower-de-Luce</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> two Drams, ſuffer 'em to ſtand about an hour in a Glaſs Bottle, in a cold Infuſion, then waſh your Horſe's Eye with it two or three times a day. This is a very good Remedy.</p>
                     <p>If after one or two Applications, you perceive that it makes the Eye ſmart too much, 'tis a ſign that the Infuſion is too ſtrong, and therefore you may temper it with half a Glaſs of Water. This is a very excellent and cheap Remedy, and good both for <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Blows:</hi> I have often us'd it with Succeſs, when <hi>Lapis Mirabilis</hi> cou'd not be had.</p>
                     <p>All the Remedies preſcrib'd for <hi>Rheums,</hi> are alſo good for <hi>Blows;</hi> the only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in <hi>Bleeding,</hi> which is proper in the <hi>latter,</hi> but hurtful in the <hi>former</hi> Caſes.</p>
                     <p>After you have us'd <hi>Reſtringent</hi> Applications or <hi>Charges</hi> for ſome days, the Diſeaſe being now at its greateſt heighth, take <hi>Ground-Ivy,</hi> and Leaves of <hi>Celandine,</hi> beat 'em, and preſs out the <hi>Juice,</hi> which being ſettl'd and ſtrain'd thro' brown Paper, you may put into the Horſe's Eye, Morning and Evening. This Remedy cleanſes, drys, and clears the Eye, which otherwiſe might remain charg'd with a <hi>Webb</hi> or <hi>Film.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXX. <hi>Of</hi> Lapis Mirabilis, <hi>or the</hi> Wonderful Stone.</head>
                     <p>THE Effects of this Stone are exactly ſuitable to its Name; 'tis compos'd thus, Take <hi>White Vitriol</hi> two Pounds, <hi>Roch Allum</hi> three Pounds, fine <hi>Bole-Armenic</hi> half a Pound, <hi>Litharge</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> two Ounces. Reduce all the Ingredients to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and put 'em into a new glaz'd Earthen Pot, with three Quarts of Water. Boil 'em very gently over a ſmall Fire, without Smoke, ſet equally round the Pot, till the Water be wholly evaporated, and the Matter at the bottom perfectly dry; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Pot from the Fire, and ſuffer the Matter to cool, which ought to be hard, and will ſtill grow harder, the longer 'tis kept.</p>
                     <p>Put half an Ounce of this <hi>Stone</hi> in a Glaſs-Bottle, with four Ounces of Water; it will be diſſolv'd in a quarter of an hour, and make the Water <hi>white</hi> as Milk when
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179659:253"/>you ſhake the Bottle: You muſt waſh the ſore Eye Morning and Evening, with the Water, or Solution.</p>
                     <p>This Liquor, thus prepar'd, may be kept twenty days.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Apothecaries</hi> keep this Stone in their Shops, and make uſe of it for Men: And as for me, I uſe it for Horſes, nor ever ſeek any other Remedy for <hi>Rheums, Blows,</hi> or <hi>Moon-Eyes.</hi> Every Man that is Maſter of a Horſe ought to keep ſome of it by him; for it will keep good very long, and there are few Remedies for the Eyes that are not inferiour to it.</p>
                     <p>When this <hi>Stone</hi> is reduc'd to Powder, and blown into the Eye, it cauſes too much Pain, tho' afterwards it produces good Effects; and therefore I dare not adviſe you to make uſe of it till it be diſſolv'd in Water, leſt otherwiſe it ſhould occaſion ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Diſorder.</p>
                     <p>If you diſſolve two Drams of it in three Ounces of Water, it will dry a Wound or Sore, and allay the Heat, if you waſh 'em twice a day with the Solution, and apply a Linnen Clout dipt in the ſame to the griev'd part.</p>
                     <p>Take the quantity of a Walnut of this <hi>Stone,</hi> and infuſe it in a Bottle capable of containing an ordinary Glaſs, or half a Pint of Water: This Solution, apply'd as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is excellent for <hi>Rheums</hi> and <hi>Moon-Eyes;</hi> and you may fill up the Bottle with freſh Water, according as you have occaſion to empty it, that it may be ſtill kept full till the end of the Cure, for 'tis not neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo ſtrong at laſt as it was at firſt. You muſt always remember to ſhake the Bottle before you pour any Water into the Eye.</p>
                     <p>If by reaſon of the violence of the <hi>Blow,</hi> the Eye remain cover'd with a <hi>white Film,</hi> after you have taken away the Heat, and ſtopt the flowing of the Humour with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies; you muſt in the next place endeavour to remove the <hi>white Film,</hi> by the following Method. After you have waſh'd the Eye with Wine, make one of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants immediately open the Eye-lids, and taking up ſome <hi>Wheat-Flower</hi> with your Thumb, ſtroke the Eye gently with it. This way of putting Powders into the Eye with your Thumb, is a great deal better than the uſual Method of Farriers, who blow Powders into the Eye with a Leaden-Pipe; for after you have blown 'em in two or three times, the Horſe is ſo afraid that he will do any thing rather than ſuffer you to ſerve him ſo again; whereas if you put 'em in with your Thumb, tho' they make his Eye ſmart extreamly, he cannot ſo ſoon perceive whence the Pain comes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Wheat-Flower</hi> frequently apply'd will conſume the <hi>Film:</hi> But if you perceive that it has not the deſir'd effect, you muſt uſe <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> in fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is an excellent Remedy, and conſumes the <hi>Film,</hi> and even a <hi>Webb,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heating the Eye, which is the common inconveniency of other Powders.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXI. <hi>Of</hi> Lunatic, <hi>or</hi> Moon Eyes.</head>
                     <p>THE Eyes of thoſe Horſes that are troubl'd with this Diſtemper are darken'd by a <hi>Rheum,</hi> at certain times of the <hi>Moon,</hi> whereas at other times they appear ſo bright, that you would conclude they were perfectly ſound. The Defluxion is uſually moſt violent in the <hi>Wane</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſometimes about the <hi>Full-Moon,</hi> and it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ends in <hi>Blindneſs.</hi> Some enjoy an Interval of ſix Months, others are troubl'd with a return of the Diſtemper once in three Months, and ſome grow <hi>Lunatic</hi> every two Months.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Imperfection are particularly deſcrib'd in the Second Part.</p>
                     <p>During the time that the Eye is actually ſeiz'd with the Rheum, it appears hot, ſwoln, dark, cover'd, and weeping, which are the proper ſigns of a Defluxion: But the ſureſt ſign of this Diſtemper is, when under the Apple 'tis of a faint yellow Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, during the time of the Defluxion; for afterwards that Colour vaniſhes with the Rheum.</p>
                     <p>You muſt never <hi>Bleed</hi> a <hi>Lunatic</hi> Horſe on any occaſion whatſoever, unleſs you are compell'd to have recourſe to that Operation by ſome unavoidable neceſſity, as by <hi>Fevers</hi> or <hi>Gripings;</hi> in which caſes you may let him Blood in the Flank.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen <hi>Lunatic</hi> Horſes, who having been let Blood for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> grew Blind ſhortly after.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not give the Horſe any ſort of <hi>Grain,</hi> while his Eye is actually troubl'd with the Rheum, but feed him with <hi>Hay, Straw,</hi> and moiſten'd <hi>Bran.</hi> You may alſo make a <hi>Seton</hi> on his Pole between his Ears, by thruſting a ſharp Iron, red hot, quite thro' the part where his Mane begins, and on which the Head-ſtall of the Bridle reſts, and putting into the Hole a plaited Cord, one half Hair, and the other Hemp, anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> which muſt be turn'd round, and drawn backward and forward every Morning, to let forth the Matter that has been gathering for the ſpace of four and twenty Hours. Others keep the <hi>Seton</hi> open with a <hi>Lead-Ring</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Cord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seton</hi> will divert the Humour from the Eyes, and eaſe the Horſe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by evacuating part of it.</p>
                     <p>Some make two <hi>Setons,</hi> one on the fore-part of the Head, where the Tuft of the <hi>Mane</hi> lies over the Fore-head, and another behind where the end of the Head-ſtall reſts; but without any conſiderable benefit.</p>
                     <p>If the Weather be fair let the Horſe lie abroad to receive the Night-Dew; but if it be Cold, keep him in a Stable that is not very hot: For the Heat of the Stable is very hurtful to <hi>Lunatic</hi> Eyes.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very convenient for a <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> Horſe, to <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Vein,</hi> when the <hi>Rheum</hi> is at the heighth, and when you can meet with an expert Farrier: And it will not be improper to cut the <hi>Nerve</hi> that lies under the Vein, as I taught you before. But tho' you do not think fit to cut the <hi>Nerve,</hi> you muſt of neceſſity <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Vein,</hi> which may be eaſily done with a crooked Needle, as in the caſe of Defluxions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>taking up</hi> of the <hi>Jugular Veins</hi> will very much promote the Cure; and you may alſo obſerve the following Directions.</p>
                     <p>'Tis extreamly profitable for <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> Horſes to <hi>rowel</hi> 'em at the ſide of each Eye, on the flat part of the Cheek-Bone, to divert the Humour from flowing to the Eyes, and more eſpecially to evacuate that which is already fall'n upon 'em.</p>
                     <p>The Operation is thus perform'd. Cut the Skin overthwart with a Launce or Razor, and ſeparate it from the Fleſh, about three Inches upwards with the handle of a Slice; then put into the Hole a piece of Lead, two Inches long, and one broad, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up the Skin a little below the Inciſion made with the Launce, to keep the Lead ſure. Let the <hi>Rowels</hi> remain twelve or fifteen days, and make the Matter run out twice every day, by preſſing the part gently downwards. The Orifices made either by a <hi>Seton</hi> or <hi>Rowel</hi> heal of themſelves after the Cord or Lead is taken out: Inſtead of Lead you may put into the Hole a little Straw, or a piece of an old Shoe, or <hi>Gentian</hi>-Root. After theſe precautions you may proceed to the uſe of <hi>Rue-Water.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXII. <hi>Of the beſt way of making</hi> Rue-Water, <hi>to Cure</hi> Moon-Eyes.</head>
                     <p>SInce <hi>Rue-Water</hi> is an excellent and ſpecific Medicine for the Eyes of Horſes, and is not to be had every where, I thought fit to ſubjoin the true way of preparing it. Take three or four handfuls of <hi>Rue,</hi> cut it ſmall, and put it into a Diſh of Silver, or Earth glaz'd, which you muſt ſet on a Chafing-Diſh, with another Diſh on the top of it, and give it a gentle Heat. Remove the upper Diſh from time to time, and take out the Water which you will find ſticking about it, with a Feather, then ſet it on as before, and let it ſtand for ſome time; after which take it off again, and you will find more Water. When you have gather'd a conſiderable quantity of Water, as for example, a ſmall Glaſs-full, diſſolve in it the bigneſs of an ordinary Walnut of <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> and bathe the Eye with it Morning and Evening; or if this be not of ſufficient efficacy, make uſe of the <hi>Lapis Mirabilis.</hi> And if that Stone ſhould fail too, as it may ſometimes happen to do when the Eye is very much inflam'd, you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Oil of Lead,</hi> pouring ſeven or eight drops of it into the Eye every day, which is an incomparable Remedy, and will fully anſwer your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oil of Lead</hi> is a ſpecific Remedy for Defluxions on the Eyes, and eſpecially for thoſe that follow the Motions of the <hi>Moon.</hi> If you adminiſter it a little before the uſual time at which the <hi>Moon</hi> brings down the <hi>Rheum,</hi> that Symptom will be prevented, and the Eye remain ſound: And by perſiſting in the uſe of this Medicine, that is, by putting two drops of it into the Eye every day with a Feather, you may preſerve Horſes that are ſubject to <hi>Moon-Eyes</hi> for ſeveral Years, without the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their wonted Diſtemper, their Eyes remaining all the while ſound and bright.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be actually ſeiz'd with the Diſtemper, you muſt adminiſter the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy twice a day, and you will be quickly convinc'd of its Efficacy.</p>
                     <p>I have often try'd it with a great deal of ſatisfaction, and you may ſafely depend upon it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXIII. <hi>Of</hi> Oil of Lead, <hi>call'd,</hi> Oleum Saturni.</head>
                     <p>THere are different Methods of preparing this Medicine preſcrib'd by all the moſt celebrated <hi>Chymiſts</hi> both Ancient and Modern, who give it the name of <hi>Oil,</hi> tho' improperly, becauſe 'tis not Inflamable; and I thought fit to retain the ſame Name, ſince the uſe of it is confirm'd by ſuch Illuſtrious Writers as <hi>Paracelſus, Crollius, Zwelfer,</hi> &amp;c. Among all the various Preparations of it, I choſe to make uſe of that which follows, as the leaſt intricate: But if you are not expert enough in theſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, you may employ ſome Artiſt to prepare it Methodically, tho' you will find the following Deſcription of it ſo clear and exact, that it may be eaſily made by any Man that has the leaſt skill in <hi>Diſtillation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take ſix Pounds of <hi>Ceruſe,</hi> reduc'd to Powder, by rubbing it on the bottom of a Searce turn'd upwards, put it into an Earthen Pot with ten Quarts of <hi>diſtill'd Vinegar,</hi> and digeſt 'em in a Sand-Furnace, three Days and three Nights, ſtirring the bottom of the Matter from time to time with a Wooden Slice; then filtrate the <hi>diſtill'd Vinegar,</hi> impregnated with the <hi>Salt of Lead,</hi> and evaporate all the moiſture, which will leave the true and <hi>fixt Salt</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> which you muſt put into a Glaſs <hi>Retort,</hi> leaving two thirds of it empty. Place the <hi>Retort</hi> with its <hi>Recipient</hi> in a <hi>Sand-Furnace,</hi> giving at firſt a very gentle Fire, which muſt be gradually augmented till nothing come out of the <hi>Retort.</hi> Then let the Veſſels cool, and you will find in the <hi>Recipient</hi> the <hi>Oil of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179659:254"/>Lead,</hi> which you may make ſtronger by evaporating the third part of the <hi>Phlegm</hi> which it contains; but without any evaporation, it will be ſtrong enough for the <hi>Lunatic</hi> Eyes of a Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The remaining Matter is an excellent <hi>Salt of Lead,</hi> of good uſe in ſeveral caſes: It may be apply'd either alone, or mixt with ſeveral <hi>Ointments</hi> to divert Rheums, or allay exceſſive Heat, as I ſhall afterwards obſerve: But 'tis ſtronger than that which is uſually Sold by <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> who cryſtallize it to make it more pleaſant to the Eye; neither do I think it proper to be us'd inwardly till it be diſſolv'd in Water, filtrated, evaporated, cryſtalliz'd in a Cellar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know by experience, that ſome pretended <hi>Chymiſts</hi> will tell you that this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is impoſſible; but I always found that they were either Ignorant or wanted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Veſſels. I have prepar'd it, and caus'd it to be prepar'd, neither will any Man who has the leaſt skill in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> complain of the difficulty of the Work.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> is call'd <hi>Sugar of Lead,</hi> becauſe of its ſweetneſs to the Taſte, and being free of that Acrimony or ſharpneſs which is common to all other <hi>Salts,</hi> 'tis uſeful not only for <hi>Moon-Eyes,</hi> but for all manner of <hi>Rheums</hi> in the Eyes, without occaſioning the leaſt Pain or Smarting; for it allays the immoderate, and confirms the natural Heat of thoſe Organs, and conſequently diverts the Rheum. You may diſſolve two Drams of it in Water of <hi>Nightſhade, Celandine,</hi> or <hi>Eye-bright,</hi> and bathe the Eyes with the Solution.</p>
                     <p>A certain Modern Author writes, That if it be expos'd to the Air it diſſolves into a Liquor; but I am not altogether of his Opinion; for tho' the Air has ſome influence upon it, yet it cannot reduce it to a Liquor. The <hi>Salt</hi> is more eaſily to be had than the <hi>Oil,</hi> but 'tis not ſo effectual.</p>
                     <p>They who are profeſt Enemies to the Art of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and endeavour to diſcredit all its Operations, pretend that we ought by no means to uſe the <hi>Salt of Lead,</hi> ſince 'tis only <hi>Lead</hi> Calcin'd, as indeed if it be melted in a <hi>Crucible</hi> with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> it will return to its firſt Subſtance: But tho' <hi>Mercury,</hi> however diſguis'd, may be rednc'd to true and fluid <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> yet 'tis apply'd to ſeveral Uſes, becauſe the Body of it is artificially open'd, and either made familiar to our Bodies, or render'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to empty the part to which it is apply'd, whereas in its own Nature 'tis cloſe, and unfit to produce thoſe Effects which are daily caus'd by ſome Preparations of it. So the ſubſtance of the <hi>Lead</hi> being open'd, and united to the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which diſſolves it, it has a wonderful Vertue to cool the Eye; but by melting it with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Vinegar</hi> is deſtroy'd by that <hi>Salt,</hi> and the parts of the <hi>Lead</hi> having nothing to keep 'em in their new ſituation, are again reduc'd to <hi>Lead,</hi> tho' but in a ſmall quantity.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXIV. <hi>Of cleanſing the Horſe's Eye</hi> below, <hi>or cutting out the</hi> Haw.</head>
                     <p>WHen there is no preſent ſign or appearance of a Defluxion in the Eye, and the part is as clear as its Infirmity will allow, you may have recourſe to a Manual Operation, which has been ſucceſsfully adminiſter'd to ſome <hi>Moon-ey'd</hi> Horſes, and without any effect to others; and therefore you muſt not imagine that this Operation can reſtore an Eye which is ſo weaken'd by the Rheum that 'tis almoſt quite loſt. But all that can be reaſonably expected from this Method is, that it will preſerve the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179659:255"/>Eyes in the ſame condition, as when the Operation was perform'd, and prevent the total loſs of 'em.</p>
                     <p>This Operation ought to be adminiſter'd (if poſſible) in the <hi>Wane</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and after this manner. In the firſt place having caſt the Horſe, apply a ſmall piece of Money, mark'd, to the corner of the Eye, between the Eye and the <hi>Haw,</hi> which is a <hi>Cartilage</hi> that all Horſes have, by the help of which you may thruſt a threaded Needle into the <hi>Haw,</hi> without hurting the Eye: Then pull back the lower Eye-lid with your Finger, and draw forth the Thread faſten'd to the <hi>Haw,</hi> which will follow and draw after it a piece of <hi>glandulous Fleſh.</hi> Pull it forth ſoftly, cutting by degrees with a Launce that which holds it on each ſide, and as you draw out the <hi>Haw</hi> the piece of Fleſh that ſticks to it will follow. Proceed in this manner pulling and cutting, but very gently, till you have taken out a piece of <hi>glandulous Fleſh,</hi> of the bigneſs of an Inch, and half a Finger in length; and from time to time, during the Operation, waſh away the Blood with Water, that you may ſee what you are doing. Having cut the <hi>Haw</hi> out of each Eye, <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Vein,</hi> and afterwards every Morning and Evening waſh the Eye with <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> or with the Solution of <hi>Lapis Mirabilis</hi> in Water. In the mean time you muſt not ſuffer the Horſe to eat <hi>Oats,</hi> but feed him only with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> for fifteen or twenty days; after which you may ſafely make him return to his Labour, and give him <hi>Oats</hi> to eat.</p>
                     <p>This Operation is grounded on a very natural way of Reaſoning: For as ſeveral parts of the Body are furniſh'd with <hi>Emunctories</hi> or Receptacles of bad Humours, ſo there is a lump of glandulous or ſpongy Fleſh under the Eye, which is as it were the ſink of the Brain, and receives the ſharp, raw, and undigeſted Humours, which that part throws off. Theſe Humours exhale and ſend up hot and burning Vapours to the Eye, which prick and irritate it, and afterwards draw thither all the Impurities of the Neighbouring Parts. Thus we ſee that the Eye is always more ſubject to Heat and Vapours below than above, as you may particularly obſerve in <hi>Moon-Eyes,</hi> which, during the time of the Rheum, appear of a faint yellow Colour below, and almoſt never above. This being ſuppos'd, as 'tis certainly true, 'tis plain that by cutting out this kernelly Fleſh, you take away the Receptacle of the Humours, which therefore muſt take another courſe, and fall upon the Neighbouring Parts, ſuch as the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fleſh, leſs tender and delicate than the Eye, where Nature will be ſufficiently able to digeſt and concoct 'em. And from what has been ſaid, you may reaſonably conclude, that this Operation can only preſerve the Eye in its preſent Condition, but not reſtore it to its former Perfection. Beſides, when you <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Vein,</hi> you may cut the <hi>Nerve</hi> that lies under it, for the Reaſons alledg'd before.</p>

                        <p>To perform this Operation, you muſt cut the Skin in the middle of the hollow part above the Eye with a Launce, and with a Hook pull out the Fat which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in that part, and may be eaſily ſeparated from it: After you have taken out the quantity of a Walnut, waſh the Wound with warm Wine, and fill the empty ſpace with fine Flax, ſmear'd with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> tying it on with two threads faſten'd to the Lips of the Wound. Dreſs the Sore every day with warm <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum,</hi> till it be heal'd; and in the mean time great care muſt be taken to preſerve it from the leaſt blaſt of Wind, which might produce dangerous Conſequences. But, after all, I never found this Operation beneficial to the Eyes; and therefore I ſlight it as much as I eſteem the other.</p>
                        <p>Since all Men are not fond of <hi>Knives</hi> and <hi>Launces,</hi> I ſhall proceed to deſcribe other Remedies for <hi>Moon-Eyes,</hi> among which <hi>Purgation</hi> is uſually reckon'd, which muſt not be adminiſter'd till the Eye be wholly freed from the Rheum, for otherwiſe it will do more harm than good.</p>

                     <p>ON or about the Twentieth Day of the Moon, draw a Line with a Red-hot Knife, from one Ear to the other, under the Head-ſtall of the Bridle, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Mark left by the burning, and draw the Knife backwards and forwards till the Line it makes be of a Cherry-colour, then burn a <hi>Star</hi> over the Eye-Veins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piercing the Fleſh, for the Scar would never wear out. After the Scab is fall'n off, bathe the Sore with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> Morning and Evening, and tho' you neither apply <hi>Pitch</hi> nor <hi>Butter,</hi> there will ſeldom remain any Scar: But if you pierce the Skin, you muſt bathe the part every Morning and Evening with <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> mixt with <hi>Honey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſeen <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> Horſes cur'd by this way of burning: And the worſt that can happen is that you may preſerve one Eye by putting out the other. For if both the Eyes be ſubject to this Infirmity, the viſual Spirits of that which is loſt, retire to the other and ſtrengthen it: And beſides, you may preſerve the Eyes for ſome time, by <hi>taking up</hi> the two Veins in the Neck, call'd the <hi>Jugulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All <hi>Lunatic</hi> and <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> Horſes at laſt grow Blind, unleſs that Diſaſter be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Methods above preſcrib'd, or by putting out one Eye, which muſt be thus perform'd. Thruſt a threaded Needle into the worſt Eye, making the Point come out in the part oppoſite to that where it enter'd, and leave the Thread hanging at it ſeven or eight days, during which time the Eye will continually caſt forth Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till it grow dry: Then take out the Thread, and by degrees the viſual Spirits which paſs to the other Eye, will ſtrengthen and preſerve it from the like Infirmity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:179659:256"/>and the pierc'd Eye will be dry'd up. I have ſeen a Horſe who had an Eye of Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel or Glaſs put in the place of one of his Eyes which had been put out ot preſerve the other. This is a hereditary Diſtemper, and therefore great care muſt be taken to chuſe <hi>Stallions</hi> that have good Eyes: It may be alſo occaſion'd by the <hi>Foal</hi>'s eating Oats with his <hi>Dam,</hi> when he is but one Year Old, or younger; for by their ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endeavouring to chew the Oats, the Veins above and about their Eyes are ſtretch'd and diſtended, and conſequently draw too much Blood to thoſe Parts, which, by the too great quantity of Nouriſhment, are heated and render'd obnoxious to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions; either to that kind which follows the courſe of the Moon, or to the other which waſts and deſtroys the Eye. I have borrow'd this Obſervation from a Treatiſe concerning Horſes, compos'd by one <hi>John Taquet,</hi> who expreſly affirms, that the loſs of the Foals Eyes is not occaſion'd by the ſubſtance of the Oats, which may be ſuppos'd to heat 'em, but only by their ſtraining too hard in chewing that hard ſort of Food: And to prevent theſe fatal Conſequences he adviſes thoſe who have Foals to cauſe their Oats to be ground or ſtamp'd; by which means, he ſays, they will grow ſtrong and luſty, without the leaſt danger of Rheums, or any other Infirmity of the Eyes. Since I never found this Remark in any other Author, I thought fit to inſert it here; ſubmitting it intirely to the Reader's Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes become <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> at the Age of <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> Years, who were always very ſound before, which is an Infirmity entail'd on 'em by their <hi>Sire.</hi> And beſides, when young Horſes are overtaken by a great Storm in the Fields, they are oftentimes either render'd <hi>Lunatic,</hi> or ſtruck Blind with the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Hard work haſtens the total Blindneſs of a <hi>Moon-Ey'd</hi> Horſe; and beſides, Heat and extream Cold are equally prejudicial to him. To conclude, This Infirmity uſually ends in the loſs of one or both Eyes; for the beſt Remedies are not always ſucceſsful; and we may juſtly call that a good Medicine which is found to be effectual on ſeveral Occaſions, tho' it be not always Infallible.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>HAEmorrhagy</hi> is a voiding of Blood by the Noſe or Mouth, occaſion'd by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of the Blood mixt with a Liquor full of Spirits and Salt, which makes the Blood boil and ferment, till the Veſſels not being able to contain it, ſome of the Veins burſt, and diſgorge the Blood thro' the Noſe; and the mixture of that Salt Juice with the Blood, is caus'd by unuſual Fatigues in hot Weather. The redundancy of the Blood may alſo proceed from too much Feeding; or it may be deprav'd and vitiated; or its Boiling may be occaſion'd by violent Exerciſe, which opens the Mouths of ſome Veins, from which it guſhes out impetuouſly, either by the Noſe or Mouth. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that a Liquor full of Spirits and Salt is apt to make the Blood boil and ferment, it will be ſufficient to inform you, that if you mix either the <hi>Spirit of Wine, Vitriol, Hartſhorn,</hi> or <hi>Soot</hi> with the Blood that is taken out of the Vein, while 'tis hot, you will immediately perceive a violent Ebullition; whereas <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> and the Solution of <hi>Allum</hi> trouble and precipitate the <hi>Blood;</hi> and none but ſuch as are wholly Ignorant of the Internal Motions and Methods of Nature, will deny that there are ſuch Liquors full of Salt and Spirits in the Bodies of Horſes.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Bleeding</hi> be not ſtop'd, it may either kill the Horſe or extreamly weaken him; becauſe Nature is quite ſpent and exhauſted by ſuch an exceſſive Expence of Blood and Spirits. When ſuch Accidents happen, the Horſes remain unfit for Service a great while after, but they ſeldom die unleſs they be alſo ſeiz'd with a Fever, which does not uſually happen.</p>
                     <p>Since theſe Accidents ſeldom or never happen but in very hot Weather, every Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Horſe is fat, or rather fiery and full of Mettle, who' out of Wind, ſhould keep him in and reſtrain him at the firſt, and endeavour by all prudent Methods to prevent the Diſorders that are occaſion'd by Bleeding, or perhaps ſome other more dangerous Diſtemper. And 'tis certain that in ſuch caſes the moſt preſent Remedy is always the beſt.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:179659:256"/>
                     <p>Aſſoon as you perceive the Blood to iſſue out of the Horſe's Noſe or Mouth, or both, you muſt immediately let him Blood in the Flanks, or the Plate-Veins of the Thighs, or rather in the Neck, if you cannot take Blood enough out of the other Parts: then take a large quantity of <hi>Knot-graſs,</hi> (call'd in Latin <hi>Centinodia,</hi> becauſe at its perfect Growth it has a <hi>hundred Knots</hi> on one Stalk) which is a Specific Remedy to ſtanch Blood; beat it to a Maſh, and fill the Horſe's Noſtrils with it, binding alſo ſome of it to his Temples and Reins, where the Saddle ends, and even to his Stones, if he be not gelt.</p>
                     <p>This is a very common Herb; but if you cannot find it, take <hi>Nettles</hi> and apply 'em after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo put the Horſe into Water up to his Flanks, and let him ſtand in it two Hours, if it be Summer, which is the uſual time in which theſe Accidents happen.</p>
                     <p>If you are not in a convenient place to plunge him into Water, cover his Head and Back with a Cloth ſeven or eight times doubld, and dipp'd in <hi>Oxycrate</hi> (or <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Water):</hi> keep him in the Stable with his Head upright, not ſuffering him to lie down, and from time to time throw cold Water on his Cods or Sheath: the next Day bleed him again, and give him cooling <hi>Clyſters.</hi> Some Horſes have been troubld with void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood ſix or ſeven Days together, but it did not run ſo violently at laſt, as at the Beginning, and they were cur'd by the above-mentiond Remedies.</p>

                        <p>If the Blood continue ſtill to flow, take <hi>Plantane Leaves</hi> beaten and mix'd with <hi>Male Frankincenſe, Aloes</hi> or <hi>Myrrh,</hi> and put 'em into his Noſtrils, holding his Noſe up as if you were going to give him a <hi>Drench.</hi> Then cover his Head, Back, and Reins with a Cloth five or ſix times doubl'd and dipp'd in <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> as you were taught before, and throw cold Water frequently on his Sheath and Stones, if he has any.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the Blood flows ſo violently out of the Noſtrils, that it cannot be ſo ſoon ſtopp'd; in which Caſe you may uſe the following Powder, which is eaſily prepar'd.

                     <p>I Know not whether <hi>Stags</hi> are alſo troubl'd with this Diſeaſe, as the Name ſeems to import, but it proves oftentimes fatal to Horſes. 'Tis a kind of <hi>Rheumatiſm,</hi> which keeps their Neck and Jaws ſo ſtiff that they cannot move 'em, not ſo much as to eat; and beſides they turn up the Whites of their Eyes from time to time, as if they were juſt ready to expire. They are alſo ſeiz'd at uncertain Intervals of time, with ſuch a violent <hi>Palpitation</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Heaving</hi> or <hi>Beating</hi> in the <hi>Flanks,</hi> that you wou'd certainly conclude they cou'd not live two Hours; and theſe Fits return ſooner or later without any fix'd Order. If you feel their Neck, you will perceive it to be ſtiff and ſtretch'd out, the Skin is dry, and ſometimes the whole Body is ſtiff, and the hinder Parts as much affected by the Diſtemper as the fore Parts; in which Caſe few or none eſcape, eſpecially if the Fever be continual, as almoſt always it is.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is not abſolutely Mortal when tis not an univerſal <hi>Rheumatiſm,</hi> ſpread over all the Body, or when the Horſes have brought it upon themſelves by violent ſtriving and drawing againſt the Halter, by which unruly Motions they ſtrain and ſtretch the Muſcles of the Neck, ſo as to draw the Humours to 'em. But that is not the uſual Cauſe of this Diſtemper; for 'tis almoſt always occaſion'd by the Horſe's being unſeaſonably expos'd to Heat or Cold, or by his being cool'd immediately after he has been over-heated; which ſudden Change ſtirs the redundant Humours, and breeds many Obſtructions, that hinder the Motion of the affected Parts, and cauſe a Pain not only in theſe, but alſo in the neighbouring Parts, or ſuch as have a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with 'em.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the <hi>Beating</hi> of the <hi>Flank</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> be very violent, yet when it intermits for a conſiderable ſpace of time, the Horſe recovers a ſufficient meaſure of Strength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Diſtemper: but (which is very dangerous) the Defluxion on the Jaws is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſtrong, that the poor ſtarv'd Creature dies merely for want of neceſſary Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and the natural Heat not finding any Aliments to employ its Force in their Digeſtion, grows ſometimes ſo violent, that it inflames the Blood, augments the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and at laſt kills the Horſe: to prevent which, you muſt give him <hi>ſoftening Clyſters,</hi> Morning and Evening, let him Blood frequently, and even once in two Days, till you ſee ſome Signs of Amendment; for upon this the Cure principally depends, tho' ſince it muſt be ſo often repeated, it will be ſufficient to take every time onely half the Quantity of Blood that is uſually taken from Horſes.</p>
                     <p>For his Food mix a little <hi>Bran</hi> with a great quantity of Water, that it may be as thin as Broth, and leave it before him the whole Day: for he will ſtir it with his Lips, and in his beſt Intervals endeavour to ſwallow a little of it; but he can very hardly, or not at all eat any <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>Straw,</hi> being unable to open his Jaws, and you may give him luke-warm Water to drink. After the Uſe of <hi>Clyſters</hi> and <hi>Bleeding,</hi> take equal parts of <hi>Spirit of Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> mix 'em in a glaſs Vial, and ſhake 'em to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till they be perfectly united: With this Liquor anoint his whole Neck, upon the Muſcles, and all about the Jaws, chafing the Parts very hard with your Hand, to make the Liquor penetrate, which will heat the Muſcles that are cool'd and ſtiffen'd by the Defluxion; and two hours after rub the ſame Parts with the <hi>Ointment of Marſh-Mallows,</hi> chaſing 'em hard as before, which will not only heat the Parts, but help to looſen the Jaws, and ſupple the Neck. Afterwards rub the Parts affected every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Ointment</hi> of <hi>Marſh-Mallows,</hi> and every Evening with <hi>Aqua-Vitae.</hi> And beſides,</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe affect the whole Body, rub the Horſe's Reins with <hi>Ointment of Marſh-Mallows</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and cover 'em with a Cloth dipp'd in <hi>Lees</hi> of Wine heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put his uſual Cloaths above all. Repeat the <hi>Anointing</hi> and <hi>Fomentation</hi> every day, and let him be put into a hot Stable; for being thus carefully tended, he may perhaps recover, if his <hi>Fever</hi> intermit.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo give him three or four good <hi>ſoftening Clyſters</hi> every day; and if the diſeaſe be very violent, you may inject one in the Morning, conſiſting of two Quarts of <hi>Milk,</hi> eight <hi>Yolks of Eggs,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sugar,</hi> to ſuſtain, and in ſome meaſure ſatiate the <hi>Animal Hunger</hi> of the Parts that have a Communication with the great Guts. The reſt of the <hi>Clyſters</hi> muſt be compos'd of <hi>ſoftening</hi> and <hi>cooling</hi> Ingredients.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:179659:257"/>
                     <p>Some thruſt a red-hot Iron thro' the Neck near the Main, in three or four ſeveral places, and others cut the Nerves: I look upon theſe Methods not only as unworthy to be recommended, but I think my ſelf oblig'd to diſſuade you from the Uſe of 'em; for the Horſe endures ſo much miſery already, that we ought by no means to encreaſe his Torments, without the leaſt Proſpect of future Relief.</p>
                     <p>If they cou'd be made to ſwallow any thing, it would be convenient to give 'em ſome Doſes of the <hi>Cordial-Powder</hi> or <hi>ſtinking Pills,</hi> or ſome other proper Medicine; but that is impoſſible, and you can only adminiſter external Remedies, which are ſeldom able to ſave the Horſe's Life.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive ſome encouraging Signs, or if the Horſe be in greater danger of dying of Hunger than of his Diſtemper, becauſe he is unable to take any Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if there be long and frequent Intermiſſions of his Fever, you may take the Advantage of one of thoſe Intervals, to prepare and exhibit the following Liquor. Mix a Pound of fine <hi>Barley-Flower</hi> with a ſufficient quanityt of Water, as if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to make <hi>Gruel,</hi> boil it till it begin to thicken, then add the quantity of an Egg of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and while 'tis moderately warm, inject it into the Horſe's Noſe, one half into each Noſtril.</p>
                     <p>Since the Paſſages of the Noſe end in the Mouth, you will perhaps be ſurpriz'd that I do not preſcribe this Nouriſhment to be given to the Horſe in the Beginning of the the Diſeaſe, when he ſtands ſo much in need of it, as not being able to take any Food at the Mouth: but I conſider that every thing that a Horſe takes by the Noſe does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fatigue and torment him, and therefore even the moſt <hi>cooling</hi> ſorts of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as <hi>Barley,</hi> given after that manner, might increaſe his <hi>Fever,</hi> if he has any, or throw him into a <hi>Fever</hi> tho' he were free of it before. For tho' this <hi>Fever</hi> be only accidental, and not much to be dreaded, 'tis nevertheleſs impoſſible to give any Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment by the Noſe without manifeſt hazard; and therefore I think we ought not to have recourſe to that Method, till the Horſe be in danger of ſtarving; in which caſe 'tis better to make an Attempt to ſave his Life tho' with ſome hazard, than to ſuffer him to die of Hunger.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Vives.</head>
                     <p>'TIS certainly a manifeſt Impropriety of Speech to ſay, that the Horſe has always the <hi>Vives,</hi> becauſe he always has thoſe Parts where that Diſtemper is ſeated, and ſhews it ſelf when he is actually troubl'd with it. Theſe are certain <hi>Glands</hi> or Kernels near the Neck, which being of a ſoft and ſpongy Subſtance, and held to be the Drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the neighbouring Parts, are ſubject to Inflammation, which cauſes a Swelling that obſtructs the Throat, and ſtops the Wind, ſo that if the Horſe be not ſpeedily aſſiſted, he is in danger of being choak'd. The Pain and Uneaſineſs occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the ſtoppage of his Wind, makes him lie down frequently, and immediately ſtart up again, tumble, ſtruggle, and toſs his Body after a ſtrange manner; thinking by theſe various Motions, to get rid of the Pain that torments and ſtifles him.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper may be very fitly compar'd to that which is call'd the <hi>Quinzie</hi> in Men.</p>
                     <p>'Tis thought that the <hi>Vives</hi> are always accompany'd with the <hi>Colic,</hi> becauſe the ſame Symptoms appear in both.</p>
                     <p>The moſt uſual Cauſe of this Diſeaſe is a ſudden Change from one Extremity to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially from a violent Heat to a ſharp Cold, as when a Horſe is ſuffer'd to drink immediately after hard Riding, or any vehement Exerciſe: for by this means the Humours are melted, and falling too plentifully on the Kernels, ſwell 'em, and occaſion all the above-mention'd Diſorders.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vives</hi> are alſo caus'd by over-working or riding a Horſe beyond his Strength, and out of Wind, or by neglecting to cover and walk him after violent Exerciſe; and a Horſe may bring 'em upon himſelf by eating too large a Quantity of <hi>Oats, Barley, Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Rye;</hi> beſides which they may proceed from ſeveral other Cauſes, which are almoſt always owing to the Indiſcretion either of the <hi>Rider</hi> or <hi>Groom.</hi>

                           <hi>Of Remedies for the</hi> Vives.</head>
                        <p>Bend the Horſe's Ear downwards towards his Throat near the Cheek-bone, and mark the place where it touches the Skin, for that is the Part where the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is ſeated that cauſes the Swelling; and if the Hair can be eaſily ſeparated from the Skin, by plucking it off with your hand, 'tis a Sign of Ripeneſs, and that 'tis time to reſolve, or at leaſt to give vent to the Matter contain'd in the Swelling. Then take hold of the <hi>Kernel</hi> which you will find in that Part, with a Pair of <hi>Pincers</hi> or <hi>Plyers,</hi> and beat the Swelling gently with the Handle of a <hi>Shooing-Hammer,</hi> till you judge it to be ſufficiently rotten, or bruiſe the <hi>Kernels</hi> or Tumours with your hand till the <hi>Vives</hi> be rotted and ſoften'd, making the flatuous or windy Spirits, break thro' the Skin by way of inſenſible Tranſpiration; after which the Swelling will certainly be reſolv'd and diſappear. This is the eaſieſt and ſureſt Method.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the general Cuſtom of Farriers to open the <hi>Vives</hi> with a Lance, making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion upon the <hi>Kernel</hi> or Swelling, out of which they take a certain Subſtance like the Fat of Beef, but harder, and afterwards ſtop the Hole with Salt. Others pinch forth the <hi>Vives</hi> out of the Inſide of the Ear, pretending that the ſame Matter that is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Kernels,</hi> which are the Seat of the <hi>Vives,</hi> is alſo contain'd in that part of the Ear: but this is a ridiculous Fancy.</p>
                        <p>'Tis better, in my Opinion, to <hi>rot</hi> the <hi>Vives</hi> than to <hi>open</hi> 'em, becauſe the laſt of theſe Methods renders the Horſes more obnoxious to this Diſtemper. Farriers think 'tis the ſafeſt way to open 'em, but I chuſe rather to corrupt 'em, unleſs the Swelling be ſo great that the Horſe is in danger of being ſtifl'd; in which caſe you muſt open 'em without delay to give Eaſe to the Horſe.</p>
                        <p>After you have <hi>rotted,</hi> or in Caſes of Neceſſity, <hi>open'd</hi> the <hi>Vives,</hi> bleed the Horſe under the Tongue, waſh his Mouth with Salt and Vinegar, blow ſome of the Vinegar into his Ears, rubbing and ſqueezing 'em hard to make it penetrate, for it powerfully aſſwages the Pain that is communicated to the Jaws, by reaſon of their Nearneſs to the Seat of the <hi>Vives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then take <hi>Hemp-ſeed</hi> beaten, two handfuls, two <hi>Nutmegs</hi> grated, and ſix <hi>Yolks of Eggs;</hi> mix 'em with a Quart of <hi>Wine,</hi> and make the Horſe drink it, walking him gently half an hour after. Sometimes the Diſtemper will not yield to this Remedy, in which Caſe, you muſt give the Horſe a good <hi>Clyſter</hi> with <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> and repeat the Remedy of <hi>Hemp-ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides you muſt not grow weary of walking him abroad: for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe rouzes the Natural Heat, and puts it in a Condition to reſiſt its Enemy. This I recommend as a very good and ſure Remedy; and beſides 'tis cheap, and eaſily prepar'd.</p>
                        <p>I can aſſure you from my own Obſervation, that 'tis a moſt preſent Remedy, to thruſt a <hi>Bodkin</hi> or <hi>Shooe-Maker</hi>'s <hi>Awl,</hi> quite thro' the Horſe's Noſtrils, two or three fingers breadth above their Opening. There will run out as much Blood on each ſide as would fill the Shell of an Egg, and then it will ſtop of it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time that you bleed him under the Tongue, you muſt alſo let him blood very plentifully in the Flanks, then cauſe him to be <hi>rak'd</hi> thus: Chuſe a Boy, or any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that has a little Hand, which you muſt make him beſmear with <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> and ſtretching it out at full length, with the Fingers join'd cloſe together, thruſt his Arm up to the Elbow into the Horſe's Fundament, and draw out his handful of Dung. But ſince a heedleſs and unskilful Fellow may hurt the great Gut with his Nails, the ſafeſt way is to thruſt a large <hi>Tallow Candle,</hi> or rather a Piece of <hi>Soap,</hi> into his Fundament, which will be quickly diſſolv'd, and bring out with it the Excrements contain'd in the great Gut.</p>
                        <p>When you have either taken out or rotted the <hi>Vives,</hi> an hour after you have given the above-mention'd <hi>Draught,</hi> it will be convenient to adminiſter the following <hi>Clyſter,</hi> to divert the Defluxion, and make an entire Revulſion.</p>

                     <p>I Shall firſt conſider that ſort of <hi>Colic</hi> which is occaſion'd by eating too much <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender;</hi> for the Stomach, being unable to digeſt ſo large a quantity of Food, is fill'd with Crudities, which in a manner ſtifle the natural Heat, tho' not without a conſiderable Struggle, which raiſes windy Vapours, that either fall upon the Guts or remain in the Stomach, cauſing violent Pains in whatever part they attack. This defect of Digeſtion rarely proves Mortal, unleſs (as it has been ſometimes obſerv'd) the Horſe be ſo gluttonous as to eat till he burſt, when he meets with a convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                     <p>A great quantity of <hi>Rye</hi> eaten unboil'd, is apt to occaſion theſe Pains, by reaſon of its Windineſs: <hi>Wheat</hi> is not ſo dangerous, becauſe more eaſily digeſted: <hi>Beans</hi> that are uſually given to Horſes to fatten 'em, breed this Diſtemper if they be eaten in too great abundance; and the ſame effect is produc'd by too large a quantity of <hi>Oats</hi> eaten at one time.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this ſort of <hi>Colic</hi> is perform'd by aſſiſting Nature to digeſt the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after you have empty'd the Guts with a convenient <hi>Clyſter:</hi> for you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give <hi>Vomits</hi> to Horſes, becauſe, inſtead of eaſing them they overturn the whole Oeconomy of Nature, and never procure Vomiting. The <hi>Clyſter</hi> muſt be compos'd of a Decoction that is endu'd with a vertue to diſcuſs Wind, to which you muſt add a Quart of <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> or a convenient quantity of the <hi>Infuſion of Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum.</hi>

                     <p>Aſſoon as the <hi>Clyſter</hi> is rejected, make the Horſe drink a Pint of <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> with an Ounce of <hi>Treacle,</hi> and as much <hi>Saffron</hi> as you can lift with the ends of your Fingers.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſtemper continue after the uſe of theſe Remedies, walk him abroad in his Cloaths, without ſuffering him to lie down; and after you have put him up in the Stable, hold a Warming-Pan full of live Coals under his Belly for a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, keeping him well cover'd.</p>
                     <p>Since <hi>Orvietan</hi> is not always to be had, it will not be improper to give a faithful deſcription of it; for it may be profitably given to Men, to Horn'd Cattle, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Horſes. It muſt be prepar'd by a skilful <hi>Apothecary.</hi>

                     <p>Chop the <hi>Walnuts,</hi> and beat 'em with the Bread, then ſtrain 'em thro' a Searce turn'd upſide down, adding the Powders and other Ingredients, and at laſt the <hi>Treacle</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> which ſerve inſtead of <hi>Leven</hi> to ferment the reſt.</p>
                     <p>This is the exact deſcription of <hi>Orvietan,</hi> which I dare warrant to be true, ſince that which I have ſeen thus prepar'd has the Taſte, Smell, Colour, Conſiſtency, and Vertue of the beſt <hi>Orvietan;</hi> ſo that you may confidently depend upon it, and make uſe of it, not only for Horſes but Men: 'Tis well known at <hi>Paris,</hi> where you may find it ready Prepar'd.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:179659:259"/>
                     <p>If <hi>Go at's-Rue</hi> cannot be had, you may ſubſtitute <hi>Cinque-foil</hi> in its ſtead; but the firſt is the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are willing, at any rate, to make the utmoſt Improvement of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, may add four Ounces of the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Livers</hi> of <hi>Vipers</hi> to the like quantity of the Powder of thoſe Animals, preſcrib'd in the Compoſition; but ſo conſiderable an Addition raiſes the Price of the Remedy ſo high, that 'tis only fit for Men, or Horſes of Value.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Orvietan</hi> is a durable Medicine, and of excellent uſe in all caſes that require Heat, or at leaſt where Heat is not to be avoided: 'Tis very uſeful for Horſes who have a weak Stomach, and little Appetite, or totally forſake their Meat; and for thoſe who have eaten a Venemous Plant or Animal, or are ſuſpected to be Poiſon'd. It raiſes lean and waſted Horſes, and deſtroys the <hi>Worms</hi> that breed in their Bodies, and make 'em pine away: But it muſt not be us'd till three Months after 'tis prepar'd, for ſo long it muſt ferment before it come to Perfection.</p>
                     <p>You may give it, by way of Prevention, to Horſes that have kept Company with others that were ſick of Contagious Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>It may be alſo given with good Succeſs to Oxen that are troubl'd with the <hi>Colic;</hi> it makes 'em Dung very plentifully, gives 'em preſent eaſe, and quickly Cures 'em: And beſides, it helps thoſe who have ſwallow'd a <hi>Spider,</hi> or any other Venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>You muſt give the <hi>Orvietan</hi> in <hi>Wine,</hi> and afterwards walk the Horſe, well cover'd, who will, perhaps, Sweat and recover. 'Tis generally good in all ſorts of <hi>Colics,</hi> and very rarely fails of Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>The Powder of <hi>Vipers</hi> alone is more effectual than <hi>Orvietan;</hi> but 'tis dear, and to be had only at certain Times, when 'tis brought from <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe Parts where <hi>Vipers</hi> abound; and beſides, a Horſe would require half an Ounce of it for a Doſe.</p>
                     <p>They who are not willing or able to beſtow the neceſſary Charge on the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Medicine, may uſe the <hi>Treacle,</hi> call'd <hi>Diateſſeron,</hi> which I uſe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and find to be very effectual. See the Deſcription of it in the Fiftieth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>They who know how to prepare <hi>Eſſence of Vipers,</hi> need not trouble themſelves with <hi>Orvietan;</hi> for the former has all the Virtues of the latter, without leaving the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Heat: It purines the Blood, reſiſts Corruption, and conſumes all Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the Stomach, and ſo undermines and deſtroys the very Root of Diſeaſes: Beſides, it cures the <hi>Farcin;</hi> but for all its excellent Virtues, few are acquainted with the true manner of preparing it, or at leaſt, few are willing to undergo the trouble, (for 'tis not ſo great a Secret, as ſome who make a Myſtery of every thing, would perſwade the World) and therefore I thought fit to ſubjoin the Deſcription of it.</p>

                     <p>Then mix one part of this Solution of <hi>Vipers</hi> with three parts of diſtill'd <hi>Cordial-Waters,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> or <hi>Juniper</hi>-Water, and give it a fine yellow Colour, with two or three Chives of <hi>Saffron.</hi> This is that <hi>Eſſence of Vipers</hi> which is ſo much extoll'd, and ſold ſo very dear.</p>

                     <p>THE moſt uſual ſort of <hi>Colic</hi> is that which proceeds from <hi>Wind,</hi> to which Horſes who are given to <hi>Ticking</hi> are very ſubject; for the exerciſe of that ill Habit fills their Body with Wind, which afterwards produces <hi>Gripings.</hi> If the Horſe be not ſwoln, one ſimple<note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>That diſcuſſes Wind.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Carminative Clyſter</hi> will, for the moſt part, be ſufficient to perfect the Cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen,</hi> one of the great Luminaries of Phyſic, aſcribes the Original of the Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or Wind, which is generated in the Body to a middle degree of Heat, ſtrong enough to raiſe Vapours from a cold and viſcous Humour, but not ſufficiently vigorous to diſperſe 'em after they are rais'd. For meer Cold is wholly deſtitute of a Power to attenuate, digeſt, or diſſolve, and therefore can never produce Wind; and on the other ſide, a Heat that acts upon the Humours with a force conſiderably Superior to their Reſiſtance, makes 'em too thin to generate Wind, which probably proceeds from a weaker degree of Heat, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Galen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When theſe Windy Vapours abound in the Body, they ſtretch and diſtend the Guts beyond their due meaſure, and occaſion violent Pains. Beſides, they blow up the Horſe's Body as if it were ready to burſt, which Swelling is the moſt peculiar ſign of the <hi>Wind-Colic,</hi> in which, as in all the other Kinds of that Diſtemper, the Horſe tumbles and toſſes with extraordinary violence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wind</hi> may alſo occaſion that painful and dangerous kind of <hi>Colic,</hi> call'd, <hi>Convolvulus,</hi> which is a Motion of the Inteſtines againſt Nature, tending from below upwards, and may proceed either from the Irritation of the Spirits, or the malignant Fermentation of the Excrements retain'd in the Guts. The violence of this Diſtemper will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated by the uſe of the following Remedies, but almoſt always it proves Mortal at laſt, and when a Horſe dies of it, Farriers uſually ſay that he had the <hi>Red-Colic.</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:179659:260"/>The ſame Remedies that are good for the <hi>Wind-Colic,</hi> are alſo us'd in this caſe, but with littleſ ucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The cure of the <hi>Wind-Colic</hi> is perform'd by Bleeding the Horſe in the Flanks, and under the Tongue, and by walking him frequently; for Exerciſe rouzes and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorates the natural Heat, and enables it to diſpel the Wind that cauſes the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Cover him well, and walk him at a Trot, and ſometimes at a Foot-pace; and if the Violence of the Pain be not abated, give him the following Clyſter, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before many other Remedies.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>I have often had experience of the admirable Efficacy of this Clyſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may boldly recommend it to all thoſe who ſhall have occaſion to uſe it. Take a Pound of large fat <hi>Figs,</hi> chop'd, boil 'em in three Quarts of Water for a full half Hour; then add two handfuls of <hi>Rue</hi> cut ſinall, and boil 'em again pretty briskly for a quarter of an hour; After the Liquor is half cool'd, ſtrain it out, and pour off two Quarts of the cleareſt, throwing away the reſt. In this Decoction diſſolve half a Pound of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> and inject the whole luke-warm; after which, walk the Horſe before you put him up in the Stable. This <hi>Clyſter</hi> will draw all the <hi>Wind</hi> into the ſtraight Gut, and afterwards expel it: It uſually remains a great while in the Body, and for that reaſon works more effectually.</p>

                        <p>If the Horſe be not cur'd by this <hi>Clyſter,</hi> an hour after he has rejected it, give him a Pound of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> mixt with a Quart of <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> pouring it in with a Horn; then walk him abroad well cover'd, making him Trot one quarter of an hour, and go a Foot-pace another.</p>

Reduce the Herbs to Powder, beat the Seeds, and put 'em all together in an Earthen glaz'd Pot, covering it with another Pot ſomewhat leſs, and luted with Clay or Paſte. Boil 'em over a flow Fire till half the Wine be conſum'd, that is, about ſix hours.

                     <p>Three or four Ounces of this <hi>Oil</hi> in an ordinary <hi>Clyſter,</hi> will expel the Wind effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and bring forth the tough and viſcous Humours, which for the moſt part occaſion this Diſtemper.

                     <p>THis Kind is not ſo eaſily known as the two former, and often puts an end to the Horſe's Life, which the other Kinds rarely do. 'Tis caus'd by a ſort of <hi>Glaſſy Phlegm,</hi> that owes its Sharpneſs either to its Rottenneſs and Corruption, or to its Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and biting Quality, and forces Nature to violent Strugglings, which produce thoſe cruel and intolerable Pains that accompany this Diſeaſe. The Horſe endeavours in vain to dung; he ſweats in the Flank and Ears, and when he voids any Excrements they are in little quantity, and for the moſt part only Phlegm, that cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Guts without Pain; after which he has a moment of Eaſe, and ſeems to be perfectly cur'd; but his Torments return in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>During the raging Violence of the Pain the Horſe frequently lies down, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtarts up again, he looks upon his Flanks, and refuſes to eat.

                     <p>This Diſtemper is often preceded by a Looſeneſs, which laſts a whole day, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off all the groſs Excrements in the Horſe's Body; but the tough and glewy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſtick to the Guts, and do not quit their hold ſo ſoon, nor at laſt without a great deal of Pain.</p>

All <hi>Purgatives</hi> given at the Mouth are hurtful, for they encreaſe the Agitation of the Humours, redouble the Pain, by violently plucking away the tough Slime, flay the Guts, add new Torments to a Part that was hardly able to ſupport thoſe it ſuffer'd before, and cannot be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd without endangering the Horſe's Life: and beſides they do not begin to operate till four and twenty hours after they are taken; during which time the Horſe either dies or recovers. And therefore inſtead of <hi>purging</hi> Medicines, that are uſually preſcrib'd in this Caſe, I adviſe you to have recourſe to <hi>Clyſters,</hi> which muſt be often repeated and chang'd, according to the various Circumſtances of the Diſeaſe; for ſometimes you muſt give a <hi>ſoftening Clyſter</hi> to aſſwage the Pain, ſometimes add <hi>Antimonium diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum,</hi> to melt the Humours, and if the Diſtemper be of long continuance, inject
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179659:261"/>one of <hi>Milk</hi> or <hi>Tripe-Broth.</hi> It will alſo be convenient to give the following Mixture at ſeveral times; take <hi>Oil of Roſes</hi> and common <hi>Oil,</hi> of each one Pound, fine <hi>Sugar</hi> eight Ounces, <hi>Roſe-water</hi> a Pint; Mix 'em, and pour a Glaſs-full down his Throat with a Horn every three hours. This eaſie and familiar Remedy will open and ſcour the Guts, cut the thick Humours, allay the Pain, and by its Slipperineſs gliding thro' the Inteſtines, qualifie the Sharpneſs and Heat of the Humours: After every Doſe walk the Horſe gently a quarter of an hour, without heating him, leſt the Humours be further enrag'd.</p>
                        <p>When you perceive that the Horſe is freed of his Pain, feed him with <hi>Bran</hi> ſeven or eight days, after which, ſince this Diſtemper is only appeas'd but not perfectly cur'd, you muſt endeavour to remove the Cauſe, and expel thoſe Impurities from whence the <hi>Colic</hi> proceeds, by a convenient <hi>Purgation.</hi> The following <hi>Oil</hi> is endu'd with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Virtue to drive out the tough and glaſſy Phlegm, that occaſion'd all the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Diſorders in the Inteſtines.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XLVI. <hi>An excellent</hi> Purging Oil.</head>
                     <p>THE adminiſtring of <hi>purging</hi> Medicines to a Horſe, is one of the hardeſt parts of a Farrier's Task, and therefore I thought my ſelf oblig'd to uſe the utmoſt Diligence and Application to find out a ſafe and ſucceſsful Method of <hi>Purgation:</hi> but notwithſtanding all my Endeavours to prevent the Inconveniencies that attend the Uſe of thoſe Medicines, I obſerv'd an extreme Repugnancy in the Nature of Horſes to yield to their Operation, and I found by Experience, that <hi>purgative</hi> Remedies are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by ſuch an univerſal Diſorder in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Nature, that the Horſe cannot be reſtor'd to his wonted Temper for a conſiderable time afterwards. I will not trouble my Reader witha particular Account of thoſe Inconveniencies, but content my ſelf with aſſuring him that I have ſeen more Horſes than one kill'd by <hi>purging</hi> Remedies that had been ſucceſsfully adminiſter'd to others, for want of a due Preparation of their Bodies, according to that Maxim of <hi>Hippocrates, Concocta medicamentis aggredi opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet &amp; movere, non cruda.</hi> I ſhall treat of this <hi>Preparation</hi> in a more convenient place, and now proceed to acquaint you, that I have ſeen ſome Horſes <hi>founder'd</hi> by the Uſe of <hi>Purgatives,</hi> and others continue to purge ten Days and as many Nights, during which time they were in perpetual danger; and thoſe who tended 'em (and I my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) were forc'd to pour down their Nouriſhment with a Horn. So many unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trials have taught me Circumſpection, and I never purge a Horſe without fear, tho' Neceſſity often obliges us to make uſe of thoſe Remedies, and a due obſervance of the true Method of adminiſtring 'em may prevent their fatal Conſequences. I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd theſe things with the utmoſt Attention, and after a careful Examination of all Circumſtances, I find <hi>Van Helmont</hi>'s Opinion to be very reaſonable, and I'm perſuaded that his Arguments are infinitely more convincing than all that had been urg'd by others before him. But ſince I am not Maſter of a ſufficient Stock of Learning to explain his Maxims, and reduce 'em to Practice, and cannot attempt to overturn the receiv'd Method of Practiſing Phyſic, without invading a Province that does not belong to me; I muſt even content my ſelf with following the Multitude, till ſome Perſon of greater Judgment and Authority ſhall undertake the Reformation of Medicine, by extirpating all <hi>Purgatives,</hi> and ſubſtituting ſome powerful <hi>Diaphoretic</hi> in their ſtead, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame Effects we expect from the others, and deſtroy that preternatural Heat which is the Root of all theſe Diſorders. However I thought my ſelf indiſpenſably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to enquire into the ſafeſt Methods of <hi>Purging</hi> Horſes; and I'm convinc'd that the following <hi>Oil</hi> is one of the moſt proper Remedies hitherto known, to move a Horſe's Belly without Diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> three Pounds, <hi>Claret-Wine</hi> a Pint, <hi>Pulp</hi> of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> five Ounces, <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Lin-ſeed</hi> an Ounce and a half, three <hi>Lilly-Roots</hi> cut into round ſlices, <hi>Miſsleto of the Apple-Tree</hi> beaten, an Ounce, <hi>Cammomil-flowers</hi> a handful. Put all the Ingredients into a Pot cover'd exactly with another ſomewhat leſs, and lute the Junctures of the Veſſels with Clay temper'd with a little Hair or Wool: after the Clay is dry'd, boil the whole Compoſition gently till the Wine be conſum'd, that is eight or ten hours; then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179659:262"/>remove it from the Fire, and when 'tis half cold ſtrain it thro' a Linnen Cloth, and give one half luke-warm to the Horſe, for the whole quantity is ſufficient to purge two Horſes; but if he be naturally hard to be wrought upon by <hi>purging</hi> Medicines, give him more of it afterwards, proportionably to his Strength; for 'tis better to divide the Doſe than to endanger the Horſe's Life by <hi>Superpurgation.</hi> This <hi>Oil</hi> may be kept Ten Years, without the leaſt Alteration or Diminution of its Virtue; and therefore you may prepare a ſufficient quantity at one time to ſerve four or ſix Horſes, and you may alſo uſe it in <hi>Clyſters,</hi> if need require.</p>
                     <p>Keep the Horſe bridl'd ſix hours before, and five hours after the taking of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which muſt be given in a Pint of <hi>Broth,</hi> made with <hi>Tripes, Sheep's-Head,</hi> or ſome other kind of Fleſh, but without any mixture of Fat, and then walk him about an hour. Thoſe who keep many Horſes, and even profeſs'd Farriers, may prepare large quantities of this <hi>Oil;</hi> and keep it by 'em till they have occaſion to uſe it.</p>
                     <p>Tho' <hi>Coloquintida</hi> be an Enemy to the Guts, and therefore may ſeem ſuſpicious in a Diſeaſe that is ſeated in thoſe Parts; yet its ſharp and venomous Quality being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd by the <hi>Oil,</hi> it may be very ſafely given eſpecially in <hi>Broth</hi> made with <hi>Tripes,</hi> or <hi>Sheeps-Heads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Oil</hi> may alſo ſerve to purge thoſe Horſes that remain lean and meagre after hard Labour, without any manifeſt Diſtemper.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XLVII. <hi>Of the</hi> Fourth <hi>Kind of</hi> Colic.</head>
                     <p>THis Kind of <hi>Colic</hi> is occaſion'd by <hi>Worms,</hi> which ſtick to the Stomach and great Guts, and cauſe ſuch violent and intolerable Pains, that the tormented Horſe is driven to the moſt deſperate Actions, and ſometimes lies ſtretch'd on the Ground as if he were dead.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Worms</hi> or <hi>Truncheons,</hi> that cauſe thoſe <hi>Gripings,</hi> are uſually broad, thick, and ſhort, like little <hi>Beans</hi> of a red Colour: there are others long and white, ſharp at both Ends; but theſe are not ſo dangerous as the former, and ſeldom gripe the Horſe. Theſe little <hi>Worms</hi> gnaw and pierce the Guts, from whence proceed the intolerable Pains with which the Horſe is tormented: I mean the <hi>firſt</hi> Kind of <hi>Worms,</hi> that occaſion all theſe Diſorders, and even ſomtimes eat Holes thro' the Maw, and kill the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>You may conclude that the Pain proceeds from <hi>Worms,</hi> when you find 'em among the Horſe's Dung: but the <hi>red</hi> Sort is not eaſily diſcern'd, being almoſt of the ſame Colour with the Excrements. You may alſo know that the Horſe is troubl'd with 'em, when during the Violence of the Pain he bites his Flanks or Belly, and tears off part of his Skin, as if he were mad; afterwards he will turn his Head, and look upon his Belly, ſweat all over the Body, throw himſelf upon the ground, ſtart up again, and put himſelf into ſeveral unuſual Poſtures.</p>
                     <p>Since I deſign afterwards to deſcribe all the various Kinds of <hi>Worms</hi> that are generated in the Bodies of Horſes, I ſhall here confine my ſelf to the proper Subject of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Worms,</hi> mix half an Ounce of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> with an Ounce and a half of old <hi>Treacle,</hi> and make up the whole into three Pills, which muſt be given in a Pint of <hi>Claret.</hi> An hour after inject a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of two Quarts of <hi>Milk,</hi> with the <hi>Yolks</hi> of ſix <hi>Eggs,</hi> and a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Sugar,</hi> which by its Sweetneſs will entice the <hi>Worms</hi> to the ſtreight Gut. The beſt <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> may be had for fifteen Pence the Ounce. See the Hundred and fifty eighth Chapter, where you will find ſeveral ways to deſtroy <hi>Worms,</hi> by <hi>Purgation, Powders, Potions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of my Acquaintance having ſent to a little Town for half an Ounce of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> the Apothecary ſent him <hi>corroſive Sublimate,</hi> which he gave without ſcruple to his Horſe, who dy'd of it; and after his Body was open'd the Diſorders caus'd by the Poiſon appear'd in his <hi>Throat</hi> and <hi>Maw;</hi> for the <hi>Quid pro Quo</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too ſtrong on this occaſion. To prevent ſuch dangerous Cheats, you muſt make the Apothecary put ſome of the <hi>Mercury</hi> on the tip of his Tongue, for that which is truly prepar'd is ſo free from all manner of Sharpneſs, that it will not ſo much as prick the Tongue, and I my ſelf uſually taſte it, without either Fear or Danger. But
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179659:262"/>if it be <hi>corroſive Sublimate,</hi> he will either refuſe to taſte it, or only touch it very ſlightly.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other <hi>Powders</hi> preſcrib'd for killing <hi>Worms,</hi> of which I ſhall treat in time and place convenient; but <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> is the moſt effectual; for the Vapour of it alone kills all manner of Worms: yet if this fail you may have recourſe to other Remedies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clyſters</hi> that are given to Horſes troubl'd with <hi>Worms,</hi> may be made of <hi>Tripe-Broth,</hi> or <hi>Barley-water,</hi> boil'd with <hi>Agrimony</hi> and <hi>Purſlane,</hi> of each one handful. In this Liquor diſſolve half a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> the <hi>Yolks</hi> of eight <hi>Eggs,</hi> half a Pound of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and inject it blood-warm; for by reaſon of its Sweetneſs it will draw thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Inſects to the ſtreight Gut.</p>

The Compoſition of it follows.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Maſter-wort, Leaves</hi> and <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Raddiſhes,</hi> greater <hi>Centory,</hi> and <hi>Tanſy;</hi> Dry 'em in the Sun, in the Summer, and in an Oven with a moderate degree of Heat, in the Winter; then take a Pound of each, <hi>Germander, Ground-pine, Roots</hi> of <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Elecampane,</hi> all dry'd in the Shade, of each half a Pound, <hi>Corallin</hi> or <hi>Sea-Moſs,</hi> and <hi>Liver-Aloes,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Galingal, Nutmeg,</hi> and <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> of each two Ounces; Reduce all the Ingredients to Powder ſeparately, then mix em, and keep 'em in a Leathern-Bag, or Glaſs-Bottle cloſe ſtopp'd. The Doſe is an Ounce for ſmall Horſes, two Ounces for thoſe of a middle Size, and two Ounces and a half for the largeſt Horſes. Mix it with half an Ounce or three Drams of old <hi>Treacle,</hi> or an Ounce of <hi>Treacle diateſſaron,</hi> or <hi>Mithridate;</hi> then give it the Horſe in a Pint of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> and afterwards walk him in his Cloaths.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who travel with ſeveral Horſes, ought always to make proviſion of this <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> not only by reaſon of its excellent Virtues, but becauſe Horſes are frequently ſeiz'd with the <hi>Colic</hi> at a diſtance from any place where they may have Aſſiſtance, and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Hours.</p>
                     <p>If you ſuſpect that the Diſeaſe is occaſion'd by <hi>Worms,</hi> ſince many are poſſeſs'd with groundleſs Prejudices againſt <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> I ſhall propoſe another Remedy which will produce the ſame Effect; but I muſt firſt acquainnt you that you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly kill all the <hi>Worms</hi> in a Horſe's Body, by giving him an Ounce and a half of the above-mention'd Powder, mix'd with half an Ounce of <hi>Mercurius dulcis.</hi> If this Preparation of <hi>Mercury</hi> cannot be had, or if you be afraid to uſe it, you may give the following <hi>Purgative,</hi> above two days at leaſt after the Fit is over.</p>

                        <p>Eight Hours after the taking of this Remedy, give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of <hi>Cow's-Milk, Whey,</hi> or <hi>Tripe-Broth,</hi> adding half a Pound of clarifi'd <hi>Honey,</hi> with the <hi>Yolks</hi> of ſix <hi>Eggs,</hi> to allure the Worms to the ſtraight Gut.</p>

                        <p>If you put the <hi>Turpentine</hi> into the Water, before you beat it with <hi>Yolks</hi> of <hi>Eggs,</hi> it will grow hard as a Stone, and communicate no Virtue to the <hi>Clyſter.</hi> But to avoid the trouble of diſſolving it, you may mix two Ounces of <hi>Spirit of Turpentine</hi> with the <hi>Clyſters,</hi> which provokes Urine more effectually.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as the <hi>Clyſter</hi> is rejected, give your Horſe two Ounces of Powder of <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony</hi> in a Pint of <hi>White-Wine;</hi> then walk him, and he will certainly <hi>Stale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or, Boil two Ounces of <hi>Anni-ſeed</hi> in a Quart of Water, add the weight of a Crown of <hi>Wood-Lice,</hi> in Powder, and give it luke-warm. This is an eaſie Remedy, and does not heat the Horſe.</p>
                        <p>If all theſe Remedies prove in effectual, anoint his Sheath and Stones with <hi>Garlick,</hi> beaten and mixt with <hi>Oil-Olive;</hi> that is, take five or ſix Heads of <hi>Garlick,</hi> beat 'em, and make an <hi>Ointment</hi> with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Oil,</hi> with which rub his Sheath and Stones. If he be a Gelding, let his Yard be drawn gently out of the Sheath, and after all the Filth is waſh'd off with luke-warm Water, rub the whole outſide of the Sheath with the Mixture of <hi>Garlic</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> which will give him a deſire to <hi>Stale</hi> if he can; for ſome Horſes have an Inclination to Piſs, but cannot.</p>
                        <p>If this Application do not provoke Urine, mix Powder of <hi>Wood-Lice</hi> dry'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burning, and reduc'd to the form of an <hi>Ointment</hi> with <hi>Oil,</hi> and anoint as before, after which the Horſe will <hi>Stale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Quart of <hi>Emetic White-Wine,</hi> given with a Horn, will certainly make the Horſe Piſs, if he be walk'd after it, both at a Trot and a Foot-Pace. I have already taught you how to make this Wine in the Twenty third Chapter; but ſince 'tis too late to prepare that Remedy after your Horſe begins to be troubl'd with a ſtoppage of Urine, you may take <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony</hi> (which you will find deſcrib'd in <hi>Glazer's Chymiſtry,</hi> and afterwards in this Book) and fine <hi>Wheat-Flower,</hi> of each an Ounce, mix 'em well in a Mortar, and give the whole Powder to the Horſe in a Quart of <hi>White-Wine:</hi> It provokes Urine more effectually than any Wine whatſoever. You may find this Medicine at the Shops of ſome curious Apothecaries: It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Glauber,</hi> who calls it his <hi>Panacaea,</hi> or <hi>Univerſal Remedy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may put a couple of <hi>Lice</hi> or <hi>Bugs</hi> to the end of the Horſe's Yard, to rouſe the expulſive Faculty.</p>
                        <p>During the uſe of thoſe Remedies, it will be convenient to foment the Reins thus, boil two Buſhels of <hi>Oats</hi> in a mixture of <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> till the <hi>Oats</hi> burſt under your Finger, then apply 'em in a Bag to the Horſe's Reins or Back, as hot as he can well endure, about the place where the Saddle ends. If you have not <hi>Oats,</hi> you may make uſe of <hi>Rye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Fomentation provokes Urine effectually; but if the expulſive faculty be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, beat <hi>Darnel,</hi> and boil it in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and anoint the Yard and Stones with the Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Thruſt your Hand into the Horſe's Fundament, and <hi>rake</hi> him, then preſs the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gently with your Hand, and the Horſe will infallibly <hi>Stale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If theſe Remedies prove ineffectual, chuſe the whiteſt <hi>Flints</hi> you can find on the Banks of ſome rapid River, heat 'em red-hot, and quench 'em in a Pint and a half of ſtrong <hi>White-Wine,</hi> heating and quenching 'em ſo often, till they crumble into Powder, then ſtrain the Wine thro' a Linnen-Cloth doubl'd, and make the Horſe drink it; for the Wine being impregnated with the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Flints,</hi> which is a powerful <hi>Diuretic,</hi> will certainly make the Horſe <hi>Stale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sal-Prunellae,</hi> or <hi>Cryſtal-mineral</hi> clears the Paſſages, and removes the Obſtructions that ſtop the Urine; but you muſt not depend upon it during the Fit, for its vertue principally conſiſts in preventing the Stoppage of Urine in thoſe Horſes who uſually
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:179659:264"/>endeavour to <hi>Stale,</hi> but cannot, by reaſon of a certain Heat or Obſtruction in the Paſſages; in which caſe, you muſt give the Horſe every day in his <hi>Bran,</hi> an Ounce of <hi>Sal-Prunellae,</hi> and a Dram of <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> till he has conſum'd a whole Pound.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sal-Prunellae</hi> cools the Bowels, clears the Paſſages, rectifies the Blood, and would be an admirable Medicine, if it were not apt to cool the Stomach too much, and make the Horſe loſe his Appetite; for which reaſon I added a Grain of <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the Stomach, without over-heating the Body: But if the Horſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, forſake his Meat, you muſt not continue to give him the <hi>Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineral.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take about four Ounces of dry'd <hi>Pigeon's Dung</hi> in Powder, boil it in a Quart of White-Wine, and after two or three waums, ſtrain out the Liquor, and give it Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm to the Horſe: then walk him for half an Hour, and he will <hi>Stale</hi> if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I know ſome Men who took a Dram of this <hi>Dung</hi> in a Glaſs of Wine for the <hi>Colic,</hi> and receiv'd great benefit by it.</p>
                        <p>One of the beſt Remedies for a Horſe that cannot <hi>Stale,</hi> is to carry him into a <hi>Sheep-cote,</hi> and there to unbridle him, ſuffering him to ſmell the Dung, and roll and wallow in it; for he will infallibly Piſs before he come forth, if he be not paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. This quick Effect proceeds from a certain Volatil, Subtil, and Diuretic <hi>Salt,</hi> that exhales from the <hi>Sheeps-Dung,</hi> and ſtrikes the Brain; for, by reaſon of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of that with the lower Parts, it obliges the expulſive Faculty to void the Urine. It would be needleſs to prove, that this <hi>Dung</hi> is full of ſuch a <hi>Salt,</hi> ſince the Truth of that Suppoſition is ſufficiently confirm'd by the great quantity of <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> which may be ſo eaſily extracted out of it.</p>
                        <p>The Urinary Paſſages are frequently ſtop'd by thick <hi>Flegm,</hi> which will hardly be remov'd by the above-mention'd Remedies, and therefore you may have recourſe to that which follows, and I'm confident you will not loſe your Labour.</p>

                           <hi>Oil of yellow Amber</hi> is one of the moſt effectual Remedies to make a Horſe <hi>Stale.</hi> The Doſe is a Spoonful in a Pint of White-Wine, and you muſt walk him after it.</p>
                        <p>This Medicine is eaſily procur'd, ſince almoſt all Apothecaries have it, or at leaſt ought to have it. It muſt be made without Addition, and not rectifi'd: Its excellent Vertues make amends for its noiſome Smell. 'Tis ſo powerful a <hi>Diuretic,</hi> that the Steams or ſubtil Spirits that are evaporated from it, during its Preparation make the Artiſt Piſs exceſſively.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who are deſirous to know how 'tis made, may conſult <hi>Crollius</hi>'s <hi>Baſilica Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica,</hi> or <hi>Hartman</hi>'s <hi>Praxis Chymiatrica, Glazer</hi>'s <hi>Treatiſe of Chymiſtry,</hi> and ſeveral other Authors who treat of that Art. I preferr this Remedy before all the reſt I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, for it ſeldom or never fails.</p>
                        <p>Another eaſie Remedy for ſtoppage of Urine, is to waſh the Horſe's Yard with luke-warm Water, then Powder it all over with <hi>Salt,</hi> and ſuffer him to draw it in; if it be a Mare, put the quantity of a Walnut of <hi>Salt</hi> into her Privity.</p>
                        <p>Another good Remedy is to make him drink a Quart of <hi>Verjuice</hi> in half a Pail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Water; and if he refuſe to drink it, (which few Horſes do) mix a Quart of Water with a like quantity of <hi>Verjuice,</hi> and pour it into his Throat with a Horn: Then walk him, and he will <hi>Stale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that I ought rather to have propos'd one ſure Remedy, than ſuch a multitude of different Medicines, among which few know how to make a good choice: I ſhall only anſwer, that I have try'd 'em all, and leave the Reader to chuſe ſuch Medicines as are moſt proper for his Horſe, and may be moſt conveniently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179659:264"/>For ſome of thoſe Remedies are leſs Compound than others, and the Diſeaſe is more or leſs obſtinate in ſeveral Caſes: Beſides, one Horſe may receive no benefit by the uſe of a Remedy that has cur'd ſeveral others of the ſame Diſtemper, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the variety of Cauſes. Some Horſes are alſo frequently troubl'd with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and ſometimes die of it: And from all theſe Conſiderations laid together, it will appear, that I had reaſon to preſcribe ſo many different Remedies. I have ſeen a great number of Horſes loſt by the Ignorance of thoſe who undertook to Cure 'em: For thoſe pretended Artiſts endeavour'd only to make 'em <hi>Stale,</hi> tho' the Diſeaſe was truly a <hi>Wind-Colic.</hi> On the other ſide, moſt Farriers and Grooms imagine, that a Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Gripes,</hi> when his Urine is ſuppreſt, and that Miſtake is ſo ſtrongly rooted in 'em, that 'tis impoſſible to convince 'em of their Error. So that when a Horſe is troubl'd with a Stoppage of Urine, and the Farriers pretend that the Diſtemper proceeds from the <hi>Gripes,</hi> you may certainly conclude that they are miſtaken, and that the Diſeaſe is an effect of another Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>When the ſtoppage of Urine is occaſion'd by a confirm'd Obſtruction, or by an Inflammation of the Neck of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> you muſt not perſiſt in the uſe of Internal Medicines to provoke Urine, which would only ſerve to encreaſe the Pain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and ſtifle the natural Heat, by driving vaſt quantities of ſerous and flegmatic Humours into the <hi>Bladder.</hi> But inſtead of theſe, you may ſafely apply the external Remedies deſcrib'd in this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>It was never obſerv'd hitherto, that Horſes were ſubject to the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Gravel,</hi> or that the ſtoppage of Urine that occaſions this kind of <hi>Colic,</hi> was ever occaſion'd by <hi>Sand</hi> or <hi>Gravel.</hi> Nevertheleſs, in the Year 1668. an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe died in our <hi>Academy,</hi> after a Sickneſs of ſome Hours, during which he Sweat all over the Body. To diſcover the Cauſe of ſo cruel a Diſtemper, I order'd his Body to be open'd by our Farrier, who found in his <hi>Kidneys</hi> a Stone that weigh'd four Pounds and two Ounces, brown and ſhining like poliſh'd Marble, reſembling a little <hi>Dutch</hi> Cheeſe, and of a very regular Figure, for it was not the breadth of a Line thicker on one ſide than on the other. Both its Figure and Weight have remain'd entire ever ſince, and it has been ſeen by almoſt all the People of <hi>Paris</hi> with admiration. I preſented it to my good Friend Count <hi>Bertholin,</hi> who made all thoſe who ſaw it taken out of the Horſe's Body, atteſt the truth of the matter of Fact, before a <hi>Notary.</hi> He preſerves it ſtill, and ſhows it to all thoſe who deſire a ſight of it; nor could I forbear relating ſo unuſual an Accident.</p>

                        <p>Having already diſcours'd of the <hi>Stoppage</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> I ſhall proceed, in the next place, to give an account of the Cauſe and Cure of a contrary Diſtemper, in which the Horſe voids an exceſſive quantity of crude, and undigeſted Urine reſembling Water, and at laſt dies, not being able to ſupport the long continuance of ſuch an immoderate Evacuation. This <hi>Flux</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> is occaſion'd by the Heat and Sharpneſs of the Blood, and an Inflammation of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> which, like <hi>Cupping-Glaſſes,</hi> ſuck all the ſerous Humours out of the <hi>Veins,</hi> and diſcharge 'em into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> every thing that the Horſe drinks paſſing immediately thro' his Body, without the leaſt Alteration.</p>
                        <p>The remote Cauſes of this Diſtemper are, Immoderate and Irregular Exerciſe, or Working of young Horſes, cold Rains in the beginning of Winter, and eating of Oats that are Imported by Sea, where, being of a ſpongy Nature, they imbibe and ſuck in the volatile ſaline Spirits that riſe out of the Sea.</p>
                        <p>When you undertake the Cure of this Diſeaſe, in the firſt place you muſt order the Horſe's Diet, feeding him with <hi>Bran</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> and give him a <hi>cooling Clyſter;</hi> next day let him Blood, and the day after inject another <hi>Clyſter,</hi> after which Bleed him again the following day. The whole quantity of Blood that is taken away muſt not exceed <hi>four Pounds,</hi> that is, <hi>two</hi> at each time.</p>
                        <p>After you have let Blood twice, and injected two <hi>Clyſters,</hi> boil two Quarts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and put it into a Pail-full of common Water, with a large handful of <hi>Oriental Bole</hi> beaten to Powder. Mix the whole very well, and make the Horſe drink it luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, if it be poſſible, neither muſt you give him any other Liquor for his ordinary drink Morning or Evening.</p>
                        <p>Horſes that are troubl'd with this Diſtemper drink exceſſively; and ſome of 'em are ſo thirſty, and their Bodies ſo heated, that they would drink ſix Pail-fulls of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every day. You muſt not reſtrain 'em, but let 'em have their full liberty to drink
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179659:265"/>as much as they pleaſe, provided the Water be prepar'd as before with boiling Water and <hi>Bole;</hi> for the more they drink, the ſooner will they be cur'd.</p>
                        <p>When the Horſe begins to <hi>Stale</hi> as he us'd to do when in Health, and his Belly and Dung return to their natural Condition, you muſt reſtore his <hi>Oats</hi> by degrees, exerciſe him moderately at firſt, and afterwards Ride or Work him with diſcretion.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. L. <hi>Of a Horſe that</hi> Stales Blood.</head>
                     <p>DUring the great Heats of Summer, if a Horſe be ridden long and hard, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated by immoderate Exerciſe, he will Piſs pure <hi>Blood;</hi> and this Diſeaſe is frequently Mortal, eſpecially if ſome Vein or large Veſſel be broken, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the Blood into the Bladder. Some Horſes Piſs Blood abundantly without a Fever, loſs of Appetite, or any other appearance of Indiſpoſition; in which caſe the Flux of Blood proceeds only from the exceſſive Heat of the Kidneys, and may be eaſily cur'd. It would ſeem indeed that they could not long bear ſo vaſt an expence of Blood; but ſince a little Blood will ſerve to tinge a great quantity of Urine, 'tis commonly thought that all they Piſs is pure Blood, whereas oftentimes the tenth part of it is not Blood, and if proper Remedies be applied, during the firſt days of the Diſtemper, the Cure will be eaſily accompliſh'd. I ſhall forbear giving a particular Account of the Cauſes and Conſequences of this Diſeaſe, out of complaiſance to thoſe who are profeſt Enemies to Speculation, and only look for Remedies in a Book of this nature.</p>
                     <p>Bleed the Horſe, and give him every Morning three Pints of White-Wine made <hi>Emetic,</hi> by the Infuſion of unwaſh'd <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Liver of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> The <hi>Nitre</hi> will give the Wine a red Colour, and make it of admirable efficacy; for it will both Cleanſe and Heal, which are the two main Scopes of the Cure. Keep your Horſe Bridl'd four Hours before you give him the Wine, and as long after: Repeat the Doſe everyd ay, and in ſix or ſeven Days the Flux of Blood will ceaſe, and the Horſe will be in a fair way of Recovery. For the <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> expels all Impurities out of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and conſolidates the part, which is all that can be deſir'd for the Cure of this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Piſſing of Blood</hi> be accompany'd with Heat and a Palpitation of the Flanks, as it uſually happens, give the Horſe a good <hi>cooling Clyſter</hi> every Evening, bleed him a a ſecond time, if need require, and diſſolve two Ounces of <hi>Sal Polycreſt</hi> in the three Pints of <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> which you were order'd to give him every day, and perſiſt in this Method till the Horſe recover.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sal Polycreſt</hi> make him forſake his Meat, give him once or twice an Ounce of common <hi>Treacle,</hi> or of that which is call'd <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> in his <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> and after he has recover'd his Appetite, return again to the <hi>Sal Polycreſt,</hi> but you muſt not exceed an Ounce or two at moſt. Since the <hi>Treacle</hi> call'd <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> is a very cheap Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and of ſingular uſe in the <hi>Colic, Want of Appetite,</hi> and other Diſtempers, I thought fit to ſubjoin the deſcription of it.</p>

                        <p>Boil ſix Pounds of <hi>Honey</hi> in three Quarts of Water gently, to the conſumption of a large third part, taking off the Scum as it riſes, then ſuffer it to Cool, and having reduc'd the other Ingredients to a very fine Powder, incorporate 'em by degrees in a Mortar with the <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Extract of Juniper.</hi> This <hi>Electuary</hi> has the virtue of <hi>Treacle,</hi> for it reſiſts Poyſon, conſumes ſuperfluous moiſture, reſtores Appetite, and cures the <hi>Colic.</hi> The Doſe is from one Ounce to two, in <hi>White-Wine</hi> or <hi>Claret.</hi>

                        <p>This <hi>Treacle</hi> is call'd <hi>Diateſſaron,</hi> becauſe it conſiſts of <hi>four</hi> ſeveral <hi>Powders,</hi> mix'd with <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Extract of Juniper,</hi> which make a very ſovereign Compoſition, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179659:265"/>an excellent Preſervative againſt Malignity. 'Tis better than the <hi>Treacle</hi> commonly us'd by Farriers, which coſts but a Crown a Pound, and has only the Name, without the Virtues of <hi>Treacle.</hi>

                           <hi>Another Remedy for</hi> Piſſing of Blood.</head>
                        <p>Take two Ounces of the beſt <hi>Treacle</hi> of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> or for want of that, the ſame quantity of <hi>Diateſſaron;</hi> common <hi>Honey,</hi> and fine <hi>Sugar,</hi> of each four Ounces: mix and incorporate 'em in a Mortar, then add <hi>Anni-ſeed, Coriander-ſeed,</hi> and <hi>Liquorice,</hi> of each two Ounces in fine powder. Mix 'em well, and diſſolve the whole in a Quart of <hi>Claret.</hi> Keep your Horſe bridl'd three hours before the Doſe and as long after, and let him blood the day following.</p>
                        <p>The day after his <hi>Bleeding</hi> give him this <hi>Clyſter:</hi> boil five Pints of <hi>Whey</hi> made of <hi>Cow</hi>'s <hi>Milk,</hi> with two Ounces of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in fine powder; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as it begins to riſe in great Bubbles, remove it from the fire, and adding four Ounces of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> inject it luke-warm. If the Diſeaſe continue, as I believe it will not, you muſt repeat the whole Courſe. I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes very happily cur'd with this laſt Remedy.</p>

                     <p>I Confeſs this is not a proper place to treat of this Diſtemper; and ſome critical Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will perhaps accuſe me of neglect of Method: but my Deſign is to conſider <hi>Things,</hi> and the Advantage of my Reader, rather than to confine my ſelf to a ſtrict Obſervance of ſuch <hi>Niceties,</hi> which are oftentimes mere <hi>Trifles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Accident no leſs troubleſome than the former, is the Drawing in of the <hi>Stones</hi> to the Belly, occaſion'd by the violent Contraction that proceeds from Extremity of Pain. Tho' the <hi>Stones</hi> hung ſwagging before, yet when they retire into the Belly they cauſe an intolerable Pain, which may kill the Horſe before the Application of Remedies: for if the Cure be not carry'd on with all Expedition, the Pain is redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd, and the Horſe lies down, ſtarts up, and toſſes his Body furiouſly.</p>
                     <p>This troubleſome Indiſpoſition is uſually occaſion'd by the Inflammation of the Neck of the <hi>Bladder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you perceive your Horſe to be troubl'd with this Symptom, and cannot feel his <hi>Stones,</hi> which are in a manner drown'd in his Belly, let him blood plentifully in the Flanks, and give him a <hi>ſoftening Clyſter.</hi> After which take a convenient quantity of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows,</hi> Powder of <hi>Lin-ſeed,</hi> and <hi>Violet Leaves,</hi> boil 'em well in <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> and add a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Lin-ſeed-Oil,</hi> then caſt your Horſe on a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill or in a Meadow, and anoint his <hi>Sheath</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> with the <hi>Oil,</hi> fomenting the ſame Parts with the warm Herbs: aſſoon as the <hi>Stones</hi> appear, take hold of 'em, and tye 'em about with a ſoft leathern Thong; after which make him riſe, and he will both <hi>ſtale</hi> and <hi>dung;</hi> for the Fomentation allays the Inflammation of the Neck of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and aſſwages the Pain of the <hi>Stones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis a certain Rule, That when the <hi>Stoppage of Urine</hi> proceeds from a confirm'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or Inflammation of the Neck of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and the <hi>Stones</hi> are drawn into the Belly, all <hi>Diuretics,</hi> or Medicines to provoke Urine, are to be avoided; inſtead of which you muſt have recourſe to <hi>Bleeding</hi> in the Flanks, and if the the Diſeaſe be very violent in the Neck, <hi>ſoftening Clyſters, fomenting</hi> of the Reins and Sheath. To conclude, if the Caſe were deſperate, and all thoſe Remedies had been try'd in vain, I would give the Horſe an Ounce and a half of the Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> call'd the <hi>Angelical Powder,</hi> made up into a Ball with Butter, in White-Wine, or ſome other convenient Vehicle; for 'tis a more effectual Medicine than any other that can be propos'd; you will find the Deſcription of it afterwards in this Book. Thoſe who wou'd have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179659:266"/>Account of this Subject, may conſult the <hi>Ninth Book</hi> of a Treatiſe printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> and entitl'd, <hi>La Gloria del Cavallo Opera del Illuſtre Signor Paſqual Caraciollo,</hi> where they will find all that can be ſaid of this, as well as of all other Diſtempers incident to Horſes, which are learnedly deſcrib'd in that Book.</p>
                     <p>I did not think fit to inſert the Deſcription of <hi>Pulvis diureticus Reginae,</hi> or the <hi>Queen's diuretic Powder,</hi> which is a meer confus'd <hi>Hodge-podge</hi> of <hi>Diuretic</hi> Ingredients, that are hardly to be procur'd, and at dear Rates. Any Book of Phyſic will furniſh you with long Catalogues of thoſe Drugs, but you muſt take care to chuſe ſuch as are moſt convenient. I could have ſwell'd my Book to a vaſt and uſeleſs Bulk, with ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, which are uſually Heaps of empty Words. And I have often found that thoſe who read Medicinal Treatiſes imagine they can cure all manner of Infirmities with ſuch highly extoll'd Remedies; but they are ſtrangely diſappointed when they come to make trial of their boaſted Virtues. Let us therefore learn Wiſdom at their Coſt, and beware of falling into the like Miſtakes. Moſt Authors borrow what they write from their Predeceſſors, and they only copy'd after thoſe that wrote before 'em, tho' perhaps not one of 'em ever experienc'd the Remedies they commend, but barely rely upon the Authority of one another. Theſe and ſuch-like Conſiderations, make me ſet a higher Value on one Experiment duly perform'd, than on all the fine Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and confident Aſſurances of Succeſs, that are to be found in many Phyſical Books. It muſt indeed be acknowledg'd, that there are ſome Authors who only write their own Experience, but their Number is inconſiderable, and 'tis a hard task for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reader to diſtinguiſh 'em from the Multitude.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LII. <hi>Of the</hi> Sixth <hi>Kind of</hi> Colic, <hi>call'd by ſome the</hi> Red Gripes.</head>
                     <p>FEW Horſes are attack'd by this Diſtemper, and few that are attack'd eſcape.</p>
                     <p>If you be not acquainted with the Conſtitution of your Horſe, you will hardly be able to diſtinguiſh this from the other Kinds of the <hi>Colic:</hi> And a Miſtake in this caſe is very dangerous, for all the Remedies already preſcrib'd for the <hi>Colic</hi> are hot, and therefore no more fit to cure this Diſtemper, which proceeds from a Heat caus'd by the Fermentation of the <hi>Bile,</hi> than <hi>Oil</hi> is to quench fire, ſince the Natural Heat would ſoon be overcome and ſtifl'd by that of thoſe Remedies.</p>
                     <p>But the Cure is ſtill more difficult than the Knowledge of this Diſeaſe, becauſe it conſiſts in a Fermentation of the <hi>Bile,</hi> which ſeldom or never yields to Medicines. Nevertheleſs, to proceed methodically, in the firſt place bleed your Horſe in the Neck, and an hour after in the Flanks; after which give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of the warm <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> or at leaſt of a young <hi>Sheep:</hi> in order to which, bring a <hi>Lamb,</hi> young <hi>Sheep,</hi> or <hi>Calf,</hi> into the Stable by the ſick Horſe, and having cut its Throat, receive its <hi>Blood</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Clyſter-Bag,</hi> which muſt be warm'd at the Fire, that the Blood may not be coll'd, and ſo loſe its Spirits. Aſſoon as all the Blood of the Animal is extracted, it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately injected (after you have <hi>rak'd</hi> the Horſe) without the leaſt Mixture, and hot as it comes out of the Veſſels. This <hi>Clyſter</hi> tempers the Sharpneſs of the Humour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the ſtreight Gut, and eaſes the Horſe wonderfully, who will not void it till the firſt time he dungs, in caſe he recover: for Nature makes uſe of it, and at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it with the Excrements in form of great <hi>Clots</hi> like <hi>Balls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of this <hi>Clyſter,</hi> which ought never to be omitted when it can be procur'd, you may uſe the Decoction of <hi>Purſlane, Lettuce, Succory,</hi> half a <hi>Cucumber</hi> (if the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon permit) and an Ounce and a half of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: let the Ingredients boil only half a quarter of an hour, and diſſolve in the Strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix Ounces of <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> to help Nature to ſeparate and diſcharge the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive that the Horſe is ſtill tormented, notwithſtanding the Uſe of thoſe Remedies, caſt him on his Back with his Legs up, and ſpread four Napkins moiſten'd in luke-warm Water, over all his Belly, without touching his Flanks. Hold him in this Poſſure for a quarter of an hour, during which time repeat the moiſtening of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179659:266"/>
                        <hi>Napkins</hi> twice; after which ſome Horſes are either cur'd or eas'd, whereas others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Benefit, but ſink under the Violence of the Diſtemper. If you are loth to give your ſelf the trouble of <hi>caſting</hi> the Horſe, you may obſerve the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper in Summer, order him to be bath'd, and keep him as long as you can with his Belly half under-water, letting him drink as much as he pleaſes. If you cannot conveniently bathe him, diſſolve four Ounces of <hi>Cryſtal-Mineral</hi> in a Pail-full of Water, and give it him to drink. But above all give him frequent <hi>Clyſters;</hi> for the <hi>Choler</hi> occaſions ſuch violent Diſorders in a little time, that the Horſe cannot hold out above ſix and thirty Hours at moſt. If he begins to deſire Food, 'tis a Sign that the Diſtemper abates, but you muſt not give him any.</p>
                     <p>I thought fit to propoſe theſe Remedies, though very few recover from this Diſeaſe, which almoſt always ſeizes on vigorous Horſes. If all your Endeavours prove unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you muſt lay the blame on the Violence of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>If all the above-mention'd Remedies produce no Effect, give the Horſe two <hi>ſtinking Pills</hi> in a Pint of Beer, and half an hour after a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> thus prepar'd. Boil an Ounce and a half of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in five Pints of <hi>Beer,</hi> or (if that cannot be had) of <hi>Whey,</hi> and after five or ſix Waums, remove it from the fire, and adding a quarter of a Pound of the <hi>Ointment</hi> call'd <hi>Populeum,</hi> inject it blood-warm. Half an hour after give him another Doſe of <hi>Pills,</hi> and continue after the ſame manner till he has taken three Doſes, and receiv'd as many <hi>Clyſters.</hi> If it be in the Power of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to recover the Horſe, theſe <hi>Pills</hi> will certainly anſwer your Expectation: but if the Horſe die after all, you muſt not imagine that the <hi>Pills</hi> kill'd him, but only blame the extreme Violence of the Diſtemper. Farriers call it the <hi>Red Gripes,</hi> which is the common Name they give to all Mortal Diſeaſes that are unknown to 'em It will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be objected, that 'tis contrary to the Rules of Art to give hot Remedies, as the <hi>ſtinking Pills,</hi> in a Diſeaſe of this Nature: but it muſt be conſider'd, that 'tis impoſſible to allay ſuch an Ebullition or Fermentation, by the uſual cooling Medicines, which are altogether uſeleſs in this Caſe. That Effect can only be expected from <hi>Alkali's,</hi> which reſiſt and deſtroy the <hi>acid</hi> Liquor that occaſions the Heat from whence the Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition proceeds. Now <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> contains a great deal of <hi>Alkali,</hi> and from the Union of that <hi>Salt</hi> with the <hi>Acid</hi> there reſults a ſort of friendly and <hi>balſamic Salt</hi> that acts jointly with the <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> which is very agreeable to the Nature of Horſes, and ſtrengthens it extremely. And even that Medicine alone fixes and thickens the <hi>Bile</hi> that ferments in the Inteſtines, and being rather cold than hot, tempers the Heat of the <hi>Bay-Berries:</hi> So that 'tis plain from what has been ſaid on this Occaſion, that the Mixture of theſe three Drugs, in a convenient Proportion, ſtrengthens the <hi>natural,</hi> and deſtroys the <hi>adventitious</hi> Heat that cauſes this Diſtemper.</p>

                     <p>HOrſes are ſubject to a certain Diſtemper call'd the <hi>Stavers</hi> or <hi>Staggers,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives 'em of the Uſe of their Senſes to ſuch a degree, that they are almoſt wholly ſtupefy'd: and beſides it makes 'em ſtagger, and beat their Head againſt the Walls.</p>
                     <p>It proceeds from hot, ſharp and thin Vapours, which riſing from the Entrails diſturb the Brain, and hinder its Functions more or leſs, according to the degree of their Sharpneſs, and the meaſure of their Quantity.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſtemper are hard Riding or Labour in hot Weather, noiſome Smells in the Stable, long Races, wheeling about or quick Turns too often repeated, exceſſive Eating; and above all, the Abundance of hot and ſharp Humours in the Stomach, which ferment and boil over, and leaving their natural place, deprave all the Concoctions.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe are obvious; for the Horſe reels and ſtaggers as if he were drunk, beats his Head againſt the Walls with extreme Violence, lies down and riſes, but with greater Fury than in the <hi>Colic,</hi> for you would think he had quite loſt his Sight,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179659:267"/>and he knocks his Head ſo violently againſt the Walls and Manger, that he is every moment in danger of killing himſelf.</p>
                     <p>To proceed to the Cure, bleed the Horſe in the Flanks, and in the plait-Veins of the Thighs, then give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of two Quarts of <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> luke-warm, with a quarter of a Pound of the Ointment <hi>Populeum,</hi> after which, ſuffer him to repoſe a while.</p>
                     <p>You muſt frequently repeat the uſe of <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and about an hour or two after the firſt is voided, give him that which follows: Boil two Ounces of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> in fine Powder, in five Pints of <hi>Beer:</hi> After five or ſix Waums remove it from the Fire, and adding a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Unguentum Roſatum,</hi> inject it luke-warm, and repeat the ſame frequently. In the mean time rub his Legs ſtrongly with a Wiſp of Straw moiſten'd in warm Water to make a Revulſion, feed him with <hi>Bran,</hi> or <hi>Wheat-Bread,</hi> and walk him from time to time in a temperate place. By a careful obſervance of theſe Directions you may cure this Diſtemper, if it be not accompani'd with a <hi>Fever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Diſeaſe ſtill continue, give the ſick Horſe an Ounce either of <hi>Treacle, Orvie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> or <hi>Diateſſaron,</hi> diſſolv'd in a Quart of the <hi>four Cordial Waters,</hi> that is, of <hi>Scorzonera, Bugloſs, Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Queen of the Meadows,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Cordial-Waters,</hi> and at the ſame time prepare this <hi>Clyſter.</hi> Take two Ounces of <hi>Sal Polycreſt,</hi> and a like quantity of the Medicine preſcrib'd for the <hi>Potion,</hi> that is, either <hi>Treacle, Orvietan,</hi> or <hi>Diateſſaron:</hi> Diſſolve 'em in two Quarts of a Decoction of the <hi>ſoftening Herbs,</hi> with a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Oil of Rue;</hi> make a <hi>Clyſter</hi> to be injected luke-warm, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after you adminiſter the <hi>Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Horſes are alſo troubl'd with another Diſtemper of the <hi>Head,</hi> which is not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the <hi>Stavers,</hi> and may be cur'd with once <hi>Bleeding.</hi> It proceeds from Fulneſs, and too great abundance of Blood, when the Horſe has been kept long in the Stable without Airing. Aſſoon as you take him out he falls down ſuddenly, and riſes up again ſo dizzy-headed, as if he were troubl'd with the <hi>Stavers.</hi> But you may eaſily perceive that 'tis a meer <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> for he is brisk and eats heartily while he remains in the Stable, and falls down only when he is taken out; whereas a Horſe that is troubl'd with the <hi>Stavers</hi> falls in the Stable as well as abroad; and his Eyes look wild, which is not obſerv'd when a Horſe is only dizzy.</p>
                     <p>This Diſorder is caus'd by the too great abundance of Fumes that riſe from the Blood, which throwing off Obedience to Nature, oppreſs the Horſe, and make him reel, and at laſt fall.</p>
                     <p>The Remedies for this Giddineſs are, firſt a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> then <hi>Bleeding,</hi> which muſt be repeated two days after: And to preſerve the Horſe from this Inconveniency, give him moderate Exerciſe, and leſs Food, that Nature may not produce more Blood than ſhe is able to govern.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LIV. <hi>Of a</hi> Shoulder-wrench, Shoulder-pight, <hi>and</hi> Shoulder-ſplait.</head>
                     <p>SInce theſe Accidents happen ſo frequently, it will not be improper to conſider all the Circumſtances that attend 'em; for many Horſes are Lam'd, and render'd wholly uſeleſs for want of a diſtinct Knowledge of the nature of the Grief, and a timely and methodical Cure. That you may comprehend the Infirmities mention'd in the Title, you muſt know, that the <hi>Shoulders</hi> of a Horſe, and other four-footed Cattle, are not faſten'd to the Body by large Bones, but only apply'd to the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Side, and held in their proper Situation by Ligaments which faſten 'em to that part. So that by a Slip, falſe Step, or undue Poſture of the Leg, a Horſe may be eaſily <hi>Shoulder-pight</hi> or <hi>Splaited,</hi> that is, ſome part of his Shoulder may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Body, which cannot be done without ſtretching the Ligaments. In all the moveable parts of the Body there are certain glewy Waters or Humours which facilitate the motion of the Joints: Now, theſe Waters ſlip out of their proper place where they are fix'd by Nature, in order to the more eaſie performance of their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179659:267"/>Functions, and are ſpread thro' the parts that are dilated or torn by the <hi>Wrench</hi> of the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> where they immediately grow thick and hard, and inſtead of facilitating the motion of the part, according to their primitive Inſtitution, hinder it, and cauſe that Pain which makes the Horſe Lame, more or leſs, according to the greatneſs of the <hi>Wrench.</hi> The Pain is occaſion'd both by the ſtretching of the Nerves, and by that ſlimy Matter encreas'd by the Humours which flow thither from the Neighbouring Parts. You muſt endeavour to attenuate theſe Humours, and afterwards expel 'em by inſenſible Tranſpiration, and by ſtrength'ning the part to reſtore it to its former Soundneſs.</p>
                     <p>'Tis hard to diſcover where the Lameneſs lies, if you did not ſee him get it, and if the Horſe does not caſt his Leg outwards, or make a Circle with it inſtead of advancing it ſtraight forward; for that is an almoſt infallible ſign that the Grief is in the <hi>Shoulder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Horſe be Lame, and yet be free of the above-mention'd Infirmity in his Gate, turn him ſhort on the Lame ſide, and obſerve carefully how he treads; for if the Grief be in his <hi>Shoulder,</hi> he will ſet his Foot on the Ground hardily, and endeavour to favour his Shoulder. If you cannot diſcover the part affected this way, take hold of his Fore-leg, and make him go backwards and forwards, that you may perceive how he moves his <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and whether he does not complain and ſhrink when you put him on theſe Motions. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that a ſlight Strain or Wrench, without a <hi>Shoulder-ſplait,</hi> will make a Horſe halt before; but ſuch a Lameneſs is not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                     <p>The uſual way to know whether the Grief be in the <hi>Shoulder</hi> or <hi>Foot,</hi> is to obſerve whether the Lameneſs be encreas'd or abated by exerciſe. For if it be in the <hi>Shoulder</hi> the Horſe will halt <hi>leaſt</hi> while he is heated with Riding; but if it be in the <hi>Foot</hi> he will halt <hi>moſt</hi> when he is ridden. When you perceive your Horſe to be Lame, in the firſt place you muſt unſhoe him, and order his Foot as ſhall be afterwards directed when we come to ſpeak of <hi>Pricks</hi> in the <hi>Foot.</hi> If you cannot diſcern any Hurt in his Foot, feel whether there is not a Swelling in the <hi>Paſterns,</hi> or whether the Lameneſs be not occaſion'd by <hi>Rat-Tails</hi> or <hi>Clefts;</hi> afterwards feel the <hi>Fetlock-joint,</hi> and all along the <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>back Sinew,</hi> to diſcover whether there is not a <hi>Sprain,</hi> and at laſt handle the <hi>Shoulder</hi> pretty roughly, to ſee whether the Horſe will complain of any Grief in that part.</p>
                     <p>A Lameneſs may be occaſion'd in the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> not only by a <hi>Shoulder-ſplait,</hi> but when the Horſe receives an external Hurt, by a Blow from another Horſe, by a Fall, or when his Shoulder is bruis'd by the Saddle: In all which caſes you muſt, in the beginning, order the <hi>Sorance,</hi> as if it were a proper <hi>Shoulder-ſplait.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other ways to know whether Horſes be <hi>Shoulder-ſplaited,</hi> but there are few or none of 'em who do not draw their Leg, or caſt it a little outwards: And the ſureſt way is to obſerve how they tread, when you turn 'em ſhort; for, with a little practice and attention, you may eaſily diſcover whether the Grief be in the <hi>Shoulder.</hi>

                        <p>When you perceive that the Grief is in the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> if the Weather be not Cold, and the Horſe halt but a little, lead him to a Pond or River, and make him Swim half a quarter of an hour in the Morning, and as long at Night.

Thus, by the rolling of a Stone under a Horſe's Foot, when he is Galloping, his <hi>Shoulder</hi> may be ſtrain'd, or a <hi>Shoulder-wrench</hi> may be occaſion'd by a falſe Step: In ſuch caſes, if the Hurt be ſmall, the Cure may be perform'd by bleeding him in the Neck, ſwimming him Morning and Evening, and rubbing his Shoulder with <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> at his coming out of the Water, as I intimated before.</p>
                        <p>If this Remedy prove ineffectual, bleed him in the Neck, receiving the Blood in a Veſſel, and ſtirring it with your Hand to prevent its curdling; then mix half a Pint of <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> with the <hi>Blood,</hi> and charge the Shoulder, rubbing it hard with your Hand, to make the <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> penetrate the Skin, which, with the aſtringent and ſtrength'ning quality of the <hi>Blood,</hi> does frequently perform the Cure without any other Remedy: But you muſt keep the Horſe ſhackl'd, if he walks awry, or deſcribes a crooked Line with his ſore Leg.</p>

                        <p>If the Lameneſs continue ſtill, you may conclude that the Hurt is greater than you imagin'd: But there is no Hurt ſo great either in the Shoulder or Hip that may not be cur'd with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> apply'd after the following manner.</p>
                        <p>The day after you let the Horſe Blood, and charg'd his Shoulder with <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> put a <hi>Patten-Shoe</hi> on the contrary Foot, if he does not lean on his Sore Foot, and fetter his two Fore-feet, if he walk ſloping from ſide to ſide; then chafe the <hi>Shoulder</hi> very hard firſt with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and then with <hi>black Soap,</hi> to make 'em pierce the Skin, rubbing in half a Pint of the former, and about half a Pound of the latter, and leave the Horſe in that-condition four and twenty Hours; after which, chafe him every day with <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> keeping him ſhackl'd and ſhod with the <hi>Patten-Shoe,</hi> about ten days, if need require, at the end of which, take off the <hi>Patten-Shoe,</hi> and trot him out gently, to ſee how the Cure goes on. If he Halt a little ſtill, continue to rub him every Morning with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> and at Night, without taking off the <hi>Ointment,</hi> or any part of it, chafe him with <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi> Continue thus till he Halt but a very little, or only yield or feign; and then make a <hi>Bath</hi> or <hi>Fomentation,</hi> of convenient <hi>Herbs</hi> with <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> bathing and chaſing the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with it every day. After the Lameneſs is quite gone, ſuffer him to remain in the Stable for a conſiderable time, without either Walking or Riding him all the while, for nothing but <hi>Reſt</hi> can make him perfectly Sound. And 'tis a general Rule, that <hi>Repoſe</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary in all Hurts of the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> that Nature may have leiſure to repair the Diſorders caus'd by the Strain.</p>

Take then, of the true <hi>Ointments of Roſes, Marſh-Mallows, Populeum,</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> of each one Pound, mix 'em cold, and keep 'em in a Pot cloſe cover'd. This is the true Deſcription of that famous Ointment ſo highly eſteem'd by Lovers of Horſes, for its manifold Virtues; for it ſtrengthens without Heat, and is proper in all caſes, when there is occaſion for <hi>Charges</hi> or <hi>Ointments.</hi>

                     <p>TAke of new <hi>Wax, Reſin, Pitch,</hi> and common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> of each one Pound, <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> two Pounds, <hi>Greaſe</hi> of <hi>Capons, Badgers, Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Mules,</hi> and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> of a <hi>Stag,</hi> of each five Ounces; <hi>Oils of Turpentine, Caſtor, Worms, Commomil, St. John's-Wort, Linſeed,</hi> and of <hi>Foxes,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Gabian,</hi> or if that cannot be had, <hi>Oil of Peter,</hi> two Ounces. Put the <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> in a Baſon over a clear Fire, with the <hi>Wax, Reſin,</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> beaten together, ſtir 'em over the Flame till they be diſſolv'd, then add the <hi>Fats</hi> and <hi>Stag's Marrow,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Turpentine,</hi> incorporating all together over a very gentle Fire; in the laſt place pour in the <hi>Oils,</hi> ſtirring the whole Mixture half a quarter of an Hour, after which remove it from the Fire, and continue to ſtir till it be cold.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Ointment</hi> is good for <hi>Shoulder-ſplaits, Sprains, Pricks, Hip-ſhot, Wrenches</hi> in the <hi>Hough</hi> or <hi>Thigh, Wringing, Surbating, bruiſed Legs, Sinews ſprung</hi> or <hi>ſprain'd,</hi> and for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Defluxions</hi> and <hi>Feebleneſs</hi> in any part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Before you apply it, you muſt heat the part by rubbing it with a wiſp of Straw, or with your Hand, then chafe it with the <hi>Ointment,</hi> as hot as the Horſe can bear it, holding a <hi>Fire-ſhovel</hi> red-hot near the part, to make the Ointment penetrate, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:179659:268"/>repeat the ſame Application once every two days till the Horſe be cur'd. If the Grief be in the <hi>Shoulder</hi> you may put <hi>Paſterns</hi> on his Legs, and a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the ſound Foot if need require. You muſt not be ſurpriz'd at the Swelling which will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Part, for after the Pain is remov'd, you may eaſily take away the Tumour with convenient <hi>Baths</hi> or <hi>Fomentations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may cure even <hi>Old Hurts</hi> by this Method: but ſince the <hi>Ointment</hi> is not always to be had, you may uſe the following Remedies.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place you muſt let the Horſe blood, and <hi>charge</hi> his <hi>Shoulder</hi> with <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> as before: The day following apply the <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> which you will find deſcrib'd <hi>Chap.</hi> 57. renewing it daily for three or four Days; and the Diſeaſe muſt be very ſtubborn, and deeply rooted if it yield not to this Remedy. You muſt not be ſurpriz'd if the <hi>Honey-Charge</hi> raiſe a Swelling, for that is a good Sign, and takes away the Pain: beſides the Tumour may be eaſily cur'd by convenient <hi>Fomentations,</hi> and even by bathing it with the Water that has been us'd to waſh Diſhes, if the Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be quite gone. But if this Remedy be not attended with Succeſs, wipe the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very clean, and rub it till it grow hot, then chafe it with the following Mixture; Take <hi>Oil of Spike</hi> an Ounce, <hi>Oils of Peter</hi> and <hi>Turpentine,</hi> of each two Ounces, <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> three Ounces; Mix 'em. After which put <hi>Paſterns</hi> on his Legs, and a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the contrary Foot.</p>
                     <p>If need require, two hours after you have rubb'd the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> you may apply a good <hi>Charge,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Red Honey-Charge;</hi> and two days after put a new Charge over the old, the main Deſign of theſe Applications being to concentrate the Virtue of the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> and promote their Operation. Four or five days after bathe the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with the <hi>Fomentation</hi> hereafter deſcrib'd, laying it above the <hi>Charges;</hi> then take off the <hi>Paſterns,</hi> and <hi>Patten-Shooe,</hi> and walk the Horſe gently, that you may perceive what Benefit he has receiv'd: for after the Application of the <hi>Eſſences</hi> the Pain for the moſt part ceaſes, and the Horſe halts no more. Nevertheleſs you muſt ſuffer him to reſt for ſome days; for tho' the Lameneſs be cur'd, the Part continues weak; and if you do not give Nature time to repair her Loſſes, the Lameneſs will return worſe than ever, and the Cure will be more difficult than at firſt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not imitate the old and pernicious Cuſtom of Farriers, in that which they call <hi>dry ſwimming,</hi> for it weakens a Part that is too feeble already, obſtructs the Cure, augments the Pain, and conſequently the Defluxion. 'Tis perform'd thus; they tye up the ſound Leg, ſo that it cannot touch the ground, and make the Horſe hop on three Legs, by which means, they pretend, the griev'd Leg is heated, and the Pores both of the Skin and Fleſh open'd, to facilitate the Penetration of the Remedies, which are endu'd with a Virtue to diſſipate and conſume part of the Slime, Phlegm, or thicken'd Humours, to aſſwage the Pain, and cure the Grief.</p>
                     <p>This Method may perhaps be allow'd, when the Hurt is old, and all other Remedies fail: tho' even in that Caſe you muſt not torment him by tying up only the ſound Leg, but rather put <hi>Paſterns</hi> on both the fore Legs: for the way that Farriers uſually take is the greateſt Abuſe in the World, and no Man of common Senſe will uſe it.</p>
                     <p>For a <hi>Shoulder-ſtrain</hi> you may bleed the Horſe in the Neck, and charge the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with <hi>Blood</hi> mix'd with <hi>Aqua-Vitae;</hi> two hours after chaſe the Part very hard with a Compoſition of equal Quantities of <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> and <hi>Eſſence of Turpentine</hi> well mix'd in a Glaſs, without taking away the Blood. Two hours after anoint the Part with half a Pound of <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> rubbing it in with your hand; next Morning chafe the <hi>Shoulder</hi> again with a quarter of a Pound of the <hi>Ointment,</hi> and at Night with half a Pint of good <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> continuing after the ſame manner for eight Days together; during which time the Horſe muſt not be ſuffer'd to lie down. Then take him out, and trot him, to ſee whether he halts; and if the Lameneſs be gone, let him reſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days, to ſtrengthen the Part.</p>
                     <p>But if at the end of the time preſcrib'd, you perceive that his Lameneſs ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, you muſt proceed to <hi>give the fire,</hi> thus. Find out the Joint or Part where the <hi>Shoulder</hi> moves, and make a Circle about it of the bigneſs of a Trencher; then pierce the Skin with a red-hot Iron, thro' the whole ſpace contain'd in the Round, leaving the diſtance of an Inch between the Holes: Clap a good Plaſter on the Part, and over that ſome of the ſtuffing that is uſually put into Saddles; put <hi>Paſterns</hi> on the Horſe's Legs, and a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the contrary Foot. When the Scab falls off, waſh the Part every day with <hi>Aqua-Vitae;</hi> and if the Lameneſs continue after the Sores
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179659:269"/>are heal'd, you muſt take Patience, and give the Fire time to operate, rubbing the burnt Part every day with <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> and walking him in your Hand. But if after all the Horſe continue ſtill to halt, you may e'en give him over for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LVI. <hi>Of a</hi> Shoulder-ſplait.</head>
                     <p>IF a Horſe be <hi>Shoulder-ſplated</hi> by a violent Strain, or be grown very lame of an old Hurt, you muſt at laſt proceed to <hi>Rowelling:</hi> but you ought to try all other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies before you have recourſe to ſo cruel an Operation.</p>
                     <p>Caſt the Horſe on a ſoft place, and hold him ſo that he cannot ſtir; then rub or beat the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with a Clod of Earth, Brick, or Currier's Pommel, till it be cruſh'd or bruis'd, moiſtening the Part with Water as you bruiſe it: After which cut open the Skin on the loweſt part of the Shoulder, about half a Foot wide of the part where the Shoulder is join'd to the Brisket, and three fingers breadth from the Joint, and make another Hole oppoſite to the Elbow, behind the Shoulder, overagainſt the Side, keeping free of the Joint or place where the Shoulder moves, to avoid drawing the Matter thither. In the next place, raiſe the Skin from the Fleſh with your <hi>Cronet</hi> or <hi>Iron Spatula,</hi> thruſting in the Inſtrument to its whole Length, at the Hole in the lower part of the Shoulder, and ſeparating the Skin as far as the Mane: then blow into the Holes, and put in two large Gooſe-quills anointed with <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> and fix 'em ſo that they may not fall out.</p>
                     <p>Three Days and three Nights after the Operation, take out the Quills to give a vent to the Matter, and beſmearing 'em with old <hi>Hogs-greaſe, Tallow,</hi> or <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> put 'em in again; after which you muſt take 'em out once every Day, for fifteen or twenty Days; and then taking 'em quite away, the Holes will cloſe up of themſelves. Some pretend that the <hi>Rowel</hi> muſt not be kept in above ten days, for fear of breeding <hi>Felan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and drawing ſuch a Flux of Humours upon the Part, that can never be ſtopp'd or diverted afterwards. But the bare Digeſtion of the Humours requires nine days, ſo that if the <hi>Rowel</hi> be taken away on the tenth day, what benefit can be expected from it. 'Tis plain then that we muſt give Nature time to evacuate the Impurities, and the thick Slime or Jelly, that obſtructs the Motion of the Leg. 'Tis true indeed nine days may ſuffice for a freſh Hurt, but after other Remedies have been try'd in vain, the <hi>Rowels</hi> muſt be kept in longer. And the breeding of <hi>Felanders</hi> and hard Lumps of Fleſh, may be eaſily and effectually prevented, by anointing the Quills, keeping the Holes open, and taking care to give a free Paſſage to the Matter.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve that the bruiſing or cruſhing of the Fleſh before Inciſion is only proper when the Shoulders are plump and full of fleſh, for when theſe Parts are lank and deſtitute of Fleſh, the Ligaments and Nerves lie almoſt bare under the Skin, and may be eaſily hurt and bruis'd by the outward Contuſion, and an Inflammation occaſion'd, which may prove fatal to the Horſe, as I have obſerv'd oftener than once. In ſuch a Caſe therefore the bruiſing of the <hi>Shoulder</hi> muſt be omitted, neither muſt the Horſe be caſt, if the Operation can be perform'd otherwiſe; but if he be ſurly, skittiſh, or very tender, you muſt caſt him, and take care to prevent his hurting you: then make an Inciſion in the midſt of the lower part of the Shoulder, ſeparate all the Skin of that Part from the Fleſh as far as the Mane, blow up the whole Shoulder, thruſt ſix or eight thin Slices of <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> of the breadth of two Inches, into the Hole, ſlipping 'em up between the Fleſh and the Skin to the Top of the Shoulder, then anoint the whole Shoulder, put <hi>Paſterns</hi> on the Horſe's Legs, and a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the ſound Foot. You muſt not be ſurpriz'd at the Swelling of the Shoulder, which will certainly happen; but continue every day to give a vent to the Matter, by taking out the old Slices of <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> and putting in new pieces, and always anoint the Shoulder, as before. After ten days are expir'd, put no more Pieces of Lard into the Hole, but only waſh the whole Shoulder with warm Wine and freſh Butter melted together. I uſe this Method at preſent with Succeſs, and it cures old Hurts without any danger.</p>

                     <p>To cure a <hi>Shoulder-Splait</hi> of a long ſtanding, inſtead of <hi>Quills</hi> ſome uſe <hi>Setons,</hi> which are made thus: Having made two Inciſions, one on the Top, and another in the Midſt of the lower part of the Shoulder, raiſe up all the Skin, and draw a Cord, made one half of <hi>Hair,</hi> and t' other of <hi>Canvas,</hi> thro' both Holes, anointing it with <hi>Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi> This Cord muſt be drawn downwards once in twenty four Hours, to let out the Matter; and a great quantity of Humours will be diſcharg'd in fifteen Days, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Skin be well ſeparated from the Fleſh thro' the whole breadth of the Shoulder.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Rowel</hi> or <hi>Seton</hi> occaſion an extraordinary Swelling, attended with an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Fever, anoint the Part with <hi>Ointment of Roſes,</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi>'s <hi>Ceratum,</hi> and inject <hi>Aqua-Vitae.</hi> When you think it convenient to cloſe up the <hi>Seton,</hi> draw out the Cord, and it will heal of it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>If this Remedy be duly prepar'd, the Powders beaten ſmall, and the Moiſture wholly evaporated, it may be kept a Year or two in a cover'd Veſſel and dry Place.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot procure <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> take two Ounces of <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> beat it in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with a like quantity of <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> till it be quench'd, and mix it with the Compoſition; but the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is a great deal better, and not ſo hurtful to the Nerves as <hi>Mercury:</hi> Or you may ſubſtitute two Ounces of <hi>red Precipitate</hi> inſtead of <hi>Cinnabar.</hi> If your deſign be to ripen a Swelling, add to the <hi>Charge</hi> either <hi>Pitch, Roſin, Turpentine, Pigeon's Dung, Fenugreek-ſeed,</hi> or <hi>Goat's Dung,</hi> chuſing that which ſhall ſeem moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and can be moſt eaſily procur'd.</p>
                     <p>During the Heat of Summer you may apply the <hi>Charge</hi> cold; but in Winter or cold Weather, you muſt heat part of it in a little Pot. If it be too thick, dilute it with <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> and if it ſeem too thin, bring it to a due Conſiſtence with <hi>Wheat-flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make it ſtick to ſloping and hanging Parts, as the Hips and Legs, you may add a little more <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Pitch,</hi> and apply it as hot as the Horſe can poſſibly endure it: but if you deſign to reſolve or repel a Swelling, the Addition of thoſe two Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients will procure a contrary Effect. Or you may tie it on as hard as you can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting the Part, ſo that you may thruſt your Finger under the Ligature or Bandage. When you have occaſion to put this <hi>Charge</hi> into a Horſe's Foot, you muſt apply it boiling hot. This Remedy is thick and glewy enough to ſtick for ſome time to a Part where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ty'd on; neither does it ſtick ſo faſt, but that it may be eaſily taken off when the Part is cur'd: beſides, 'tis free from the uſual Inconveniency of other Compoſitions of the ſame Nature, for it rarely makes the Hair fall off, unleſs it be apply'd too hot; and (which is beſt of all) 'tis a ſurer and more effectual Remedy than the other <hi>Charges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Ingredient of this Remedy is a ſort of <hi>Oil,</hi> which <hi>Tripe-ſellers</hi> draw from Bones by Boiling, and ſell for <hi>Twenty-pence,</hi> or <hi>Half a Crown</hi> the Pint, to poor People, who make uſe of it for <hi>Blows, Bruiſes,</hi> and <hi>Falls:</hi> Its Smell reſembles that of Greaſe; 'tis yellower and much better than <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> for it aſſwages Pain more powerfully, pierces deeper, and comforts the nervous Parts more effectually. If you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, uſe <hi>Lin-ſeed Oil</hi> rather than <hi>Oil-Olive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capon</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe,</hi> preſcrib'd in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, is better than <hi>Hog</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe;</hi> it eaſes Pain, and reſolves, and you muſt melt and ſtrain it thro' a Linnen Cloth. The ſame quantity of <hi>Badger</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe</hi> would produce an admirable Effect, or inſtead of that, <hi>Bear</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe,</hi> but the former is not ſo rare as the latter.</p>

                        <p>Take thick <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> three Quarts, <hi>Hog</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe</hi> a Pound; boil 'em together half an Hour, till they be incorporated: then add black <hi>Pitch</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> Pitch beaten, common <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> of each a Pound; ſtir 'em over the Fire till they be well mix'd: after which add fine <hi>Bole-Armenic,</hi> or <hi>Bole of Blois,</hi> eight Ounces; remove the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179659:270"/>Veſſel from the Fire, and continue ſtirring a quarter of an Hour longer. If the <hi>Charge</hi> be not thick enough, you may bring it to a due conſiſtence with a little <hi>Wheat-Flower:</hi> And if it be too thick, you may thin it with Wine, or Lees of Wine.</p>
                        <p>The Uſe and Application is the ſame with the <hi>Red-Charge,</hi> inſtead of which it may be us'd with leſs Coſt. The <hi>Ointment</hi> of <hi>Montpelier</hi> is alſo very effectual, and thoſe who intend to make a Campaign, ſhould never forget to carry ſome of it along with 'em.

                     <p>WHen a <hi>Shoulder-ſplait</hi> or <hi>Shoulder-pight</hi> is either wholly neglected, or unskilfully Cur'd, by the long continuance of the Pain and Lameneſs, the Shoulder, either wholly or partly grows dry, wither'd, juiceleſs, in a manner ſenceleſs, almoſt incapable of Motion, and like a dead Member in a living Body. For the natural Heat is deſtroy'd by a too ſharp and fiery <hi>Acid,</hi> which waſtes the part, and interrupts the courſe of the Animal Spirits; and unleſs that preter-natural Fire, caus'd by the <hi>Acid</hi> Juice be quench'd and extirpated by ſome potent <hi>Alkali,</hi> the Part will remain for ever uſeleſs, and depriv'd of all its Functions. The ſame Misfortune happens to Horſes, that by reaſon of a Hurt in their Foot, are not able to put that part to the Ground for a Month or two; for the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> if the Grief be in the Fore-foot, or the <hi>Hip,</hi> if it be in the Hind-foot, grows dry and ſapleſs, by reaſon of ſo long a want of Exerciſe to cheriſh the natural Heat. Theſe Infirmities are cur'd after the ſame manner as Shoulder-Wrenches.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem perhaps a vain and unreaſonable attempt to reſtore the natural Heat in any part of the Body, after 'tis ſtifl'd by an <hi>Acid</hi> Juice. But there is ſtill a competent degree of Heat left in the part, if it be aſſiſted, and the <hi>Acid</hi> Juice conſum'd by ſome powerful <hi>Alkali;</hi> for that being once perform'd, all that remains to be done is only to ſtrengthen the part, and help Nature to regain what ſhe had loſt. There are ſome Hints concerning this Remedy in <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> where he deſcribes the Virtues and Properties of the <hi>Sweet Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is partly contain'd in this Proceſs: But I claim a right to the Invention as it ſtands here, without owning my ſelf oblig'd for it to any Perſon whatſoever; and I'm conſident that upon a ſerious and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Examination, it will be found agreeable to ſound <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and very uſeful for Men.</p>

                        <head>
                           <hi>The Deſcription of the Ointment</hi> Oppodeldoc.</head>
                        <p>Take of the dry Roots of <hi>Marſh-Mallows, Comfrey, Gentian, long Birthwort,</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half; the <hi>Vulnerary Herbs,</hi> that is, <hi>Sanicle, Ladies Mantle, Mouſe-ear, Cat's-foot, Adder's-tongue,</hi> and <hi>Perwinkle,</hi> of each half a handful; Leaves of <hi>Roſemary, Sage,</hi> and <hi>Lavender,</hi> of each a handful and a half; Flowers of the laſt three Herbs (if they be in ſeaſon) of each a handful; <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> and Ounces; <hi>Cummin-ſeed,</hi> one Ounce; <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> in Powder, half an Ounce; <hi>Camphire,</hi> four Drams: Stamp the Roots, cut the green Herbs, and beat the <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> and dry Herbs groſly, throwing away the Stalks and Husks. Put 'em in a Glaſs <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> or the lower part of an <hi>Alembic,</hi> and pour upon 'em three Pints and a half of <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> then fit to it a cloſe Head without any opening ſuch as is us'd in the <hi>Circulation</hi> of Subſtances. You muſt try the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> thus; put ſome <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> in a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:179659:271"/>of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then kindle it, and if it be pure and perfectly freed from its <hi>Phlegm,</hi> it will ſet Fire to the Powder.</p>
                        <p>If you have not a <hi>Cucurbit</hi> with its <hi>Blind-Head,</hi> take a <hi>Matraſs</hi> with a long neck, and ſo large that all the above-mention'd Subſtances being put in, two thirds of it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main empty; then take another ſmall <hi>Matraſs,</hi> and turning its bottom upwards, put its Neck within that of the former. This is call'd a Veſſel of <hi>Rencounter,</hi> and is very proper for this Operation.</p>
                        <p>Lute the Junctures carefully, with two or three doubles of Paper, dawb'd over with Whites of Eggs, and ty'd about with Thread. After the Luting is dry, digeſt in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> ten Hours, the <hi>Matraſs</hi> being fix'd in the middle of the Kettle, with a lay of Straw under to keep it at the diſtance of two Inches from the bottom of the Kettle, During the firſt eight Hours, you muſt keep the Water about it ſo hot, that you can ſcarce hold your Finger in it; and for the two remaining Hours, augment the Heat, but not ſo much as to make the Water boil. In the mean time the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion</hi> will be perform'd, and the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> impregnated with the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Ingredients, in which their Virtue principally conſiſts, by the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Spirits rais'd by the Heat, which in their aſcent and deſcent extract the <hi>Tincture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is ſufficiently impregnated with the Tincture of the <hi>Roots, Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Powders,</hi> ſuffer it to Cool, and ſtraining it thro' a Linnen-Cloth, pour it again into the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> with a Pound of ſpeckl'd <hi>Caſtile-Soap,</hi> ſlic'd very ſmall. Fit the Veſſel of <hi>Rencounter</hi> to the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> lute the Junctures, and digeſt as before, till the <hi>Soap</hi> be ſo perfectly mixt with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that the whole is reduc'd to the form of an <hi>Ointment;</hi> then take out the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> and ſuffer it to cool: The <hi>Soap</hi> contains part of the above-mention'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> which will deſtroy and conſume the <hi>Acid</hi> Juice, or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (tho' real) Fire, that waſted the <hi>Shoulder.</hi> If the Doſes and other Directions be duly obſerv'd, the Remedy will be of the conſiſtence of an <hi>Ointment,</hi> neither too thick nor too thin; and to try whether it be well prepar'd, rub ſome of it on your Hand, which it will immediately penetrate, leaving only a <hi>greeniſh</hi> Stain, tho' the natural colour of the <hi>Ointment</hi> be <hi>brown.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When you intend to make uſe of it, chafe the part with a Wiſp of Straw till it grow hot, then apply the <hi>Ointment,</hi> rubbing it in with your Hand till it ſink into the Skin, and lay on freſh <hi>Ointment</hi> three or four times, rubbing it in every time, that a ſufficient quantity of it may enter. Apply the <hi>Ointment,</hi> after the ſame manner, once every day for ſeven or eight days; after which, for four days together, rub the whole Shoulder with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> pouring it on by degrees, till half a Pint of it be conſum'd at every Application, that if any part of the <hi>Ointment</hi> remain among the Hair, it may ſink into the Skin; neither muſt you leave off rubbing till the Half-Pint be conſum'd, tho' the chafing raiſe a ſort of Froth on the Shoulder. After the firſt Application of the <hi>Ointment</hi> you muſt bind two of your Horſe's Legs, putting a twiſted wiſp of Straw about each <hi>Paſtern,</hi> and tying 'em together with a Rope or Cord, about half a Foot long or more, according to your Horſe's ſize. They who have <hi>Shackles</hi> may uſe 'em if they pleaſe, or may make uſe of a <hi>Surcingle,</hi> but <hi>Straw</hi> is leſs apt to hurt the <hi>Paſterns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Ointment</hi> muſt be apply'd cold, for 'tis of ſo piercing a Nature, that you might make the whole quantity which I preſcrib'd ſink into the Skin at one Appplication; but you muſt only rub in a competent meaſure of it at each time, to help the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, to enliven the part, and draw thither the uſual ſupplies of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>'Tis an excellent Remedy to cure all Shoulder-Strains, Hurts, and Blows, even without uſing <hi>Charges, Rowels, Fomentations,</hi> or <hi>Setons,</hi> as I had occaſion to try in a very long Journey; for one of our Horſes being <hi>Shoulder-ſplaited,</hi> was ſpeedily cur'd by the application of this <hi>Ointment,</hi> tho' we did not ſuffer him to reſt, but only caus'd him to be led. If you have occaſion to apply it to a fleſhly part, as to a Shoulder before it be waſted, or if the Horſe be not cur'd in the above-mentioned time, you muſt repeat the whole courſe, or apply the <hi>Ointment</hi> one day, and rub in half a Pint of <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> the next day, continuing thus by turns for ſixteen or eighteen days without Intermiſſion.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeveral Perſons at <hi>Paris,</hi> of unqueſtion'd Credit, who can atteſt that both Coach and Saddle-Horſes, whoſe Shoulders were perfectly dry'd up after an ill manag'd Cure of Strains or other Hurts in the Shoulder, inſomuch that they halted downright, were abſolutely cur'd by the regular Application of this <hi>Ointment,</hi> and made fit for Service, without being troubl'd with theſe Infirmities ever afterwards.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179659:271"/>But 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Horſe muſt not be wrought or travell'd for a Month or two, according to the weakneſs of the part; after which time he muſt be led out or walk'd for a quarter of an Hour the firſt day, and afterwards longer by degrees, till the Part be fully reſtor'd to its wonted Vigour: For oftentimes incurable Relapſes have been occaſion'd by working or riding the Horſe too ſoon after his Cure. This <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> does not make the Hair fall off where 'tis apply'd; and 'tis alſo excellent for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd and tyr'd Legs and Feet. I can boldly recommend the uſe of it to all Lovers of Horſes, from my own ſucceſsful Experience; and I leave the Curious to judge <hi>whether</hi> or <hi>how</hi> it may be appli'd to Men.</p>
                        <p>'Tis an infallible Rule, that a Remedy which is of ſufficient force to perform great and difficult Cures, will eaſily conquer ſmaller Diſtempers: And therefore if the account I have given of this <hi>Ointment</hi> be true, as moſt certainly it is, I need not loſe time to perſwade you, that it will cure <hi>Shoulder-ſplaited</hi> and <hi>Hip-ſhot</hi> Horſes, and all other <hi>Strains, Wrenches,</hi> and <hi>Diſlocations</hi> in thoſe Parts.</p>
                        <p>Some Horſes, after they are cur'd of a Diſlocation or <hi>Shoulder-ſplait,</hi> aſſoon as they are ridden a League or two, begin to Halt, and grow well again after a little repoſe. Thus their Lameneſs returns as often as they are travell'd, and is cur'd by reſt: For the Ligaments of the Shoulder being weaken'd by the Strains or other Hurts, if they be not ſtrengthen'd and reſtor'd to their wonted vigour, the Horſe will at laſt remain downright Lame. Such caſes as theſe require a Remedy of ſo piercing a nature as to penetrate all the Fleſh that lies in its way, and carry its virtue entire to the Sinews, that faſten the Shoulder to the Body, and are the Inſtruments of its Motion, which are ſeven in number. And I'm fully perſwaded, by frequent and ſucceſsful Trials, that there cannot be a better Remedy propos'd than this <hi>Ointment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Hurt or Strain be ſmall, thoſe who have not this <hi>Ointment,</hi> may uſe that which follows; for 'tis ſooner prepar'd, but not ſo effectual.</p>
                        <p>Put a Pint of <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> into a <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> or ſtrong Glaſs-Vial, ſo that two thirds of it remain empty, add half a Pound of <hi>Caſtile-Soap</hi> ſlic'd ſmall, and ſtopping the Glaſs very cloſe, ſet it on hot Aſhes till the <hi>Soap</hi> be wholly melted: Let it be quite cold before you unſtop the <hi>Cucurbit</hi> or Bottle, and reſerve the <hi>Ointment</hi> to be us'd as the former. It will keep very long, for tho' it gathers a cruſt on the top, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains very good underneath.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LIX. <hi>Of Broken</hi> Legs <hi>or</hi> Bones.</head>
                     <p>WHen the <hi>Leg</hi> or <hi>Thigh-Bone</hi> of a Horſe is <hi>broken,</hi> he is immediately given over for deſperate; no Man being willing to undertake a Cure that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded to be impoſſible: And the reaſon that is alledg'd to confirm this vulgar Error, is that the Marrow of their Bones is Liquid. Nevertheleſs I ſaw a Horſe and a Mule cur'd by the ſame Method that is us'd for the cure of ſuch Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in Men. The Mule whoſe Thigh was broken was able to walk in three Months, and fit for Service in four. The Horſe had the Bone of his fore-leg broken, and the Fracture was accompany'd with a great Wound, which diſcharg'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Scales, yet he was perfectly cur'd: 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Callus</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the place of the Bone ſpoil'd the ſhape of his Leg, but it did not hinder him from performing his uſual Work, tho' he halted a little. It muſt be acknowledg'd, that the Situation of the Parts is extreamly inconvenient, and makes the Cure diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: But a Horſe can reſt on three Legs, without making uſe of that which is broken, as I obſerv'd in the above-mentioned Caſes, tho' they were both at Graſs in the Fields. Tho', in my Opinion, 'tis highly probable, that the Cure might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perform'd, if the Horſe were hung in a Stable. <hi>Philippo Scacco Datagliacozzo</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>Di Meſchalzia,</hi> makes the breaking of the Bone of a Horſe's Leg the ſubject of a whole Chapter, where he delivers the Method of Cure, which is alſo deſcrib'd by <hi>Signior Carlo Ruini</hi> in the Fifteenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Sixth <hi>Book:</hi> And 'tis plain they were both of Opinion, that thoſe Bones might be reunited and conſolidated. Nor do I ſee any reaſon why we ought not rather give credit to the Teſtimony of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Italian</hi> Authors, than to a multitude of Ignorant Farriers, who have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179659:272"/>to affirm, that the broken Bones of a Horſe can never be knit again. And beſides, I can, as an Eye-witneſs, demonſtrate the Falſhood of their Aſſertion, tho' the Inſtances I ſaw, afford very little Inſtruction; for he that perform'd the Cure was neither <hi>Smith</hi> nor <hi>Farrier.</hi> The Mule and Horſe were turn'd looſe, and left at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times near his Houſe, which was on the High-way; and he ventur'd to dreſs 'em with Splents and a Bandage, as he had ſeen Men dreſs'd on ſuch occaſions, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em looſe into a Meadow to take their Fortune: But he was forc'd every day to undo the Bandage on the Horſe's Leg to dreſs the Wound. I ſaw the Horſe ſeveral times hopping thro' the Meadow, and at laſt he was cur'd. The above-mentioned Perſon ſold the Mule at a dear rate, and came ſeveral times to my Houſe on the Horſe's back; for tho', by reaſon of the deformity of his Leg, and his halting a little, he could not find a Cuſtomer for him, he made him travel at a Foot-pace upon occaſion for above ſix Years.</p>

                           <hi>Oil of Earth-worms</hi> is thus prepar'd. Take a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Worms,</hi> waſh 'em, and leave 'em in clean Water, for the ſpace of ſix Hours, to vomit up and caſt forth all the Filth contain'd within 'em; then put 'em in an Earthen Pot with ſo much <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> as may riſe the breadth of two Fingers above 'em, the Pot remaining half empty. Cover the Pot and lute the Junctures with Clay, mixt with Hair or Saddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffings; then bury it in warm Horſe-Dung; and after it has ſtood there three days and three Nights, take it out, and as ſoon as 'tis cold, uncover it, taking care to avoid the noiſome Smell, and ſtrain out the <hi>Oil.</hi> When you have occaſion to uſe it, rub the Horſe's Legs till they grow hot, then chafe 'em, and eſpecially the Sinews, with <hi>Oil,</hi> and afterwards rub each Leg with a quarter of a Pint of <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> to make the <hi>Oil</hi> ſink in. This Application muſt be repeated daily for twelve days; but if the <hi>Oil</hi> do not operate ſufficiently, you may augment its Virtues by adding to each Pound of it, <hi>Oil of Caſtor, Foxes, Camomil,</hi> and <hi>Lillies,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half; <hi>Ointment of Marſh-mallows,</hi> and <hi>Populeum,</hi> of each two Ounces: Mix the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition over the Fire, and to make it ſtick the better, you may thicken it with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of <hi>Bees-Wax.</hi> After the Application of this Ointment, the Hair will fall off from the Leg, but it will grow again without leaving any Mark. 'Tis to be obſerved that the <hi>Oil of Earth-Worms</hi> alone, appli'd with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> does not make the Hair fall off.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of this <hi>Ointment</hi> is the ſame with that of the <hi>Oil;</hi> for you muſt chafe the Sinew till it grow hot, then apply the Ointment about the bigneſs of a Walnut to each Leg, and repeat the Application once every day, for twelve days.</p>

                     <p>If the Swelling be caus'd by a violent Blow with another Horſe's Foot, or by a Fall, Bruiſe, or any other ſuch like cauſe, apply one of the <hi>Honey-Charges</hi> deſcrib'd in the Fifty Seventh Chapter, and continue the uſe of the Remedy till the Cure be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.

                        <p>Tumors of a long ſtanding grow hard, becauſe the Humour contain'd between the Skin and Fleſh is ſo raw and undigeſted, that Nature is not able to concoct it: And therefore the Swelling muſt be aſſwag'd, and the harden'd Humor reſolv'd by the application of a piercing Remedy, ſuch as that which follows:</p>
                        <p>Endeavour to get ſome of the Horſe's own <hi>Urine,</hi> for ſo the Remedy will be more effectual; but if that cannot be had, take of <hi>Cow's-Urine</hi> a Pint, <hi>Flowers of Brimſtone</hi> half an Ounce, <hi>Allum</hi> a Dram; boil away to half a Pint, and bathe the Swelling with this Liquor, chaſing it hard: then take a Clout that has been worn, dip it in the ſame Liquor, and wrap it about the part, renewing the Application Morning and Evening, till the Cure be perfected. You may eaſily procure the <hi>Urine</hi> preſcrib'd for this Compoſition, by going into a Stall where <hi>Cows</hi> are lying, and rouſing 'em up: For they uſe always to <hi>Stale,</hi> aſſoon as they riſe, eſpecially in the Morning when their Meat is laid before 'em.</p>

It reſembles <hi>Ointment of Roſes;</hi> for tho' you may diſcover the <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> by the Smell, you will hardly be able to perceive it otherwiſe, as being ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſſolv'd. This Ointment is apply'd cold; 'tis a good Reſolvent, and both eaſes Pain, and aſſwages all ſorts of Swellings in any part of the Body, tho' they be accompany'd with Heat.</p>
                     <p>Swellings are frequently occaſion'd in the <hi>Withers, Hams,</hi> and other parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by Bruiſes, Blows, and other Cauſes; ſo that if the Inflammation be not remov'd, the Humours will flow to the Part, and make the Cure very difficult: but this Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment takes away the Inflammation, and diſſolves the Humours that are already lodg'd in the Part. And therefore aſſoon as the <hi>Withers</hi> are ſwell'd, and like to come to a Head, inſtead of applying aſtringent Remedies with <hi>Bole,</hi> which do more Harm than Good, rub the griev'd Part with this <hi>Ointment</hi> Morning and Evening, and cover it with a Lamb's Skin, the woolly ſide inwards. The continu'd Application of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy does oftentimes diſſolve ſuch Tumours without Suppuration; but if the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion encreaſe, you muſt open the Swelling in due time with a red-hot Iron, in one or more parts. And thus the Cure will be perform'd ſafely, ſurely, and pleaſantly.</p>

                        <p>Bleed your Horſe, and rub his Sheath, and the Swelling under his Belly, with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> every Morning and Evening; then walk him ſoftly half an hour, and after ſome time waſh off the Ointment with warm Wine and Butter. When the Part is dry apply the <hi>Ointment</hi> again, and above all, forget not to walk the Horſe half an Hour, or a whole Hour, and tho' the Swelling reach between his Legs even to his Brisket, fear not, for it will certainly be aſſwag'd.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, notwithſtanding of the Application of this Ointment, the Tumour will ſuppurate and come to Matter; and you may know whether it has a tendency that way, by its Softneſs, and by the laſting Impreſſion that it keeps when you preſs it with your Finger, as if it were Butter: in which Caſe you muſt open it in ſeveral places with a red-hot Bodkin, or ſharp-pointed Iron, to let out the <hi>red Water;</hi> then chafe the Part with the <hi>Ointment,</hi> and walk the Horſe.</p>
                        <p>If only the Sheath be ſwell'd, the Cure is not very difficult; for it may be quickly perform'd in Summer, by keeping the Horſe an Hour every Day in the Water, and in cold Weather, by anointing with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and then walking him.

                     <p>SOmetimes <hi>Sinew-Sprains</hi> or Sinew-Sprungs are ſo unskilfully handl'd, that tho' the Pain be ſo far remov'd, that the Lameneſs ceaſes, yet the Humours gather'd in the part not being diſſolv'd, there remains a Swelling, which grows ſo hard, that it ſeems impoſſible to cure it without Burning. Nevertheleſs on ſuch Occaſions I have ſeen the cure perform'd by the following Remedy. Take of <hi>Linſeed-Flower,</hi> and <hi>Bean-Flower,</hi> of each one<note n="*" place="margin">A Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above a Pint.</note> 
                        <hi>Litron,</hi> the ſtrongeſt <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> a Pint and an half; Mix and boil 'em over a little Fire to the Conſiſtence of <hi>Gruel,</hi> ſtirring all the while; then add a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> boil and ſtir till the whole be incorporated; after which remove it from the Fire, and mix it with half a Pound of <hi>Mule's Greaſe,</hi> or for want of that, <hi>Horſes-Greaſe,</hi> which you may eaſily do, for the <hi>Greaſe</hi> will be quickly diſſolv'd.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhaving off the Hair, chafe the Swelling very hard with cold <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and afterwards charge it with the above-mention'd Compoſition, covering it with Flax, and wrapping it about with a Piece of Linnen Cloth, which muſt be ſew'd, and will not hurt the Part ſo much as if 'twere ty'd; for the Sewing binds the Leg more equally, and with leſs Pain. Let the Dreſſing remain two days, then take it off, and bathe the Part with <hi>Spirit of Wine:</hi> after which repeat the Application every day, and in five or ſix times dreſſing the Swelling may be aſſwag'd, and the Cure perform'd with great Speed, and little Charge or Trouble.</p>

                           <hi>For</hi> Hard Swellings <hi>that cannot be cur'd by ordinary Remedies.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>It happens not unfrequently that <hi>Swellings</hi> in the <hi>Legs</hi> grow ſo inveterate and hard, that the uſual Remedies prove altogether ineffectual; in which Caſe you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> along the Swelling, beginning at the Top, and drawing the Lines or Stroaks down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at the diſtance of half a finger's breadth from each other, or croſs-ways if you pleaſe, taking care not to pierce the Skin, and above all to draw a Line on each ſide of the Leg, between the Sinew and the Bone, deſcending as far as the <hi>Paſtern.</hi> You need not be afraid of hurting the <hi>Sinew,</hi> ſince the Fire never does any harm unleſs the Stroaks pierce too deep, for if they be only made of a Cherry Colour there will be no occaſion for <hi>Plaiſters, Pitch,</hi> or <hi>Wax,</hi> but only to waſh the ſear'd Parts with <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> and <hi>Honey</hi> till the Scab fall off, and then to rub the Sores with <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> alone. If the Fleſh grow too faſt you may conſume it with <hi>Allom,</hi> or if that be not ſtrong enough, with Powder of <hi>Copperas;</hi> and thus by continuing in a careful Obſervance of theſe Directions you may quickly perfect the Cure.</p>
                        <p>If you have Occaſion to <hi>give the Fire</hi> croſs-wiſe round the hinder Legs, let the Lines meet on the midſt of the back-Sinew; but 'tis needleſs to draw the Stroaks over the Bone in the fore-part of the Leg.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Fire</hi> muſt be given in the <hi>Wane</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that its Operation requires the Space of thrice nine days, that is nine days for Augmentation, nine in a ſettl'd State, when 'tis at the Height, and as many more for Declination or Abatement, during all which time the Horſe muſt be ſuffer'd to reſt.</p>

                        <p>Boil ſix little ſucking <hi>Puppies</hi> in <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>Claret</hi> till their Fleſh be ſeparated from their Bones; then add <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows, white Mullein, Shepherd's-Purſe, Dwarf-Elder, Yarrow, Cammomil, Melilot, St. John's Wort, Sage, Roſemary, Thyme, Lavender, Hyſſop, French Tabacco</hi> and <hi>Marjoram.</hi> Some of theſe Herbs will ſuffice, for I only propos'd ſo many, that you might have the conveniency to chuſe ſuch as you can moſt eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.

                        <p>If after <hi>Foundering</hi> the Feet remain ſo ſore that on hard Ground the Horſe treads only on his Heels, you muſt join to this Remedy that which is deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLV.</p>

                        <p>As often as you unbind the Leg, chafe it with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and apply a new Lay of the Remedy over the old one: by which Method you may ſtrengthen Legs that are quite ſpoil'd, if the Horſe be young.</p>

                     <p>I Know not a better Remedy to ſtrengthen and ſupple a Horſe's Legs when they are ſpoil'd and grown ſtiff by Travelling, and the Sinews ſhrunk or harden'd, than this <hi>Oil,</hi> which requires a good Artiſt to prepare it.</p>
                     <p>Take an old <hi>Brick</hi> of a Pound Weight, or a little more, heated red-hot, throw it into a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> letting it remain there till it grow cold, then reduce it to Powder, and moiſtening it with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> diſtil the whole in a <hi>Retort</hi> with a Sand-heat. Reſerve the <hi>Oil</hi> that comes over, which is call'd <hi>Oil of Bricks,</hi> or of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take a Pound of the beſt <hi>ſpeckl'd Soap,</hi> ſcrap'd very ſmall, and thorowly mixt with a Pound of <hi>unſlack'd Lime</hi> in Powder. Diſtil in a <hi>Retort</hi> with a Sand-heat, and reſerve that which comes over in a Glaſs Bottle.</p>
                     <p>Take two Pounds of <hi>Earth-Worms</hi> well waſh'd, put 'em into Water to vomit up their filth. In the mean time boil two Pounds of <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> with ſix Ounces of <hi>Salt,</hi> till the <hi>Oil</hi> grow black, ſtirring the <hi>Salt</hi> perpetually, which will not diſſolve. Throw the <hi>Worms</hi> (firſt well wip'd and dry'd) into the boiling <hi>Oil,</hi> which will immediately ſcorch 'em; after 'tis half cold pour in a Quart of <hi>Claret</hi> luke-warm, and boil till the Wine evaporate. So you will have an excellent <hi>Oil of Worms,</hi> which you muſt ſtrain, and mixing it with the two former, diſtil all together in a <hi>Retort</hi> with a ſlow Fire, and there will come over a moſt excellent <hi>Oil</hi> to comfort and ſtrengthen the Sinews. A very ſmall quantity of it will ſerve for one application, for there is not ſo piercing a Medicine in the World, as you will quickly perceive by its ſtrong and ſtinging Smell. 'Tis extreamly uſeful for Horſes, and I know ſome Men that have receiv'd great benefit by it, in <hi>Sciatica</hi>'s, Pains of the <hi>Joints, Palſies</hi> affecting half the Body; and in the general, all Diſtempers, in which 'tis expedient to reſolve hard Lumps or ſtrengthen the Parts. This Preparation is difficult and troubleſome, but not chargeable; and the <hi>Oil</hi> may be apply'd to the ſame Uſes with that which Farriers call <hi>Eſſences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you have occaſion to uſe it, rub the <hi>Sinew</hi> of the Horſe's Leg, and the <hi>Paſtern Joint</hi> very hard, then anoint it ſlightly, and chafe again with your Hand, uſing only five or ſix drops of the <hi>Oil</hi> at a time. After the anointing, the part will ſwell, and the Sinew grow very hot, for the Humours muſt be rarefy'd before they can be diſſolv'd. But if the Swelling ſhould encreaſe too much by the continu'd uſe of the <hi>Oil,</hi> chafe the part with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> to take away the Heat, and then make uſe of the <hi>Bath</hi> deſcrib'd in the preceding Chapter, to compleat the Cure. If you be diſcourag'd by the difficulty of the Preparation, you may make the <hi>Oil</hi> thus.</p>

                        <p>Quench a red-hot <hi>Brick</hi> in <hi>Oil,</hi> reduce it to Powder, and mix it with the <hi>Soap</hi> and <hi>Lime,</hi> then take ſix-ſcore <hi>Earth-Worms,</hi> prepar'd as before. Diſtil all together in a <hi>Retort</hi> with a Sand-heat, and you will have an <hi>Oil</hi> which will produce the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as the former, but leſs effectually.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, if the above-mention'd Remedies have been try'd in vain, or if the Horſe be not fully reſtor'd to the uſe of his Legs, you muſt flie to your laſt Refuge, the <hi>Fire,</hi> and draw the Strokes or Lines either length-wiſe or croſs-wiſe along the whole Sinew; and in a Month or ſix Weeks the Legs will grow ſound and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd, and laſt long; for the <hi>Fire</hi> ſtrengthens the Sinew, and ſtops the flowing down of the Humours that ſpoil'd it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXVII. <hi>A</hi> Balſam <hi>for</hi> Legs <hi>ſpoil'd by</hi> Travelling.</head>
                     <p>TAke two Pounds of green <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> gather'd about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> beat 'em to a Paſte in a Marble or Stone Mortar, and incorporate 'em with two Pounds of <hi>freſh Butter:</hi> Take the Mixture out of the Mortar, boil it gently in a Skellet about an Hour, ſtrain it hard thro' a Cloth, and afterwards ſqueeze it in a Preſs, throwing away the groſs Subſtance. Then add to the ſtrain'd Butter one Pound of green <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> beaten to a Paſte, boil gently half an Hour, ſtrain and preſs forth as at firſt. Repeat the ſame a third time with half a Pound of green Berries beaten, boil and preſs forth as before, and you will have the true <hi>Balſam</hi> for the Sinews.</p>
                     <p>When you have occaſion to uſe it, rub the griev'd Leg with your dry Hand, till the Sinew grow very hot, then apply the <hi>Balſam</hi> to the quantity of a Walnut, and chafe it in with a quarter of a Pint of <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> on each Leg, pouring it on by degrees: Continue after the ſame manner for ten days, and then waſh the Legs very clean with <hi>Scowrings</hi> of Diſhes.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ſtiff and wither'd Legs will become nimble and ſupple; nor muſt you be ſurpriz'd if the firſt Applications cauſe a Swelling, which is the uſual effect of hot and piercing Remedies: For, provided the cauſe of the Diſtemper be remov'd, you may eaſily aſſwage the Swelling, with the Remedies preſcrib'd in the preceding Chapters; and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that almoſt all Legs that are ſpoil'd by Travelling, become ſwell'd at laſt.</p>
                     <p>I have heard ſeveral Perſons who live in the Country, complain that my Book was almoſt uſeleſs to 'em, becauſe they cannot procure the Drugs that are preſcrib'd in it; and I have been frequently importun'd by 'em, to find out a way to free 'em of that Inconvenience. But theſe Gentlemen would know every thing, without giving themſelves the trouble of Learning, and aſſoon as they hear the moſt common Drugs nam'd, they fancy a Man talks <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or ſome unintelligible Dialect. And therefore I can return no other Anſwer, than that I have always endeavour'd to preſcribe the moſt eaſie, familiar, and common Remedies, and that they may apply themſelves to any Druggiſt or Apothecary for a Solution of their Scruples, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Anſwer to their Queſtions. This is the beſt Method I can propoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Imaginary Difficulties, which will never trouble any Man that has a tolerable knowledge of Drugs. 'Twou'd certainly be a very pretty and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Invention to cure Diſeaſes without Remedies; but ſince none but Mad-men will attempt meer Impoſſibilities, and Medicines are abſolutely neceſſary to reſtore loſt Health, thoſe perpetual Complainers muſt e'en learn to underſtand 'em. Or if they be ſo much in love with their Eaſe that they dare not adventure on a little Study, they may let their ſick Horſes alone, and expect the Event: For the Diſtemper will end either one way or another, and they will have no other trouble than barely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide new Horſes to fill up their empty Stables. I do not think my ſelf oblig'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every impertinent Queſtion, but ſhall content my ſelf with aſſuring the Reader in the general, that if I had known any better or eaſier Remedies than thoſe I have preſcrib'd in this Book, I would have certainly imparted 'em to the Public.</p>
                     <p>You will find the deſcription of a <hi>burning Balſam</hi> in the Ninety Fifth Chapter, which will be of excellent uſe in this Caſe, if it be daily apply'd, after the Sinew is well heated by chafing; and beſides, it will neither cauſe a Swelling, nor make one Hair fall off.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXVIII. <hi>Of</hi> Malenders <hi>and</hi> Selenders.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Malenders</hi> appear on the bending of the <hi>Knee,</hi> being certain Chops or Chinks which diſcharge a red, ſharp, and biting Water. They are very painful, and make the Horſe halt, or at leaſt go ſtiff at his firſt going out of the Stable: You may eaſily know 'em by the ſtaring and briſtl'd Hairs that grow about 'em; and they are frequently accompany'd with a ſort of <hi>Scab,</hi> which is bigger or leſs, according to the various degrees of the Malady.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Selenders</hi> breed on the bending of the <hi>Hough;</hi> they proceed from the ſame Cauſes that breed the <hi>Malenders,</hi> and are known by the ſame ſigns; but they happen not ſo frequently, and are conſequently more dangerous, as denoting that there is a great quantity of Humours in the <hi>Hough,</hi> which continually diſcharge upon the Leg thoſe malignant Waters that at laſt rot and corrupt it.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not attempt a compleat Cure of either of theſe Sores, but only endeavour to allay the Humour, and qualifie its ſharpneſs by the uſe of <hi>Alkali</hi>'s, which blunt and deaden the too ſharp <hi>Acid,</hi> for they who abſolutely dry up the Sore, may be juſtly compar'd to thoſe who ſhut the door of the Sheep-coat to keep the Wolf in. And therefore you muſt content your ſelf with keeping the part very clean, that is, you muſt waſh and ſcour off the filth and corruption that ſticks on the Hair or Skin with <hi>Black-Soap,</hi> which is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and rub the <hi>Malenders</hi> with it; then waſh the part with <hi>Urine,</hi> or a good <hi>Lye,</hi> or rub the Chink with <hi>Butter</hi> fry'd till it grow black.</p>
                     <p>The ſureſt way to cure either <hi>Malenders</hi> or <hi>Selenders</hi> is to mix equal quantities of <hi>Linſeed-Oil,</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> ſtirring and ſhaking 'em till the mixture grow white, and to anoint the Sores with it once a day. This will dry a little, and allay the ſharpneſs of the Humours, ſo that the <hi>Malender</hi> will neither cauſe a Swelling nor Pain.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is an excellent Remedy for Coach-Horſes when they begin to be troubl'd with <hi>Red-Waters, Chinks,</hi> and <hi>Mules,</hi> accompany'd with Heat and Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Selenders</hi> cauſe a Swelling, which grows hard, and hinders the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hough, and ſince the ſituation of the Part is very inconvenient for the Application of Remedies, you muſt proceed to the <hi>give the Fire,</hi> as I once ſaw done with very good Succeſs to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, who was cur'd without the leaſt ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Ointment for the Feet,</hi> deſcrib'd in the Eighty Fifth Chapter is alſo very proper in this Caſe. <hi>Album Raſis</hi> dries a <hi>Malender</hi> when it grows too big, and aſſwages the Inflammation. The <hi>Ointment of Roſes</hi> is alſo an excellent allayer of Sharpneſs, if it be faithfully Prepar'd; for that which is commonly Sold, as I intimated before, is not made of Roſes, but conſiſts only of <hi>Hog's-greaſe,</hi> melted with a little White-Wax to give it a Body. Theſe Impoſtors ſtir it while 'tis hot, with a Root of <hi>Alkanet</hi> to dye it red, and waſh it afterwards in Roſe-Water to make it ſmell of Roſes. Meer <hi>Tallow</hi> is not at all inferiour to this pretended <hi>Ointment,</hi> with which ſo many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are cheated.</p>

                     <p>YOu will find a large Account of theſe <hi>Excreſcences</hi> in the Second Part; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with giving this ſhort Account of a <hi>Splent,</hi> that it is a <hi>Callous,</hi> hard, and inſenſible Swelling, which breeds on the <hi>Shank-Bone,</hi> and ſpoils the ſhape of the Leg, when it grows big.</p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:179659:277"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Splent</hi> is uſually occaſion'd by a Blow or other Hurt on the <hi>Shank-Bone,</hi> which offends the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> or Skin that ſurrounds the Bone; for the Humour gathering by degrees on that part, forms a Tumor or Excreſcency.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe may be alſo troubl'd with this Infirmity, if he be over-ridden or hard wrought when he is too Young, before his Legs be ſtrong enough, and his Bones of a ſufficient ſolidity and firmneſs to bear the Fatigues of Travelling. For by ſtraining of that part 'tis render'd ſubject to Defluxions (or the falling down of Molten Greaſe) and if the Humour ſlip between the Bone and its Membrane, it breeds a hard Lump, that by degrees encreaſes and draws its Nouriſhment from the Bone, which I have ſeen full of Holes like a Sieve in that part. To protect the weakeſt part of the Bone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Humour, Nature fences it with a <hi>Callus,</hi> which we call a <hi>Splent;</hi> and if the Excreſcency be augmented by Travelling, and aſcend to the Knee, it makes the Horſe Halt, and is more difficult to Cure than the other kind.</p>
                     <p>I adviſe thoſe who undertake the Cure of a <hi>Splent,</hi> never to conſume it with violent <hi>Cauſtics,</hi> which often ſcale the Bone, and dry up the Sinew. 'Tis true, theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines take away the <hi>Splent,</hi> but they weaken the Leg ſo extreamly, that it were better to let the Swelling remain.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be old, you will find the Cure very difficult, and the <hi>Splent</hi> can hardly be remov'd, whereas it may be eaſily taken away from a young Horſe; and in the general 'tis certain, that a large <hi>Splent</hi> may be ſooner remov'd, and with leſs trouble when the Horſe that bears it is <hi>young,</hi> than a ſmall Excreſcency in the Leg of an <hi>old</hi> Horſe.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall hardly meet with one that pretends to underſtand Horſes, who will not acquaint you that he is Maſter of an infallible Receipt for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and another for <hi>Splents;</hi> tho' upon trial you will find his performance come far ſhort of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Splent</hi> is an effect of the deprav'd Shape of the <hi>Shank-Bone,</hi> 'tis to be eſteem'd a <hi>Blemiſh</hi> or Deformity, rather than a <hi>Diſeaſe:</hi> For 'tis the ſame with that which Phyſicians call <hi>Apophyſis,</hi> and does not admit of a Cure.</p>

                           <hi>A Remedy for the</hi> Splent.</head>
                        <p>Shave away the Hair, and beat or rub the Swelling with the handle of a <hi>Shooing-Hammer</hi> till it be ſoften'd, then burn three or four <hi>Hazel-ſticks</hi> while the Sap is in 'em, and chafe the <hi>Splent</hi> with the Juice or Water that ſweats out of both ends, applying it as hot as you can without burning the Part; after which rub or bruiſe the Swelling with one of the Sticks, and continue frequently to throw the hot Juice upon the Part, but not ſo hot as to burn it, rubbing it ſtill till it grow ſoft. Then dip a Linnen-Cloth five or ſix times doubl'd in the <hi>Hazel-Juice,</hi> as hot as you can endure it upon your Hand, and tye it on the <hi>Splent,</hi> ſuffering it to remain four and twenty Hours. In the mean time keep your Horſe in the Stable, without permitting him to be led or rid to Water, during the ſpace of nine Days, at the end of which the <hi>Splent</hi> will be diſſolv'd, and the Hair will come again ſome time after. If the <hi>Hazel</hi> be not in its full Sap, it will not operate ſo effectually; nevertheleſs it may be us'd, but the part muſt be rub'd and bruis'd more ſtrongly.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Splent</hi> be not quite taken away, but only leſſen'd, repeat the operation a Month after.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Another Remedy.</head>
                        <p>Shave the Hair, knock, rub, and ſoften the <hi>Splent</hi> as before, then take a piece of the Skin of <hi>Bacon</hi> not very fat, and lay it on the part with the fat ſide outwards. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards apply a flat <hi>Cautery,</hi> or red-hot Iron of the bigneſs of a Shilling, holding it upon the Skin, and in the mean time order another Iron to be heated, which muſt be apply'd on another part of the Skin, but ſtill over the <hi>Splent.</hi> Continue after the ſame manner till the Swelling be diſſolv'd, then lay a Plaiſter over it, and ſhavings of Cloth over that, taking care that the Horſe do not bite it off.</p>

                           <hi>Another Remedy for the</hi> Splent.</head>
                        <p>The Remedies already preſcrib'd are eaſie, and almoſt infallible; yet I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear mentioning another, with which I cur'd three <hi>Splents</hi> in one Horſe; and one on the Knee of another, all in one Morning.</p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:179659:277"/>
                        <p>Soften the <hi>Splent</hi> according to the uſual Method; then wrap a red-hot Iron in a wet Cloth, ſtroke the Swelling with it two or three times, till all the Hair be come off, and the Part be as clean as your Hand, and afterwards prick it with a ſharp Nail, and rub it with white <hi>Salt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then prick a head of <hi>Garlic</hi> with a Bodkin, dip it in boiling <hi>Oil of Nuts,</hi> and apply it to the <hi>Splent,</hi> repeating the Application till the Tumor be ſoften'd.</p>
                        <p>Pill a raw Head of <hi>Garlic</hi> and apply it to the burnt Part, covering it with Flax, and binding a piece of Cloth over all. Keep it on Eight and forty Hours, then take off the Bandage, and ſix Days after you may lead your Horſe to Water, but you muſt not Travel him till the Sore be heal'd. Twice every Day, at his coming from the Water, bathe the part with <hi>Aqua-Vitae.</hi> This Remedy, as well as the laſt, leaves a Scar where the Hair will never come again, but 'tis ſo ſmall, that the Hair which grows about it will eaſily cover it.</p>
                        <p>I have often ſeen the Bone under the Swelling ſcal'd, not only by the application of violent <hi>Cauſtics</hi> or eating Medicines, but by <hi>giving the Fire</hi> too violently, out of an over-eager deſire to root out the <hi>Splent.</hi> This <hi>Exfoliation</hi> or ſcaling of the Bone laſts very long, and is dangerous; but you may uſe the above-mentioned Remedies ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for they never occaſion ſuch Diſorders.</p>

                        <p>Soften the <hi>Splent</hi> as before, and with a ſharp-pointed <hi>Fleam</hi> draw a Line about all the part you would have taken off, entring about half the depth of the Skin; then melt a convenient quantity of the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Apoſtolorum,</hi> add a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> and after 'tis half cold, but ſtill very pliable, make a Plaiſter of the bigneſs of the <hi>Splent,</hi> which muſt be kept twelve Hours on the Swelling; after which take it off, and wrap dry Flax about the Part, with a Bandage over it, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horſe from biting it off.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Scab</hi> will fall off like the Kernel of a Nut; and you muſt conſtantly bathe the Sore Morning and Evening with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> till it be heal'd.</p>

                           <hi>Another Remedy to take away a</hi> Splent.</head>
                        <p>There is a Plant call'd <hi>Briony,</hi> which has a very large Root, and ſends forth long Branches that ramp on the Hedges like the <hi>Citrul.</hi> After you have ſhav'd and ſoften'd the <hi>Splent,</hi> take a ſlice of <hi>White-Briony-Root,</hi> of the bigneſs of a <hi>Crown-Piece,</hi> boil it in Water a quarter of an Hour, wrap it in a fine Linnen-Cloth, and as hot as you can well endure it upon your Hand, apply it in the Cloth to the <hi>Splent</hi> about half a quarter of an Hour. The two ſucceeding days repeat the ſame Application with two freſh ſlices of the Root, taking care that they touch not the <hi>Splent,</hi> and that the Horſe do not bite 'em off. This Root ſuppurates the Red-waters, and makes a ſort of Scab or Eſcar fall off; but the Hair will grow again, and leave no mark of the Sore.</p>
                        <p>After the three firſt Days you muſt Air the Horſe every Day, and after twelve Days are expir'd, he will be fit for common Service. The efficacy of this Root de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon its <hi>Cauſtic</hi> Quality, which conſumes the <hi>Splent</hi> without hurting the Sinew.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Splent</hi> be upon the <hi>Knee,</hi> I know no better Remedy than the following <hi>Ointment of Worms;</hi> but if that fail, as it frequently does, the beſt and ſafeſt way is, inſtead of applying <hi>Cauſtics,</hi> which weaken the Leg extreamly, and may lame the Horſe irrecoverably, to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> and extirpate the <hi>Splent</hi> entirely, as in the caſe of the <hi>Spavin.</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>May,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>April,</hi> between Ten a Clock in the Morning, and Two in the Afternoon, you may find a certain <hi>Beetle</hi> or <hi>Black-Worm,</hi> in till'd Grounds, or Corn-fields, in low and ſhady Places. It has the reſemblance of a Head, at the end of its true Head, and a ſort of Wings which are faſten'd to its Body like two Targets, covering all the fore-part of the Shoulders, tho' it does not fly. Its Back is ſcaly, and its Tail very fat, and as it were welted. It has ſix Feet, and creeps very ſlowly. There are ſome of 'em very long, thick, and fat; and the ſmalleſt are about an Inch long: 'Tis cold to the touch, and if you place it on your Hand it commonly voids a very ſtinking Oil. Theſe Inſects are call'd in <hi>Latin, Maii aviculae,</hi> or <hi>Scarabaei unctuoſi;</hi> that is, <hi>May-Worms,</hi> or <hi>Oily-Beetles.</hi> Take three hundred of 'em, and ſtamp 'em with a Pound of <hi>Oil of Bay:</hi> Set the Ointment a part for three Months, then melt it, ſtrain thro' a Linnen-Cloth, throw away the groſs ſubſtance, and preſerve the reſt as a Sovereign <hi>Ointment</hi> for the Uſes that ſhall be afterwards declar'd.</p>

                        <p>This Ointment produces the effect of a <hi>Retoire</hi> or <hi>Ruptory-Plaiſter,</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Swelling: It draws out all the Corruption and Rottenneſs that is lodg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Skin and the Fleſh, and raiſes <hi>Bliſters</hi> full of <hi>Red-Water,</hi> which are ſucceeded by <hi>Scabs</hi> that dry up of themſelves, and the Sore is heal'd without a Scar, for all the Hair that falls off grows again.</p>
                        <p>When you have occaſion to uſe it, ſhave off the Hair very cloſe, and hold a hot Bar of Iron near the part while you apply the Ointment, which will exert its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſpace of nine Days.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be apply'd cold; and if the Swelling be a <hi>Splent,</hi> you muſt firſt ſoften it according to the uſual manner.</p>
                        <p>Tho' <hi>Wind-galls</hi> are not always attended with Pain, yet they are ſometimes both painful and dangerous, becauſe they may grow hard, and lame the Horſe, eſpecially if they be on the Sinew of the hinder Legs. I ſhall afterwards propoſe ſeveral Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for theſe <hi>Tumours,</hi> but they only make 'em diſappear for a time, whereas this Ointment takes 'em away ſo entirely, that they return not in a very long time: Firſt you muſt ſhave off the Hair, then anoint the <hi>Wind-gall,</hi> holding a hot Bar of Iron near the part; and the Swelling that will immediately appear in the Leg may be aſſwag'd by applying <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> in the ſpace of nine Days, during which time the <hi>Wind-gall</hi> will be wholly diſſipated. You may depend on this Method as that which I have ſeveral times try'd with Succeſs: For I relate things with all poſſible exactneſs and ſincerity, and ſhall never be guilty of cheating my Readers by over-ſtrain'd Commendations of any Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a Swelling remains after an old <hi>Sinew-ſprain,</hi> tho' the Horſe be freed from his Lameneſs: In which caſe, if the <hi>Tumour</hi> be not very hard, it will be reſolv'd and diſſipated by one, or, at moſt, two Applications of this <hi>Ointment,</hi> but you muſt not proceed to the ſecond, till you perceive what may be expected from the firſt.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve a Farcin-Knot you muſt ſhave off the Hair, and beſmear the part with this <hi>Ointment,</hi> which will draw forth Red-water, and afterwards a Scab. Repeat the Application, and the Swelling will be quite diſſipated, or the ſame effect may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by a <hi>Retoire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The following <hi>Ointment</hi> is not ſo <hi>Cauſtic</hi> as that of <hi>Beetles,</hi> but it operates ſufficiently on ſoften'd <hi>Splents.</hi>

                     <p>Some Meadows are almoſt wholly cover'd with a ſort of <hi>Bulbous Crow-foot,</hi> that has a Root not unlike to a <hi>Piſtol-Bullet.</hi> About the end of <hi>April,</hi> and in <hi>May,</hi> you may find under theſe Herbs, about the Foot of the Stalk, and never higher nor under Ground, a little black longiſh Inſect, not bigger than a ſmall <hi>Bean,</hi> without Wings, but furniſh'd with Legs, and ſo hard that you can hardly bruiſe it between your Fingers. Gather three or four hundred of 'em, and mix 'em with old <hi>Hog's-greaſe</hi> in a Pot; then cover the Pot very cloſe, till they are quite dead, and ſtamp 'em with the Greaſe to an <hi>Ointment,</hi> which will be more effectual the longer 'tis kept.</p>

                     <p>Then tye up the Horſe, ſo that he may not be able to reach it with his Teeth, and keep him thus nine Days, without taking him out to Water; during which time the <hi>Tumour</hi> will diſcharge a certain <hi>Red-Water.</hi> After the nine Days are expir'd, there will appear a certain Scurf or Scab which will afterwards fall off, and carry away the <hi>Splent,</hi> or leſſen it very conſiderably, without taking off one Hair, or in the leaſt hurting the Sinew.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXIII. <hi>Of</hi> Wind-Galls.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WInd-Galls</hi> are ſoft and yielding Tumours, of the bigneſs of a ſmall Nut, more or leſs, without Pain, caus'd by thin and ſerous Humours, and ſeated on either ſide of the <hi>Fetlock-Joint</hi> on the Skin between the Sinew and the Bone.</p>
                     <p>At the ſide of the <hi>Fetlock-Joint</hi> on the Inſide of the Leg, and ſometimes on the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, not far from the place where the <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> uſually appears, but lower and more towards the Side, there is oftentimes a little Bone that reſembles (tho' 'tis not really) a <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> and rarely occaſions Lameneſs, tho' I have ſeen ſome Horſes after long and hard Riding lam'd by it. The only Remedy in this Caſe is to <hi>give the fire,</hi> drawing Lines all over the part, and two fingers breadth about it, and afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a good <hi>Plaiſter:</hi> for the Fire diſſipates the Humours and Scurf that are join'd to the Bone, without which it rarely makes the Horſe halt.</p>
                     <p>Take Aſhes of <hi>Vine-Twigs</hi> two Parts, Aſhes of <hi>Tartar</hi> one Part, and make a <hi>Lye,</hi> with which (while 'tis hot) waſh the <hi>Fetlock-Joint;</hi> then apply the Aſhes, and bind 'em on. This Remedy will diſſolve the <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> and cure <hi>gourdy Legs:</hi> A <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> may be alſo diſſipated by waſhing it often with <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> or it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cur'd by applying the <hi>Ointment of Beetles,</hi> or the <hi>Retoire</hi> deſcrib'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter. Tho' this Swelling be not very dangerous, it makes the Horſe halt in froſty Weather, and is a certain Sign that either he has been over-ridden, or that his <hi>Paſterns</hi> are too long, or his Legs too ſlender and feeble to ſupport the over-proportion'd Weight of a bulky and fleſhy Body.</p>
                     <p>Reſt cures <hi>Wind-Galls</hi> in the Beginning.</p>
                     <p>Or make the Horſe once every day ſtand up to the Knees in Water, in the midſt of a Stream, and aſſoon as he comes into the Stable apply a <hi>Reſtringent Charge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Crum</hi> of a little <hi>Loaf</hi> hot from the Oven, ſoak it in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it warm to the <hi>Wind-Gall:</hi> lay a Bolſter over it, and tye it on with a broad Band wrapt ſeveral times about the Leg. This will cure a <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> in four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hours.</p>
                     <p>I remember that having apply'd this Remedy to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, who was troubl'd with a ſmall <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> when I remov'd the Dreſſing I found the Leg very much ſwoll'n, which ſurpriz'd me ſo much the more, becauſe I cou'd not imagine whence the Swelling proceeded. In ſo doubtful a Caſe I apply'd the Remedy deſcrib'd in the Sixty firſt Chapter, conſiſting of <hi>Allom, Whites of Eggs, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which aſſwag'd the Swelling in three or four times Dreſſing; but the <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſtill, nor did I judge it convenient to endeavour the Removal of it by a new Application, ſince my firſt Attempt had ſucceeded ſo ill; tho' both before and ſince that time I have often cur'd <hi>Wind-Galls</hi> without the leaſt appearance of a Swelling in the Leg. This Accident convinc'd me that the ſureſt Remedy may fail ſometimes, and that we ought ſtill to be prepar'd for all Events, and when one Remedy proves unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful to have recourſe to another. The following <hi>Reſtringent</hi> is very good.</p>
                     <p>Take Powder of <hi>Red Roſes</hi> and of <hi>Myrtle-Berries,</hi> of each two Drams; fine <hi>Bole</hi> in powder, and <hi>Starch,</hi> of each four Ounces; Juice of <hi>Plantane</hi> and green <hi>Service-Berries,</hi> or (for want of theſe) <hi>Medlars,</hi> of each an Ounce, <hi>Vinegar of Roſes</hi> three Ounces: Mix 'em cold, and make a <hi>Reſtringent Charge.</hi> If it be too thin you may thicken it with <hi>Chalk,</hi> and if it be too thick, dilute it with <hi>Vinegar of Roſes.</hi>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:179659:279"/>
                     <p>This Remedy ſerves not only to diſſipate <hi>Wind-Galls,</hi> which uſually return upon the firſt occaſion of violent Exerciſe, but alſo to ſtop Defluxions, and aſſwage or repel Swellings where it wou'd be dangerous to ſuffer 'em to end in <hi>Impoſthumes,</hi> as in all <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy</hi> Parts, on the <hi>Hough</hi> and <hi>Reins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you would abſolutely extirpate a <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> apply ſome <hi>ſoftening</hi> Remedy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the <hi>Ointment of Beetles,</hi> or that of <hi>Worms.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> make uſe of <hi>Retoirs</hi> with excellent Succeſs, and the ſame are now very much us'd at <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Tis true thoſe Medicines occaſion a Swelling in the Part to which they are apply'd, but that is ſoon aſſwag'd without any ill Conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Yet before you apply a <hi>Retoire,</hi> you may try the following Remedy.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>To repel or aſſwage a</hi> Wind-Gall, Wen, <hi>or any other</hi> Soft Swelling.</head>
                        <p>Take a Quart of ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and four Ounces of <hi>Galbanum</hi> beaten; digeſt 'em on hot Aſhes four and twenty Hours, ſtirring 'em from time to time till the <hi>Galbanum</hi> be wholly diſſolv'd; then put in a Pound of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and boil over a ſlow fire half an Hour, after which add <hi>Maſtich</hi> in powder three Ounces, fine <hi>Bole</hi> one Pound; Mix and make a <hi>Charge,</hi> which muſt be apply'd hot, and cover'd with a Piece of Paper. When this falls off you will find the Swelling gone, and therefore you may waſh the Part with <hi>black Soap, Butter,</hi> or <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> for one Application is almoſt always ſufficient. This is an excellent Remedy.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Charge</hi> will aſſwage and repel <hi>Wens</hi> in the Beginning, and take away all ſorts of Swellings.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">

                           <hi>To take away a</hi> Wind-Gall.</head>
                        <p>I can aſſure the Reader, from frequent and ſucceſsful Experience, that the <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Beetles,</hi> deſcrib'd in the <hi>ſeventieth Chapter,</hi> or a convenient <hi>Retoire</hi> will utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate a <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> and the Hair will grow again as before. Thus the Cure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd more ſurely and effectually than by <hi>repelling</hi> Medicines; for the Cauſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and the Humours that fomented the <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> evacuated, whereas the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Remedy only drives in the Swelling, but does not diſſolve it.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not be ſurpriz'd at the Swelling occaſion'd by the <hi>Ointment of Beetles;</hi> for it ought to produce that Effect, and the Tumour will fall away by degrees. And even ſometimes when too large a quantity of the <hi>Ointment</hi> is apply'd the Leg ſwells ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, that the Horſe ſeems to be irrecoverably loſt; but you may eaſily aſſwage the Swelling, and take away the Heat and Pain, by waſhing the Part with warm <hi>Wine</hi> mix'd with a little <hi>Butter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fire</hi> is the laſt and beſt Remedy for <hi>Wind-Galls,</hi> for it reſolves and diſſipates 'em ſo entirely that they never return again. 'Tis true it ſpoils the Sale of the Horſe, but it makes him fit for Service: and I may ſay truly and without Vanity, that I have brought this Remedy into faſhion at <hi>Paris,</hi> and made it ſo common as 'tis at preſent; and even I have often ſeen the <hi>King</hi> at Hunting on the Back of a Horſe that had been <hi>fir'd</hi> on all his <hi>four Legs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>ſinewy Wind-Galls</hi> that grow on the <hi>Sinew</hi> behind the <hi>Fetlock,</hi> the ſureſt Remedy is to <hi>give the Fire</hi> pretty ſmartly, but without piercing the Skin, which will certainly cure 'em in the Beginning: but this Operation is oftentimes delay'd till the <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> grows big, and ſo hard that you cannot preſs it down with your Finger, ſo that many Horſes are irrecoverably loſt by meer Neglect: for they halt right-down, and tho' you <hi>give the Fire</hi> it will not produce the deſir'd Effect in leſs than ſix or eight Months; and even then the Cure is frequently imperfect, becauſe the Tumour is grown ſo hard that the <hi>Fire</hi> either operates very ſlowly, or not at all. And therefore aſſoon as a <hi>ſinewy Wind-Gall</hi> begins to make your Horſe halt, you muſt immediately <hi>give the Fire,</hi> before the Swelling grow big and hard; I ſpeak only of the <hi>hinder Legs,</hi> which are frequently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Accidents of this Nature, whereas the <hi>fore Legs</hi> are rarely troubl'd with 'em.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXIV. <hi>Of</hi> Retories <hi>or</hi> Ruptories, <hi>call'd, by the</hi> Italians, Dead Fire.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Italian</hi> Name of theſe Medicines is grounded on Reaſon, for they not only heat the Part to which they are apply'd, but even deſtroy it, if they be raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immoderately us'd: and therefore a <hi>Retoire</hi> is a kind of <hi>potential Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ruptories</hi> are compos'd in the Form of an <hi>Ointment</hi> of almoſt the ſame Drugs that are us'd in <hi>Bliſtering-Plaiſters</hi> for <hi>Men,</hi> which derive their Name from the Bladders or <hi>Bliſters</hi> full of a reddiſh Water that ariſe in the Parts to which theſe Plaiſters are apply'd. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toires</hi> produce the ſame Effect in <hi>Horſes,</hi> for they draw forth red Waters from the Part on which they are laid. Theſe are excellent Remedies in the hands of a prudent and skilful Perſon; but if they be raſhly apply'd either in too large a Quantity, or on ſome great Veins, as in the Caſe of a <hi>Blood-Spavin,</hi> they will occaſion no leſs dangerous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, than if a <hi>Cautery</hi> or <hi>Cauſtic</hi> had been apply'd; for beſides the Inflammation and Pain with which they are conſtantly attended, they raiſe prodigious Scabs and Scurfs, and make 'em fall away from the Part: 'tis plain then that a <hi>Retoire</hi> muſt be us'd with a great deal of Care and Circumſpection.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Retoire</hi> is of excellent Uſe to aſſwage and diſſolve any Swelling, for the <hi>Red Water</hi> which it draws forth, being evacuated, the Tumour muſt needs be leſſen'd. The Application may be ſafely repeated; and even when 'tis not of ſufficient Force to take away the Swelling, it ſerves as a Preparative for the <hi>Fire,</hi> which utterly extirpates the Tumour. Thus if your Horſe be troubl'd with a large <hi>Wen,</hi> you muſt firſt apply a <hi>Ruptory,</hi> to draw forth the moſt ſerous Humours, and to rarifie thoſe that are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely thick, and turn 'em to a <hi>reddiſh Water</hi> by its Heat, and after a ſecond Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Retoire</hi> has produc'd all the Effects that can be expected from a Medicine of that Nature, you muſt proceed to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> which will powerfully aſſwage the Tumour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Retoire</hi> ſerves alſo to ripen a <hi>Kernel</hi> under the <hi>Chaul,</hi> or to diſſolve it when it does not tend to Suppuration: and beſides 'tis very proper to ripen <hi>Anticors,</hi> and Swellings in the <hi>Withers,</hi> to remove <hi>Sit-faſts,</hi> and to extirpate <hi>Wind-Galls;</hi> and the <hi>Ointment of Beetles</hi> is properly a <hi>Retoire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Application is thus perform'd. After you have rubb'd the Part, anoint it with the <hi>Retoire,</hi> laying it on very thin, leſt it ſhou'd run down, and holding a hot Bar of Iron near the Part, to make the <hi>Retoire</hi> ſink into it. This muſt be done two days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Swelling that is occaſion'd in the Part, will vaniſh of it ſelf when the Remedy has produc'd its Effect. You muſt only apply it once to a <hi>Wind-Gall,</hi> which is too near the <hi>Sinews</hi> to bear two ſucceſſive Applications: but if you intend to diſſolve a very hard <hi>Farcy-Knot,</hi> you muſt rub it with the <hi>Retoire</hi> two or three days together, that the Water may be ſufficiently drawn forth. Thus you muſt uſe this Remedy with Judgment, according to the Nature of the Part, and the Hardneſs and Largeneſs of the Swelling.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall afterwards have occaſion to add ſome Obſervations concerning the Effects of this Remedy, in treating of the Diſeaſes which it cures: and therefore I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with ſubjoining the Deſcriptions of two or three good <hi>Ruptories.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179659:280"/>that he may not be able to reach the Swelling with his Teeth for nine days.

                     <p>The Joint is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrain'd</hi> or <hi>Luxated,</hi> when it ſlips aſide with Violence, and tho' it does not go out of its Place, the Sinews and Ligaments that faſten it to the <hi>Paſtern</hi> are ſtretch'd. 'Tis occaſion'd by a Slip or falſe Step in uneven and rough ground; and if it be neglected, the Humours falling into the part grow hard, and by corrupting the Sinews, at laſt make the Horſe down-right lame.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome <hi>Strains</hi> which ſeem at firſt to be very violent, tho' they only make the Horſe halt for five or ſix ſteps, and may be cur'd by Reſt alone, without applying any Remedy: but there are others which make the Horſe irrecoverably lame all the reſt of his Life. And beſides it happens not unfrequently, that during the Cure of the ſtrain'd Joint, the contrary Foot is quite ſpoil'd and lam'd by being forc'd to ſuſtain the Weight of the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen ſome Horſes <hi>founder'd</hi> that were kept in the Stable, by reaſon of a <hi>Strain;</hi> and the <hi>Foundering</hi> not being perceiv'd in time, fell into their Feet, and made 'em incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably lame, tho' the <hi>Strains</hi> were in a hopeful Condition.

                        <p>Aſſoon as a Misfortune of this Nature happens, you muſt immediately alight, and lead your Horſe to a Place where he may reſt, without ſuffering the Part to cool; for a due Obſervance of this Caution (if poſſible) will very conſiderably haſten the Cure. Then diſſolve <hi>white Vitriol</hi> to the quantity of an Egg, in a Quart of cold Water, and wrap the Joint about with a Linnen Cloth four times doubl'd dipt in the Water, tying another Cloth above it. Repeat the Application every ſix Hours, and the Cure will be perfected in two days at moſt, if the Remedy be apply'd before the Joint cool; but if the Application of the Remedy be delay'd too long, or if the <hi>Strain</hi> happen in one of the hinder Joints, the Cure will require a longer time.

                        <p>Boil a Pound of <hi>Tar</hi> in a Pint of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> over a clear Fire, for a quarter of an Hour, ſtirring it often; then add two Ounces of <hi>Oriental Bole</hi> in Powder, thicken it with Flower, and apply it hot to the Joint with Flax, binding it on, and renewing it every two Days. Thus you may cure the moſt deſperate <hi>Strain,</hi> by two or three Applications, but you muſt begin the Cure with the <hi>Eſſence.</hi> This is an eaſie and moſt effectual Remedy, only it diſcolours the Hair, and ſtains it with white or grey Spots, which laſt for ſome time, but black Horſes are not ſubject to that Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. 'Tis alſo endu'd with an admirable Vertue to cure Blows and Swellings in the <hi>Knees</hi> or <hi>Houghs,</hi> without the uſe of <hi>Eſſences:</hi> It exceeds moſt other Remedies both in Efficacy and Cheapneſs, which are the two principal Qualifications that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a Medicine to the generality of Mankind. If the <hi>Strain</hi> in the <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> be accompany'd with a conſiderable Heat, you may apply the <hi>Remolade</hi> without the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> for it frequently perfects the Cure after ſeveral Applications.</p>
                        <p>Or take the Roots of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Comfrey,</hi> boil 'em in <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> till they begin to grow ſoft, then add the following Herbs, or ſuch of 'em as you can readily procure, namely, <hi>White-Mullein, Sage, Hyſop, Roſemary, Thyme, Lavender, Wormwood, Ground-pine, tops</hi> of <hi>Dill, Bay-berries,</hi> and <hi>Juniper-berries</hi> beaten; boil again about two Hours, pouring in freſh <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> inſtead of that which is waſted by boiling; and juſt before you remove the Veſſel from the Fire, add Flowers of <hi>Cammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil</hi> and <hi>Melilote.</hi> Then take out the Ingredients, and throwing away all the Stalks, beat 'em to a Maſh, and to make the Medicine more fine, ſtrain the whole thro' a Hair-Sieve with the bottom turn'd upwards; but that Nicety is not abſolutely neceſſary. Mix the Maſh with the <hi>Lees</hi> in which it was boil'd, with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Badger's</hi> and <hi>Mule's-greaſe,</hi> and boil till the <hi>Lees,</hi> and almoſt all the Moiſture be conſum'd. Then chafe the Joint with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and apply this Compoſition round about it with Flax, and a Bandage over all; rubbing the part with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and renewing the Application without taking away the firſt, till the Cure be perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd.</p>
                        <p>When you perceive that the uſual Remedies are wholly ineffectual, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the chief Operator, has not perform'd its part, being unable to reſolve and diſſipate the Humours that are already grown thick and hard, and occaſion Lameneſs and Pain; for the laſt Remedy you muſt <hi>give the Fire,</hi> drawing Lines with a hot Iron about the Joint, without piercing the Skin, and covering it with a good Plaiſter. After the Scabs are fall'n off, chafe the Sores with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and ſtrew 'em with Powder of <hi>Oyſter-ſhells,</hi> perſiſting in the ſame Method till the Cure be compleated. For the <hi>Fire</hi> being a powerful <hi>Reſolver</hi> will aſſwage the Swelling, ſtrengthen the Sinews and Ligaments, and make the Horſe ſound, if it be in the power of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to reſtore him.</p>
                        <p>It happens not unfrequently, that a real <hi>Diſlocation</hi> of the Bone is miſtaken for a ſimple <hi>Strain;</hi> but you may eaſily avoid falling into that Error, by obſerving the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Horſe's Foot. If the Bone be out of its place, and the Pain ſo violent that the Horſe cannot reſt on his griev'd Leg, you muſt graſp the Joint with one Hand, and with the other move the Foot, that you may perceive whether the Bone be diſlocated, or in its right place; for if it be disjointed, it will move ſide-wiſe and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179659:281"/>very rarely forwards. However, you muſt put it in its place, as <hi>Bone-ſetters</hi> uſe to do; then ſhaving off all the Hair about the Joint, chafe it with a Mixture of equal parts of <hi>Oil of Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> ſhaken in a Glaſs till they be united. Rub in the <hi>Eſſence</hi> with your Hand, and apply the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> for broken and luxated Bones ſpread on very ſoft Leather, over which lay a <hi>Bolſter</hi> of Flax about a Fingers breadth in thickneſs. Then fit to the Joint ſix very thin Splents four or five Inches long, and two Fingers breadth broad, wrapt about with Flax to keep 'em from hurting the part, and plac'd about the Joint long-wiſe, and at an equal diſtance. Tye 'em on with a Lace or Ribbon a large Fingers breadth broad, and about three Ells long, beginning below and ending above, and bringing the two ends almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Then to keep all tite, wrap a large piece of Cloth about the Joint, and ſew it on.</p>
                        <p>Then chafe the whole Leg and Shoulder with the <hi>Duke's Ointment;</hi> or if the Hurt be in the Joint of the hinder Leg, rub the Thigh, Hough, and Leg with the ſame Ointment. After which, to eaſe the griev'd Leg, hang up the Horſe's Body: In the mean time, to aſſwage the beating or heaving of the Flanks by reaſon of the extream violence of the Pain, you muſt inject every Day at leaſt, two good <hi>Clyſters</hi> made with <hi>Sal-Polycreſt,</hi> for the firſt ſix or ſeven Days. 'Tis the uſual Cuſtom of Farriers to put a <hi>Patten-Shoe</hi> on the contrary Foot, to make the Horſe lean on the griev'd Leg, leſt the Sinews about the <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> ſhould ſhrink; but the poor Creature is hardly able to bear the Pain that cannot be avoided without contriving ways to augment it: And beſides, the Sinews and Ligaments are kept in their due ſituation by the Splents, and the proper Remedies that are apply'd, not only to keep 'em from ſhrinking, but to ſtrengthen 'em, and aſſiſt Nature to regain her former Vigour.</p>
                        <p>Let the firſt Dreſſing remain untouch'd for the ſpace of nine Days; and in the mean time rub the Leg and Shoulder once every two Days with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> pouring a little <hi>Oil of St. John's-wort</hi> upon the Leg, that it may penetrate to the diſlocated Joint, both to moiſten the Plaiſter, and ſtrengthen the Part.</p>
                        <p>Some are falſly perſwaded, that the Cure muſt be begun with letting the Horſe Blood in the <hi>Toes</hi> or tip of the Hoof, but this is a very dangerous Method, for it draws down the Humours to the griev'd Part, which is already oppreſs'd with 'em. 'Tis true indeed, <hi>Bleeding</hi> is very proper in this caſe, and ought always to preceed the Application of any Remedies; but it ought to be adminiſter'd in the <hi>Neck-Veins</hi> where it makes a Revulſion.</p>
                        <p>When you take off the firſt Dreſſing, chafe the Joint with the above-mention'd <hi>Ointment</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> apply a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of the ſame <hi>Ointment,</hi> or that againſt <hi>Fractures,</hi> put on the Splents, and rub the whole Leg with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> letting the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing remain eight and forty Hours. In the mean time keep the Horſe ſtill ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended or hanging, and continue after the ſame manner, till the Part be perfectly ſound.</p>
                        <p>Since thoſe <hi>Diſlocations</hi> can never happen without hurting or looſening the <hi>Shoulder-Bone,</hi> you muſt alſo endeavour to ſtrengthen that Part by the Method preſcrib'd in the Fifty fourth and following Chapters. You may know whether the Bone be fall'n out of its place by feeling and comparing it with the Bone of the other Shoulder: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt you deſpair of Succeſs, tho' you ſhould find it looſen'd; for time and good Remedies will reſtore it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Diſlocations</hi> and <hi>Strains</hi> in the <hi>Fore-Legs</hi> may be cur'd by a careful Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of convenient Remedies, without any prejudice to the Horſe: But if the Hurt be in the <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> of the <hi>Hinder-Legs,</hi> the Cure will at beſt be long and tedious; and beſides <hi>Impoſthumes</hi> are frequently generated which break in the <hi>Leg,</hi> or <hi>Paſtern,</hi> and draw down the Humours in ſo great abundance that they can never be drain'd: And I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes irrecoverably Lam'd, and others Kill'd by ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                        <p>After the Lameneſs is gone, you muſt <hi>give the Fire,</hi> as for <hi>Strains,</hi> to compleat the Cure, and prevent a Relapſe: And if the Lameneſs return, the laſt Remedy and only way to make your Horſe ſound is again to have recourſe to the <hi>Fire.</hi>

                     <p>THeſe Accidents are uſually occaſion'd by an <hi>Over-reach.</hi> For when a Horſe Gallops thro' Ways full of Stones or Ruts, he either ſtrikes his Hinder-Foot againſt the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> of the Fore-Leg, or <hi>interferes</hi> and frets one Leg againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The Contuſion of the <hi>Sinew</hi> is follow'd with a Swelling, Hardneſs, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Weakneſs, and the Horſe is ſometimes quite Lam'd, or at leaſt the Pain makes him Halt more or leſs, according to the various Greatneſs of the Hurt.</p>
                     <p>If you did not ſee the <hi>Sinew ſprain'd,</hi> and therefore could not obſerve where the Foot ſtruck, you muſt feel along the <hi>Sinew,</hi> and where you find a Swelling, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Pain, you may certainly conclude that the Grief lies there; beſides, the Hair is frequently carry'd off by the violence of the Stroke.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Strain</hi> be newly taken, the beſt way to cure it is to anoint the griev'd Part with <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> holding a red-hot Fire-ſhovel near it, that the <hi>Oil</hi> may ſink into the <hi>Sinew,</hi> then chafe the Part again with <hi>Oil,</hi> and continue thus rubbing and anointing for half an Hour, which time is almoſt always ſufficient for the Cure of the <hi>Strain;</hi> but tho' the Pain be aſſwag'd, the Part continues weak, and therefore you muſt chafe it once a Day with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and let the Horſe reſt till the <hi>Sinew</hi> has recover'd its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>The following Remedy will effectually cure a <hi>Sinew-ſprain,</hi> if it be not very old, wrap a wet Cloth, five or ſix times doubl'd about the griev'd Part, and all the reſt of the Leg, and move a Bar of Iron backwards and forwards for a quarter of an Hour, as near as you can without touching the Cloth, which muſt be moiſten'd when it grows dry: Then <hi>ſcarifie</hi> the Swelling, that is, cut the Skin croſs-wiſe (never long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) to let out the bruis'd Blood, taking care not to make the Inciſions deeper than thoſe that are uſually made before the Application of a <hi>Cupping-Glaſs.</hi> After which cleave a <hi>live Cock</hi> or large <hi>Hen,</hi> and apply it warm to the griev'd <hi>Sinew,</hi> tying it on with a Swathe or Bandage, and ſuffering it to remain four and twenty Hours: When that is taken off bathe the Part ſix times a Day with good <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> till it be cur'd.</p>

                     <p>Apply this <hi>Ointment</hi> cold, rubbing it in with your Hand; it cauſes no Swelling or Pain, nor makes one Hair fall off.

                        <p>This is a very ſimple Medicine, yet 'tis frequently attended with better Succeſs than the moſt pompous Compoſitions: 'Tis ſingularly good for old <hi>Sinew-ſprains,</hi> for tho' there be a hard Lump on the griev'd Part, and the <hi>Sinew</hi> it ſelf be ſwoln and hard, this Remedy will compleat the Cure.

                     <p>TAke green <hi>Walnuts</hi> ſo ſmall that when they are cut they are equally ſoft, beat 'em to a Maſh in a Marble Mortar, and ſtrain 'em thro' a Sieve with the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom turn'd up, as <hi>Caſſia</hi> is uſually ſtrain'd, beat that which remains till the whole paſs thro' the Sieve, and put two Pounds of this Pulp or Maſh into a glaz'd Earthen Pot, with a Pound of <hi>Salt</hi> well dry'd, and a Pound and a half of common <hi>Turpentinel</hi> Set the Mixture in a Cellar to ferment fifteen Days, then evaporate the Moiſture over a gentle Fire, ſtirring all the while, till it be reduc'd to the conſiſtence of a <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> which cannot be done without ſome difficulty, and preſerve it in a Pot cloſe cover'd, as an excellent Remedy to reſolve the <hi>Water-farcy,</hi> and all other Swellings. It retains its Virtue Thirty Years.</p>
                     <p>Since the <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> is at ſo great a diſtance from the Center of natural Heat, the Swellings that are form'd in that Part require a powerful Remedy to reſolve 'em: And this <hi>Plaiſter</hi> will do the work, if it be carefully apply'd, and renew'd every eight Days, ſhaving off the Hair, and continuing after the ſame manner till the Swelling be perfectly diſſolv'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXIX. <hi>Of an</hi> Attaint <hi>or</hi> Over-reach.</head>
                     <p>AN <hi>Attaint</hi> proceeds either from a Blow with another Horſe's Foot, that takes off the piece above the <hi>Cronet,</hi> or from an <hi>Over-reach,</hi> when a Horſe ſtrikes his Hinder-Foot againſt his Fore-Leg.</p>
                     <p>You may eaſily know an <hi>Attaint</hi> by the Wound or piece of Fleſh that is torn away, by the Blood which flows out, and the halting of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Waſh away the filth or dirt with <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and if there be any looſe piece of Fleſh, cut it off; then take a hard <hi>Egg</hi> cut thro' the middle, ſprinkle it with <hi>Pepper,</hi> and apply it hot, tying it faſt to the griev'd Part. If the Horſe be not cur'd by the firſt Application repeat it the next Day.</p>
                     <p>In froſty Weather, when Horſes are rough-ſhod, or their Shoes made with long Caulks, they are apt to over-reach, and make a hole above the <hi>Cronet</hi> or in the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> which is not without danger: And therefore you muſt immediately waſh the Wound with warm <hi>Vinegar,</hi> then fill it with <hi>Pepper,</hi> and lay over it a <hi>black re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent Charge,</hi> made of <hi>Chimney-ſoot, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> or of <hi>Bole</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or (which is beſt of all) of <hi>Lime</hi> temper'd with Water. Repeat the ſame the next Day, and the Cure will be perfected. For an <hi>Over-reach</hi> by the Caulk of the Shoes, fill the Hole with <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> beaten and temper'd with Spittle, as they uſually make <hi>Touch-Powder,</hi> then ſet Fire to it, and repeat the ſame the next Day. In the mean time both the Foot and Wound muſt be carefully preſerv'd from Moiſture; and if the <hi>Attaint</hi> be from time to time waſh'd with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> it will heal (tho' never ſo deep) if the Tendon be not hurt.</p>
                     <p>If the Cure do not proceed according to your deſire, melt a little of the <hi>Emplaſtrum divinum</hi> with <hi>Oil of Roſes</hi> in a Spoon, and fill the Hole with Cotton dipt in this <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> laying a Plaiſter of the ſame over it, and dreſſing the Horſe every Day after the ſame manner till the Cure be perfected, as it will be ſpeedily, if the <hi>Tendon</hi> or <hi>Griſtle</hi> be not hurt. If the Hole be deep, and notwithſtanding all theſe Remedies, the Horſe continue ſtill to Halt, or the Part above the <hi>Attaint</hi> be ſwoln, the Hoof ſhrunk, and the Foot contracted beneath, you have reaſon to fear that the <hi>Tendon</hi> is griev'd; and therefore you muſt carefully examine the Part with your Probe, and if you find that the Hole reaches to the <hi>Tendon,</hi> dreſs it according to the Directions that ſhall be given for the <hi>Quitter-Bones.</hi> If the <hi>Attaint</hi> be neglected on a Journey, tho' the Horſe do not Halt at the firſt, by reaſon of the Corruption that is generated by the Cold and Foulneſs of the Part, the Sore may reach the Hoof; in which caſe, after one or two Applications of the <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> you muſt proceed to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> and dreſs it as a <hi>Quitter-bone.</hi> 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Sore will never Heal, ſo long as the Horſe licks it; and therefore you muſt cover it with the Remedies that ſhall be deſcrib'd in the following Chapters.</p>
                     <p>If the bottom of the Hole be foul, tho' the <hi>Griſtle</hi> be not ſpoil'd, which you may know by ſearching with your Probe, to hinder the Corruption from reaching thither, eſpecially if it breeds Matter, or if you perceive a Swelling or Hardneſs above, or at the ſide of the Part, you muſt waſh it with Warm Wine, and fill the Hole with <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> renewing the ſame upon occaſion. If the Cure prove tedious, and the Horſe begin to Halt, the Swelling growing big and hard, and voiding Matter, you muſt have recourſe to the Chapter that treats of <hi>Quitter-bones;</hi> for you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude that the <hi>Griſtle</hi> is hurt, and muſt be extirpated, or the Sore will never be cur'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXX. <hi>Of the</hi> Scratches.</head>
                     <p>THere are three Sorts of <hi>Scratches; Simple, Sinewy,</hi> and <hi>Scratches in the Hoof,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Quitter-bones.</hi> The <hi>ſimple Scratches</hi> are moſt uſual, being a Tumor caus'd by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humours contain'd in the Skin and the Fleſh. It grows in all the parts of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,</hi> eſpecially behind, and the Horſe voids by this Channel or Gutter, all the deprav'd Humours that were gather'd in that Part. The <hi>Scratches</hi> in a Horſe reſemble a Corn in a Man's Foot; he cannot endure you to touch the Sore, and it uſually makes him halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſuppurated, that is, before the Corruption be diſcharg'd. Sometimes the <hi>Scratches</hi> are the Reliques of the <hi>Strangles,</hi> or of the Impurities expell'd by Nature: ſometimes they proceed from Hurts and Bruiſes; and they are alſo occaſion'd by the Dirt and Fleſh that ſticks to the <hi>Paſterns,</hi> which growing hot and ſharp, frets and corrodes the Skin. The <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Plain Scratches</hi> are moſt eaſily cur'd, and the Horſe is perfectly ſound when they are taken away. The <hi>ſinewy Scratches,</hi> ſo call'd, becauſe they are either under, above, or at the Side of the <hi>Sinews,</hi> may be divided into Three Kinds, but the Firſt is very rare.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a Tumour generated under one of the <hi>Sinews</hi> of the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> which hinders the Matter from running out, and cauſes ſo violent a Pain, that the Horſe is ſeiz'd with a Fever, and halts right down: for all the ſoftening and aſſwaging Remedies in the World cannot penetrate to the Swelling that lies under the <hi>Sinews</hi> and <hi>Tendons</hi> of the <hi>Paſtern.</hi> The Part is remote from the Heart, which is the Principle of Heat, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by its own Force digeſt thoſe crude and raw Humours; ſo that the Horſe muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſuffer cruel Torments, and for the moſt part periſh. This Diſeaſe is more dangerous than the <hi>Quitter-bone</hi> and the Cure is always extremely difficult.</p>
                     <p>The Second Sort of <hi>ſinewy Scratches</hi> grows on one of the <hi>Sinews</hi> of the <hi>Paſtern;</hi> it ſwells the <hi>Paſtern</hi> and <hi>Leg,</hi> makes the Horſe very lame, and frequently ſends forth a great Scab inſtead of corrupt Matter. In this Caſe you muſt charge the Leg, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a good ſoftening Remedy; after the Scurf is fall'n, dreſs the Sore with <hi>Schmits Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or (for want of that) with what follows. Take a pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> in fine Powder; Mix and thicken 'em with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Wheat-flower,</hi> adding a ſmall Glaſs-full of good <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi> Apply this Ointment with flax to the Sores, and dreſs 'em every day, bathing the Leg, and eſpecially the griev'd Sinew, with warm Wine mix'd with a little Butter, and the Horſe will grow ſound.</p>
                     <p>There is a Third and very dangerous Kind of <hi>ſinewy Scratches,</hi> which breeds at the ſide of the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> on the hinder-Legs, and the nearer it grows to the <hi>Sinew</hi> the more malignant it is, and the Cure leſs eaſie. Many Horſes have been incurably lam'd, after a continual Application of Remedies for ſeven or eight Months. Theſe <hi>Scratches</hi> are very painful, for they make the Horſe halt right down, and forſake his Meat; they occaſion a Fever, and almoſt all the Horſes that are troubl'd with 'em are ſo tormented that they cannot put their Foot to the Ground, and at laft they ſink under the miſerable Pain. Having explain'd the Three Sorts of <hi>ſinewy Scratches,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Third Member of the firſt Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>The Third Sort of <hi>Scratches,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Quitter-bone,</hi> is ſeated between the <hi>Cronet</hi> and <hi>Hoof,</hi> and is alſo very dangerous, becauſe it makes the Horſe caſt his Hoof, which much diminiſhes his Value, for the new Hoof is hardly ever fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have briefly run over the ſeveral Kinds of <hi>Scratches,</hi> and I ſhall propoſe the Remedies for 'em in the ſame Order.</p>
                     <div type="section">

                           <hi>Remedies for</hi> ſimple Scratches.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>ſimple Scratches</hi> are cur'd by taking out the Piece of Rotten Fleſh that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fleſh and the Skin. In order to that end, take the quantity of an Egg of <hi>Leaven</hi> made of <hi>Rye-Meal,</hi> two or three Heads of <hi>Garlick</hi> beaten, and as much <hi>Pepper</hi> as you can lift with the Ends of three Fingers; temper 'em with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and apply the Mixture to the ſore place. This is certainly a very good Remedy, for in four and twenty hours it brings forth the corrupt Piece of Fleſh, without leaving any Foulneſs at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179659:284"/>the Bottom of the Sore. If you cannot procure <hi>Rye-Leaven,</hi> take <hi>Leaven</hi> made of <hi>Wheat-Dough;</hi> or prepare the following Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Take the <hi>Bulbs</hi> of two or three <hi>Leeks,</hi> or (for want of theſe) two white <hi>Onions</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; incorporate 'em with the bigneſs of an Egg of <hi>Hog's Lard,</hi> and as much <hi>Muſtard-ſeed</hi> as you can take up with the Ends of your Fingers: Apply this Remedy to the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, renewing it once a day, and the rotten Fleſh will quickly come forth; then waſh the Part with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and apply to the Sore the above-mention'd Ointment of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> and <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> by which Method, continu'd for ſome time, the Cure will be ſpeedily perfected. If the Scab or Scurf that falls off be very large, as ſometimes it is, you muſt cleanſe the Sore with fine Flax, and apply the already-mention'd Ointment; which is very excellent for this Purpoſe; or rub the Part with the Herb call'd <hi>Greater Celandine,</hi> which grows always in ſhady places, and has a yellow Juice. You muſt beat it, and ſqueeze out the Juice to rub the Part, and bind the bruis'd Herbs upon it; for there is not a more powerful Dryer in the World. Or you may take out the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fleſh thus:</p>
                        <p>Chop two or three <hi>Onions,</hi> boil 'em in Water with <hi>Mallows</hi> and <hi>Ground-ſell;</hi> of each one handful: ſtrain out the Water and throw it away; then add a handful of raw <hi>Sorrel</hi> to the other Ingredients, beat 'em all together to a Paſte, which muſt be thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd with <hi>Flower of Linſeed</hi> to the Conſiſtence of a <hi>Pultiſs.</hi> Spread it on Lint, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it hot to the <hi>Scratches.</hi> If the Tumour be very hard, add a little <hi>Hog's Greaſe</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicum</hi> before you put in the <hi>Linſeed,</hi> and apply as before, renewing the ſame once in four and twenty Hours, if there be Occaſion; for one or two Applications will take out the rotten piece of Fleſh, leaving a Hole, which muſt be dreſs'd as before.</p>
                        <p>Young Horſes are very ſubject to this Kind of <hi>Scratches.</hi> I ſhall name ſeveral Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are good for it, that every one may chuſe which he pleaſes: <hi>Old Oil, Butter,</hi> the <hi>Fat</hi> or <hi>Greaſe</hi> of <hi>Hens, Geeſe, Ducks,</hi> and <hi>Hogs,</hi> the <hi>Marrow</hi> of <hi>Stags</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> which may be made up with <hi>Rye-flower</hi> and <hi>Crums</hi> of <hi>Bread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are alſo very good, and cheap Remedies, and eaſily prepar'd; and beſides you may uſe the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> call'd <hi>Diachylum,</hi> that of the <hi>Mucilages,</hi> or <hi>Baſilicum.</hi>

                     <p>THE above-mention'd Remedies will not produce any conſiderable Effect in the Cure of the firſt Kind of <hi>ſinewy Scratches,</hi> which lie ſo deep that they cannot ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; for the <hi>Sinews</hi> that cover 'em hinder the Operation of the Remedies. The <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> (which you will find deſcrib'd in the Hundred eighty fourth <hi>Chapter</hi>) will more effectually ſoften the Part, if you add <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Linſeed,</hi> and apply the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy round the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> charging the whole Leg with cold <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> to prevent the falling down of the Humours.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Appearance that the Swelling is diſpos'd to come to a Head in any part of it, you muſt pierce the Skin with a hot Iron round the part, making eight or ten Holes according to the Largeneſs of the ſpace, in form of a Circle; and ſometimes beyond the part, according to the Room you have, and the Probability of drawing the Matter, by opening theſe Paſſages. If the Matter appear in any part, apply a Rowler of ſoft Linnen, moiſten'd with <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> and over that a <hi>Pultiſs</hi> of the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> as I intimated before, keeping the Leg always charg'd with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> or <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> and continuing to dreſs the Sore every day till the Scabs fall off, or till you perceive that 'tis fit to apply <hi>repelling Remedies;</hi> for Example, if the Skin between the two Holes be looſen'd from the Fleſh, and the Matter flow too abundantly, you muſt lay aſide the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> and make uſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Heat a Pound or two of common <hi>Turpentine</hi> in an Earthen Pot, by degrees, ſtirring it all the while with a wooden Slice; thicken it with very fine <hi>Soot,</hi> ſtirring always over a gentle Fire, till it be reduc'd to the Thickneſs of a <hi>Honey-Charge.</hi> Then ſpread it on Flax, and apply it warm to the Part, but you muſt firſt waſh the Sore with <hi>Aqua-Vitae.</hi> This <hi>Charge</hi> is in ſome meaſure <hi>Reſtringent;</hi> it takes away the Heat, and hinders the Humours from flowing too abundantly to the griev'd Part.</p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:179659:285"/>
                     <p>As often as you heat the <hi>Reſtringent Charge,</hi> you muſt ſtir it all the while 'tis near the Fire, for otherwiſe 'twill turn knotty.</p>
                     <p>Let the Horſe feed on <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and make him wholly abſtain from <hi>Oats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Sort of <hi>Scratches</hi> muſt never be neglected, for all your Care, and the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedies you can apply or imagine, will hardly be able to ripen it: I ſhall in the next place, proceed to propoſe ſome Remedies for the <hi>Scratches</hi> that breed upon the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> and (tho' without any Danger) make the Horſe halt before the Corruption come forth.

                        <p>Theſe <hi>Scratches</hi> grow in the <hi>Paſtern</hi> upon the <hi>Sinew;</hi> they are accompany'd with extreme Pain, and make the Horſe halt, but yield to the effectual Operation of proper Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, you muſt rub the ſwoll'n Leg daily with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and afterwards bring forth the Corruption or rotten Bit of Fleſh, with one of the Remedies deſcrib'd in the laſt Chapter, as that made of <hi>Rye-flower</hi> and <hi>Garlick,</hi> or that which is compos'd of <hi>Leeks</hi> and old <hi>Hog's Greaſe;</hi> or one of thoſe that follow.</p>
                        <p>Take freſh <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> of each four Ounces; heat 'em with half a Pint of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, and thicken 'em with two Ounces of <hi>Linſeed-flower:</hi> Then boil, as if you were going to make <hi>Gruel,</hi> adding (a little before you take the Skellet from the fire) two Ounces of <hi>Pigeon's Dung</hi> in powder, and charge the Sore warm, having firſt clipp'd off the Hair with Scizzars.</p>
                        <p>If that do not anſwer your Expectation; take Leaves of <hi>Colt's-foot, long Sorrel,</hi> and <hi>Mallows,</hi> of each one Handful; bake 'em under the Embers, then beat and incorporate 'em with ſalt <hi>Butter.</hi> This Remedy being apply'd hot, will draw forth the Rotten Piece of Fleſh; but if it fail,</p>
                        <p>Bake or roaſt four <hi>Lilly Roots</hi> under the Aſhes, beat, and add <hi>Hen's Greaſe,</hi> or any other convenient <hi>Greaſe,</hi> three Ounces, <hi>Linſeed-Oil</hi> two Ounces, the <hi>Yolks</hi> of two hard <hi>Eggs:</hi> Incorporate all together in a Mortar, applying ſome of it to the <hi>Scratches</hi> with Flax, and laying a Cover over it.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Sinew</hi> of the Leg be ſwoll'n, keep it always <hi>charg'd,</hi> and aſſoon as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fleſh is come forth, waſh the ſwoll'n Leg with warm <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> or chafe it with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and fill the Hole with a Tent of fine Flax moiſten'd with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicum,</hi> which will ripen the reſt of the rotten Fleſh, and cleanſe the Sore: but if there be frothy and foul Fleſh in the Hole, dip your Tent in <hi>Agyptiacum,</hi> which will cleanſe the Part, and make the dead Fleſh fall away.</p>
                        <p>When the Fleſh appears fair and clean, apply the Juice of <hi>greater Celandine,</hi> binding on the bruis'd Herbs, or <hi>Charcoal-duſt,</hi> or burnt <hi>Copperas,</hi> which dries more powerfully, or ſears'd <hi>Aſhes.</hi> Some uſe only to waſh the Sore with <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> or <hi>Urine,</hi> and ſtrew it with burnt <hi>Oyſter-ſhells,</hi> or old <hi>Boat-Ropes</hi> dry'd and beaten to powder.</p>
                        <p>If the Wound or Sore, occaſion'd by the coming forth of the rotten Bit of Fleſh, be very large, you may cleanſe it with the <hi>Mundificative of Opium,</hi> and then dry it with the <hi>Unguentum Martiatum</hi> or <hi>Ointment of Steel,</hi> if you are loth to give your ſelf the trouble of compoſing the <hi>Ointment</hi> made of <hi>Honey, Verdigreaſe, Spirit of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Flower.</hi>

                           </gap>d with ſo violent a Pain, and ſo much Danger, that not only the Horſe ſeldom or never puts his Foot to the Ground, but certainly periſhes if he be not ſeaſonably and effectually aſſiſted; and it happens not unfrequently that the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies cannot ſave him from downright Lameneſs.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, you muſt let him blood in the <hi>Neck-Vein,</hi> keep him ſuſpended or hanging, if he cannot lean on the ſore Foot, or litter him well that he may lie down, if you perceive that he hath Vigour enough to riſe again; for 'tis a very troubleſome and unprofitable Method to keep Horſes hanging, if it can be avoided: nor muſt you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179659:285"/>put 'em in ſo unnatural a Poſture without extreme Neceſſity. Afterwards apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge</hi> upon and about the Sore to ripen it, and chafe the whole Leg with <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> or if that cannot be procur'd, with <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> cold, renewing the Applications till the corrupt Fleſh come forth. Beſides you muſt <hi>take up</hi> the Vein on top of the Thigh, and draw a <hi>Star</hi> with a hot Iron under the Hough, if the Leg be not too much <hi>gourded,</hi> which will put ſome ſtop to the flowing down of the Humours. In the mean time apply the <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> or ſome other ſoftening Remedies, to haſten the falling away of the rotten Fleſh, if there be any; tho' even after that is come forth the Horſe oftentimes remains as before, that is, unable to reſt on the griev'd Foot; in which Caſe you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> about the Sore, piercing the Skin with a dozen of Holes, and continue the Application of the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> as before. After the Scabs occaſion'd by the Fire, are fall'n off, if your Horſe be ſtill in as bad a Condition as formerly, you muſt open the Part with a red-hot Knife; for when the rotten Fleſh comes forth, it hardly leaves an open Hole, but a foul Sore that oftentimes throws out a <hi>red Water,</hi> or burnt and yellowiſh Matter, both which proceed from the <hi>Sinew,</hi> and in the mean time your Horſe continues to be very lame, and even unable to ſet his Foot to the Ground. The running of the <hi>ſinewy Matter</hi> denotes the extreme Weakneſs of the Part and of the Sinews, ſo that the Natural Motion is interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and you will never be able to ſtop the Courſe of the Matter which dries and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Sinews; but by drawing Lines with a Searing-Iron about the whole Leg, both on the Inſide and Outſide, from the Hough downwards, and covering it with a good Plaiſter to concentrate the natural Heat.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Scratches</hi> will throw your Horſe into a Fever, ſpoil his Appetite, and at laſt kill him, if you be not very careful to prevent thoſe fatal Accidents, by adminiſtring fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently good <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Sal Polychreſt.</hi> If he forſake his Meat utterly you may feed him with a Horn, as you were taught in the Beginning of this Book, and give him <hi>white Water</hi> to drink, dreſſing him every day with the utmoſt Diligence.</p>
                        <p>'Twill be very convenient in this Caſe to give the Horſe two Ounces of <hi>Liver of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> reduc'd to powder, and mix'd with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> if you can make him eat it with <hi>Bran;</hi> and the next day an Ounce of the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> in the ſame Bran: the third day let him reſt without giving him any thing; on the fourth give him <hi>Liver of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> on the fifth the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi> and nothing on the ſixth day; continuing after the ſame manner till your Horſe recover. This Method will very much advance the Cure; for the Powder diſſipates the Humours that fall upon the griev'd Part. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that Horſes who are oftentimes troubl'd with this Kind of <hi>Scratches</hi> dare not touch the Ground with the ſore Foot for twenty or twenty five Days; and tho' the Sore begins only on one ſide of the Leg, there happens a Tranſlation of the Humours, which paſſing between the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> and the <hi>Bone,</hi> appear on the other ſide, where they cauſe a painful Swelling without any Opening: and therefore you muſt take the following Method to widen the Paſſage.</p>
                        <p>Take a crooked <hi>Probe,</hi> and ſearch the bottom of the Sore which penetrates under the <hi>Sinew;</hi> but if it run ſo deep beneath the Sinew, that you perceive by your Probe that it reaches to the <hi>Tendons</hi> or the moving part of the Joint, you muſt not venture an <hi>Inciſion</hi> leſt you throw the Horſe into a Fever, and perhaps kill him. For <hi>Inciſion</hi> is only proper when the <hi>Probe</hi> paſſes directly to the Bone, and from thence under the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> to the other ſide of the Leg: but if it hits againſt the Sinew, clip off all the Hair of the Leg, and <hi>give the Fire</hi> on both ſides from the Hough downward, drawing the Lines according to the uſual Manner, in an even rank, reaching under the Joint below, at the diſtance of half a Finger's breadth from each other; and at the Sore burn a long Hole quite thro' the Skin, with eight or ten little Holes about it, all pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Skin. You will alſo perceive a Swelling over-againſt the Sore on the other ſide of the <hi>Sinew,</hi> and therefore you muſt alſo pierce the Skin with five or ſix little Holes in that part; then <hi>bar</hi> the Vein, <hi>giving the Fire</hi> in form of a Star above on the ſlat part of the Thigh; and below under the Hough, to ſtop the Courſe of the Humours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which cover the whole Leg with <hi>black Pitch</hi> melted, and above that with <hi>Butter,</hi> wrapping it about with a Cover, and leaving the Leg in that poſture nine or ten days, till the Scabs be ſeparated. The <hi>Fire</hi> thus given ſtops the Courſe of the Humours, which otherwiſe would have fall'n in too great Abundance on the griev'd Part; and ſo prevents the drying up of the Sinews, for in this Diſeaſe the Humour that ſhou'd nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thoſe Parts runs out in form of Matter, and makes the Horſe unfit for Service even after the Cure.</p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:179659:286"/>
                        <p>You muſt inject <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Sal-Polycreſt,</hi> to allay the beating or heaving of the Flanks that will be occaſion'd by the Burning. Litter your Horſe well, feed him with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and afterwards dreſs the Sore like an ordinary Wound with <hi>Schmit's Ointment.</hi> If there be occaſion to <hi>give the Fire</hi> again, to let out ſome Matter ſhut up between the Skin and the Fleſh, you muſt not loſe time out of fear or heſitancy, but proceed with all poſſible diligence, for this is one of the moſt dangerous Diſeaſes to which Horſes are obnoxious.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall, in the next place, deſcribe the manner of making an <hi>Inciſion,</hi> which is only proper when the Probe paſſes directly to the Bone, or aſcends without reaching the Tendons or Sinew, or running into the Joint. In ſuch a caſe you muſt make a large Inciſion from above downwards, with a red-hot Knife, piercing to the Bone; then finding by the Probe that the Hole paſſes under the Sinew near the Bone to the other ſide, you muſt lay open the Part where the Probe hits, making another deep Inciſion as before; then ſearch again with your Probe, whether there be any other bottom of the Sore, or whether the Hole runs any other way; for you muſt cut open the whole Sore to the bottom with your red-hot Knife, and afterwards draw Lines with a Searing-Iron at the ſide of the Inciſions, reaching both above and below 'em, to bind and ſtrengthen the Part, and hinder the falling down of the Humours; you muſt alſo <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Plait-Vein,</hi> and ſear five or ſix Lines in form of a <hi>Star,</hi> both below and under the Hough; then anoint the Inciſions, made with the red-hot Knife, with <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> covering 'em with Flax; two Days after renew the Application, letting it remain two Days longer to mitigate the Pain caus'd by the Fire, for in four Days the <hi>Oil</hi> will abate the adventitious and unnatural Heat; after which you may dreſs the Inciſions like ordinary Wounds, with <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> uſing your utmoſt diligence to hinder the Fleſh from growing too faſt; for you muſt certainly expect to be troubl'd with Proud-Fleſh, if you dreſs not the Sores daily with <hi>Schmit's</hi> or the <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> which laſt is a true <hi>Mundifier</hi> or <hi>Cleanſer;</hi> but by waſhing the Sores with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> and then applying the <hi>Ointment</hi> as often as you take off the Dreſſing, you may keep 'em clean and ſweet, and afterwards dry 'em with the ſame Water, and Powder of old <hi>Ropes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Inciſions</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> will doubtleſs occaſion a Beating or Heaving in your Horſe's Flanks; and therefore you muſt adminiſter proper <hi>Clyſters,</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Polycreſt,</hi> and give him a like quantity of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in his <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi> If he will not eat his Bran with <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> inſtead of that give him about an Ounce of the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi> once every two Days.</p>
                        <p>If the Fleſh grow too faſt, you may conſume it with the following <hi>Cauſtic,</hi> which is alſo very good to exfoliate or ſcale the Bone of the Foot, when 'tis prick'd or ſtubb'd, and to cleanſe foul Wounds or Sores.</p>

                        <p>If you perceive that the Fleſh grows too faſt, or in too great abundance, in the Wounds made by Inciſion, or that the Sores are foul and frothy, before you apply <hi>Schmit</hi>'s, or the <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> you muſt waſh the part with this <hi>Cauſtic:</hi> Then dry it carefully and apply the <hi>Ointment,</hi> covering it with Flax.

                        </p>

                        <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that when <hi>Scratches</hi> of this Kind break forth in the <hi>Encreaſe of the Moon,</hi> they are extremely ſtubborn and can hardly be conquer'd by the Application of Remedies; but if they appear in the <hi>Wane,</hi> the Cure will be leſs difficult.</p>
                        <p>My Practice has furniſh'd me with ſome occaſions to attempt the cure of Horſes in this condition: Two of 'em continu'd to halt above half a Year; ſome were utterly lam'd, and others were ſpeedily cur'd, eſpecially when the nature of the Diſtemper requir'd Inciſion.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:179659:286"/>
                        <p>I remember one Inſtance of <hi>Sinewy Scratches,</hi> which was accompany'd with terrible Symptoms; and I'm perſwaded a particular Account of that Caſe will give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a clearer view of the extream difficulty of the Cure, than all the Arguments I could alledge to convince him of it.</p>
                        <p>I began the Cure with <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> ordering the Skin to be pierc'd with ſeven Holes, and afterwards I apply'd a good <hi>Honey-Charge</hi> all about the Part. I charg'd the contrary Thigh and Leg, leſt it ſhou'd be <hi>founder'd;</hi> for the Horſe cou'd not reſt on the griev'd Leg, and I commanded him to be dreſs'd every day: After eight days the Diſeaſe fell wholly down upon the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> and broke out in five or ſix Places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the edge of the Hoof; upon ſight of which I immediately caus'd the <hi>Sole</hi> to be taken out, and apply'd <hi>defenſives</hi> round the <hi>Cronet,</hi> made with Powder of <hi>unſlack'd Lime,</hi> temper'd with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> for I was afraid leſt the Hoof ſhould fall off, becauſe the <hi>Cronet</hi> was ſwoln above an Inch. The <hi>Red Honey-Charge</hi> was apply'd above, and the ſwelling of the <hi>Cronet,</hi> which was two or three Fingers breadth broad, was charg'd with the above-mention'd <hi>defenſive.</hi> Over the dreſſing I apply'd <hi>Splents</hi> or <hi>Rowls</hi> of twiſted Flax, and bound 'em on carefully with a Lace. I was alſo oblig'd to order ſeveral Holes to be burnt quite thro' the Skin, in thoſe Parts of the <hi>Paſtern</hi> where the Matter appear'd, and even afterwards to lay open the ſpaces between the Holes, to give a freer Paſſage to the Matter which ran out in great quantity, and was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly bad, for 'twas half digeſted and bloody.</p>
                        <p>But perceiving, at the end of five Weeks, that the Cure was ſo little advanc'd that the Horſe would not put his Foot to the Ground, I thought 'twou'd be convenient to uſe ſome other <hi>Defenſive,</hi> which might not only allay the Pain more effectually, but alſo bind and ſtrengthen the Part. I took then two Pounds of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> to which being heated, I added by degrees a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Soot</hi> well beaten, ſtirring the Matter about without intermiſſion, till it was reduc'd by boiling, to the thickneſs of a <hi>Charge;</hi> which I apply'd not only about the <hi>Cronet,</hi> but alſo round the <hi>Joint,</hi> as far as the Swelling reach'd, rubbing the Leg with the <hi>Duke's Ointment.</hi> Over the <hi>Defenſive Charge</hi> below, I laid Flax with a cover, and above that on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> I fitted Splents with another Bandage to keep all ſure. After two Applications, the Horſe was able to lean upon his griev'd Leg; and at length was cur'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd uſe of the laſt mention'd Remedy. But perceiving that the Part continu'd ſtill ſwoln, and that the Foot was very much dry'd, I caus'd the Sole to be taken out, and four Days after the whole length of the Leg to be ſear'd, drawing the Lines from the bending of the Hough to the <hi>Cronet;</hi> and beſides, I order'd a good Plaiſter to be apply'd to the burnt Parts, and cover'd with Hurds or Flocks, till the Scabs fell away; and then the Sores were heal'd with the uſual Remedies, and the Sole alſo. After which the Horſe was led every Day thro' till'd Grounds, for a Month together. At laſt he recover'd his Fleſh, the nouriſhment return'd to his Hip and Leg, his Sinews grew vigorous, and were extended to their natural length, he became fit for Service, and after four Months, was compleatly cur'd of this grievous Diſtemper, which I thought fit to deſcribe, that it may ſerve as a Model in all caſes of the ſame Nature.</p>
                        <p>I believe this Horſe could not have been preſerv'd, if he had not, during the whole progreſs of the Cure, continu'd to lie down and riſe with the help of his three ſound Legs, and kept a good Appetite to his Meat. As often as we perceiv'd a Beating or Heaving in his Flank, <hi>Clyſters</hi> were not ſpar'd, no more than the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and that of <hi>Montpelier</hi> for his Thighs and Legs: And if he had not been both a fine and a good Horſe, his Cure would have certainly coſt more than his real Value. To conclude, he was not ſuffer'd to eat <hi>Oats,</hi> during three Months, but was fed with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> good <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Straw;</hi> he was always well Litter'd, and lodg'd in a little Stable by himſelf.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXII. <hi>Of the</hi> Third <hi>ſort of</hi> Scratches, <hi>commonly call'd</hi> Quitter-Bone.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Quitter-bone</hi> is a Swelling on the <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Cronet,</hi> which is greater or leſs according to the length of time from its firſt appearance. It proceeds from corrupt Matter generated between the Hoof and the Bone of the Foot, which rotting and infecting the <hi>Tendon</hi> or <hi>Griſtle</hi> under the <hi>Cronet,</hi> draws the Humours thither that occaſion the Swelling. Nature, in purſuance of her wonted Methods, to reſiſt and endeavour to expel every thing that is corrupted, opens a Hole in the Tumour, which is wide enough to let forth part of the Matter, but not to give a paſſage to the <hi>Griſtle:</hi> And therefore, ſince the Cure depends on the utter extirpation of the rotten and infected part of the <hi>Griſtle,</hi> you muſt perform that Operation either with a <hi>Razor,</hi> or red-hot <hi>Knife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is eaſily known, but the Cure is difficult. You muſt, in the firſt place, ſearch with your <hi>Probe</hi> how far the Hole reaches; for if it enter deep into the Hoof, under the <hi>Cronet,</hi> that part which lies beneath the Swelling, ſhrinks and dries up, and oftentimes the Horſe halts right down; but if (as it ſometimes happens) the Foot be not dry'd or ſhrunk under the Tumour, the Horſe halts little or not at all.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to the Cure, it muſt be obſerv'd, that between the Hoof and the Bone of the Foot, there is a white Griſtle call'd a <hi>Tendon,</hi> which is inſenſible: 'tis about half an Inch broad, extending in length from the Heels, almoſt to the laſt Nail of the Shoe, both in the fore and hinder Feet. There are two of thoſe <hi>Tendons</hi> in every Foot, one on the inſide and the other on the outſide, which begin and end over againſt each other; and at the Toe, or that part of the Foot which firſt touches the Ground, there are more than three Finger's breadth between the ends of the Griſtles. Now the <hi>Tendon</hi> being infected by the Matter that is generated near it, the Neighbouring Parts diſcharge their Humours upon it, which occaſions the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and the Infection ſpreading by degrees, the Corruption encreaſes, and ſeizes on the whole <hi>Griſtle,</hi> if its progreſs be not prevented by cutting out that part; for the putrefaction cannot otherwiſe be ſtopp'd, and part of the <hi>Tendon</hi> muſt be extirpated to preſerve the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Over-reaches</hi> or <hi>Attaints</hi> on the <hi>Cronet</hi> proceed from an external Cauſe, but they produce the ſame effect; for when the <hi>Cronet</hi> of one of the Horſe's Feet is hurt by the Shoe of the other Foot, or any other way, the bruis'd Fleſh uſually turns to Matter, which touching the <hi>Tendon</hi> corrupts it; or the <hi>Tendon</hi> is immediately hurt by the Blow; in both which caſes the ſame Diſorders are occaſion'd that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the <hi>Quitter-bone</hi> neither is there the leaſt difference in the cure.</p>
                     <p>It happens not unfrequently, that the Cure of thoſe <hi>Attaints</hi> which reach the <hi>Tendon,</hi> is extreamly fallacious, even after the Hole is clos'd up, and the Sore heal'd: Thus a Man is apt to imagine that the Horſe is perfectly ſound when he cannot perceive the leaſt appearance of any Hurt or Lameneſs; for by reaſon of the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the <hi>Griſtle</hi> many Horſes do not Halt, tho' the Part be hurt: But in the mean time the Humours gather in it, and by degrees breed a large <hi>Attaint,</hi> which may lurk ſix Months, becauſe the Horſe hardly feels it, and the Matter that corrupts the <hi>Tendon</hi> is neither ſharp nor malignant during all that time.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Sorances</hi> are more dangerous and difficult to be cur'd, when they are on the inſide of the Foot, than when they breed on the out-ſide, and the deeper they reach, the Cure will advance more ſlowly. For the <hi>Griſtle</hi> lies deeper under the <hi>Cronet</hi> in ſome Horſes than in others, and the <hi>Probe</hi> paſſes ſometimes between the Hoof and the Bone of the Foot, to the part beneath the Sole.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd either by <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> or by the <hi>Razor,</hi> and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Cauteries.</hi> Both theſe Methods are good, but if the Grief be old you muſt immediately, and without loſing time, rip up the Sore or Tumour with a Razor to the very bottom, ſparing neither Hoof nor Fleſh, but cutting out all that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, either under the Hoof or in any other part of the Foot. If the Hurt be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179659:287"/>newly taken, you may chuſe which Method you pleaſe; but 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Fire</hi> ſpoils the ſhape of the Foot, which remains long (and oftentimes ever) after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards disfigur'd, at leaſt the Marks of the <hi>Fire</hi> can never be taken away. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall begin with the ſafeſt, ſureſt, and moſt generally receiv'd Method of Cure, which may be thus perform'd with the help of a <hi>Razor.</hi> After you have ſearch'd the bottom of the Sore with your <hi>Probe,</hi> conſider how far the Swelling reaches towards the Toe (for it never ſtretches to the Heels) concluding that the <hi>Tendon</hi> is corrupted as far as the Swelling extends. The main ſcope of the Cure is to take out the <hi>Griſtle;</hi> in order to which you muſt examine with a <hi>Probe,</hi> whether the Sore penetrates very deep between the Hoof and the Bone of the Foot, for in that caſe you muſt begin with taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> which will be a great ſtep towards the Cure: But if you find by the <hi>Probe</hi> that the <hi>Tendon</hi> does not lie very deep, the taking out of the <hi>Sole</hi> may be omitted, tho' that Operation be not only very ſafe, but extreamly uſeful in all caſes whatſoever. Four or five Days after put in the <hi>Probe</hi> to the <hi>Tendon,</hi> to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate which, you muſt ſhave away the Hair off the Part where you intend to begin the extirpation of the <hi>Griſtle,</hi> about half a Fingers breadth beyond the Swelling towards the Toe, and open the Part with a red-hot Iron as far as the <hi>Tendon,</hi> which you muſt feel with a <hi>crooked Slice,</hi> or rather with your Finger, and therefore the Hole ought to be made wide enough to receive your middle Finger or Thumb, if the Horſe be of a large ſize. Then mix two Drams of <hi>Aloes,</hi> with ſix Drams of <hi>Sublimate,</hi> both in fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of which take a ſufficient quantity, and with <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> make a little Ball to be thruſt into the Hole, as far as the <hi>Tendon.</hi> In the next place make a Tent of Flax, ſufficient to fill the whole capacity of the Hole, and daubing it over with the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Powder, mixt with <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Ointment,</hi> put it into the Hole. Beſides, you muſt prepare another Tent after the ſame manner, and thruſt it as far as you can into the Sore; and if the Hole be not large enough to receive the Tent, you may widen it by putting in your red-hot Iron to the <hi>Griſtle</hi> or bottom of the Sore, whether the <hi>Probe</hi> reaches. Then with a <hi>Searing-Iron,</hi> much leſs than the former, pierce the Skin in ſeveral Parts round the Swelling, making the Holes an Inch diſtant from each other; but you muſt take great care not to touch the <hi>Cronet.</hi> All the Holes ought to pierce the Skin, and even a little deeper, which may be done without the leaſt danger, by reaſon of the Swelling. Having proceeded thus far, you muſt cover the whole burnt Part with an equal mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Tar,</hi> applying it hot with Flax, and binding a Clout over it very carefully, that your Horſe may not be able to bite it off. The Day after the Application let him Blood in the <hi>Neck-Vein,</hi> and let the firſt Dreſſing remain five or ſix Days, during which he will ſuffer a great deal of Pain. But if he be ſeiz'd with a Beating or Heaving in his Flank, give him at Night a good <hi>Clyſter,</hi> with about two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Polycreſt,</hi> and repeat the ſame next Morning, if there be occaſion. In the mean time you muſt feed him with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> mixt with <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> to the quantity of two Ounces every Day.</p>
                     <p>Some tender Horſes are ſeiz'd with a Fever, and a violent Palpitation in the Flanks, in which caſe you muſt adminiſter proper <hi>Clyſters.</hi> But ſince the Fever is only an effect of the Operation of the <hi>Cautery;</hi> as ſoon as that ceaſes it will alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</p>
                     <p>If he forſake his Meat (as many Horſes do) you muſt tie one of the <hi>Chewing-Balls,</hi> deſcrib'd in the Eighth Chapter, in a warm Clout, to the midſt of his Bit, letting him champ upon it two Hours in the Morning, and as long in the Afternoon. This Remedy will contribute effectually to the reſtoration of his Appetite.</p>
                     <p>The Scabs will be almoſt looſen'd from the burnt Parts, by the removal of the firſt Dreſſing, but the <hi>Cautery</hi> that ſticks to the <hi>Griſtle,</hi> will not quit its hold for a long time after, and therefore you muſt patiently attend its Operation. Nature will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſeparate the rotten from the ſound Part, and to expel that which is no longer a Part of the Body, as being depriv'd of Nouriſhment: If ſhe be vigorous, the Scab or Eſcar will quickly fall off; if not, you muſt give her time and liberty to act, without ſpurring her forwards: Only you muſt ſtill continue to apply the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Compoſition to the burnt Parts, renewing it every two Days till the Scabs be ſeparated; after which you muſt only waſh the Sores with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and cover 'em with Flax dipt in the ſame Liquor till they be perfectly heal'd.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Tents</hi> that were apply'd to the two ends of the <hi>Tendon,</hi> after they have done their work, and the Scabs are ſeparated, you muſt ſearch with the <hi>Probe,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Griſtle</hi> be not entirely extirpated, that you may not be afterwards oblig'd to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179659:288"/>apply a new <hi>Cautery,</hi> like that which you put in at firſt. Then dreſs the Sores with <hi>Schmit's Ointment</hi> till they be compleatly heal'd, burning the Proud Fleſh, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming it with Powders, as in the Cure of a <hi>Wound.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXIII. <hi>The</hi> Doctor's Ointment <hi>to cleanſe</hi> Quitter-bones.</head>
                     <p>MElt half a Pound of <hi>Tallow,</hi> and while 'tis very hot, add freſh <hi>Butter,</hi> and <hi>Oil of St. John's-wort,</hi> of each a quarter of a Pound, <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> three Ounces; then remove the Pot from the Fire, and when the Matter is half Cold, mix it with <hi>Borax</hi> and <hi>Realgar,</hi> both in fine Powder, of each two Ounces, Powder of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> three Ounces, continuing to ſtir till it be perfectly cold.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Ointment</hi> muſt be apply'd cold on Clouts or Tents; it cleanſes, dries, and heals, and without the aſſiſtance of any other Remedy, cloſes up Sores, made by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Cauſtics</hi> to the <hi>Cronet.</hi> But if there be any <hi>Felander,</hi> Scale of a <hi>Bone,</hi> or piece of the <hi>Griſtle</hi> to be ſeparated; you muſt ſtrew it with <hi>Sugar</hi> or <hi>White-Vitriol</hi> to it, and then apply the <hi>Ointment.</hi> If the part that ought to be ſeparated be ſmall, Sugar will ſuffice, but if it ſtick very faſt, you muſt make uſe of a Powder compos'd of two parts of <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> and one part of <hi>Sublimate</hi> exactly mixt together.</p>
                     <p>When there are any pieces of the Griſtle, Scales of Bones, or <hi>Felanders</hi> to be ſeparated, you muſt not imitate the Farriers, who, out of a pretended Tenderneſs, and for fear of hurting the Part, apply a digeſtive, which moiſtens and ſoftens it, whereas it ought to be dry'd, that the Scales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may fall away.</p>
                     <p>After the Scab or Eſcar is fall'n off, waſh the Sore, as often as you dreſs it, with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> or the above-mention'd <hi>Liquid-Cauſtic,</hi> which will keep it ſweet and clean; and if there be any Hole that pierces into the Hoof, or paſſes thro' the Foot, fill it with Tents beſmear'd with this Ointment. When you perceive no Matter at the bottom of the Sore, you may conclude, that there is nothing left which ought to be taken tway, and that your Horſe is in a hopeful way of Recovery; and when the Matter leaves off running altogether, 'tis a ſign that the Sore is heal'd.</p>
                     <p>If the Sore be on the outward Quarter, or out-ſide of the Foot, aſſoon as the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is ſound, and the Horſe begins to walk upright, 'tis better to make him tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, than to keep him ſtill in the Stable. Thus you may perceive, that I had reaſon to affirm, that the Sores on the outſide are more eaſily cur'd, than thoſe that are on the inſide of the Foot; and beſides, the Horſe cannot ſo readily fret or rub off the Skin of the griev'd Part with his contrary Foot.</p>
                     <p>If the Part be not dreſs'd with great care and diligence, the Fleſh frequently grows ſo faſt, that the Sore Place riſes higher than the Hoof, and the reſt of the <hi>Paſtern.</hi> This Inconvenience may be prevented by waſhing it every Day, either with the <hi>ſecond,</hi> or with the <hi>yellow Water,</hi> or (if you perceive that neither of theſe are ſufficient to curb the growth of the Fleſh) with the <hi>Liquid Cauſtic;</hi> and if that be ſtill too weak to put a ſtop to the growing Evil, you muſt cover it all over with Powder of <hi>Realgar,</hi> laying dry Flax over it, and binding a Cloth over all: Let the Dreſſing remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd eight and forty Hours; after which apply the Ointment <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> or <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum,</hi> or that deſcrib'd in this Chapter, to haſten the ſeparation of the Eſchar, which will ſtick ſeven or eight Days, and grow to the thickneſs of a Crown-Piece, leaving the Sore at laſt ſo ſweet and clean, that the Cure for the moſt part may be perfected, with the uſual drying Powders, ſuch as <hi>white Copperas,</hi> or ſome of thoſe which you will find deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CVIII. as calcin'd <hi>Tartar,</hi> or the like; and in this caſe the Horſe may travel without danger.</p>
                     <p>It happens not unfrequently, that after the Cure is ſeemingly compleated, the bottom appearing ſound, and no matter upon the Dreſſing, the Horſe begins to halt worſe than before; in which caſe, if there be no cavity or hollowneſs left, 'tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign that there is ſome corrupted piece of the <hi>Griſtle</hi> ſtill remaining, and that the Inciſion was not made far enough on the <hi>Cronet</hi> towards the <hi>Toe,</hi> to take in all the infected Part of the <hi>Tendon,</hi> and therefore you muſt repeat the whole Operation, opening a new Hole on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and proceeding as before; tho' all this trouble
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179659:288"/>might have been prevented at firſt, and the <hi>Griſtle</hi> wholly extirpated, by making the Inciſion an Inch further from the Hole of the Sore.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd that oftentimes tho' the <hi>Griſtle</hi> be wholly rooted out, and the Horſe ſeem perfectly ſound, the very next day he will halt right down, and the whole ſpace on the Toe between the <hi>Tendens</hi> will be ſeiz'd with a Swelling, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with a very conſiderable Heat. Theſe Diſorders are almoſt always occaſion'd by the neglect of thoſe who hold the Horſe's Foot when the <hi>Tendon</hi> is cut out; for if the Horſe be skittiſh or ſtubborn, they let go his Foot with a jerk, and the Hoof is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Violence of the Shock, becauſe the <hi>Griſtle</hi> that kept it firm is taken away. And therefore you ought always to make the Groom or him that holds the Foot, fall back two ſteps before he let go his hold, or ſuffer the Foot to touch the Ground.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as you perceive this Swelling, anoint it with <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> and bind it up with flax and a Cover, leaving it on eight and forty hours, to take away the Pain and Inflammation, which the Oil will do very effectually, if it be truly prepar'd, and not ſophiſticated. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two days are expir'd, draw Lines with a hot Iron from the Top to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Tumour, about a finger's breadth diſtant from each other, piercing thro' the Skin into the Hoof, for the Swelling preſerves the Parts from being ſpoil'd by the Fire. Anoint all the burnt Lines with <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> cold, applying Flax moiſten'd with the ſame Oil, and a Cloth over all; for if this Application be repeated three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it will take away the Pain occaſion'd by the Fire, and aſſwage the Swelling. This done, apply the Mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Tar,</hi> till the Scabs fall off, after which the Sores may be heal'd by waſhing 'em with <hi>Aqua-Vitae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Sore reaches far into the Foot, and the <hi>Tendon</hi> lies ſo deep under the Hoof, that it comes near the Sole, after the Cautery has done its Work, and the Scab is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, if your Horſe continue ſtill to halt, and even worſe than before the Cure was begun, you muſt immediately take out the Sole, if it was not taken out before, and ſearch the bottom of the Sore with your <hi>Probe.</hi> But there is ſomtimes ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (as for Example, an Inch, or Finger's breadth) between the Sole and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sore where the Probe ſtops, that you cannot without danger cut that Space to give a paſſage to the Matter downwards, and ſo promote the Cure by Injections and other proper Remedies, which perhaps may be neceſſary to ſeparate ſome Scale from the Bone of the Foot, that is always in ſome meaſure infected by the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the corrupted Griſtle, and muſt be exfoliated or ſcal'd, before the Cure can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And therefore in this Caſe you muſt cut away about two, three, or four fingers breadth of the Hoof from the top to the bottom, with a ſharp Knife red-hot, to unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Tendon, which muſt be cut out with the ſame red-hot Knife; after which dreſs the Sore every day, or once in two days, with <hi>Schmit</hi>'s <hi>Ointment,</hi> till it be heal'd, waſhing it always with a large quantity of <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> before you apply the Ointment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note;</hi> That you muſt never cut the Hoof quite thro' at the Corner of the Heel from the Cronet downwards; for as an Arch may turn'd to a Heap of Ruines by the removal of one Stone; ſo if the Natural Figure of the Foot be ſpoil'd, it remains uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or at leaſt cannot be reſtor'd without great Trouble and Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, for when the Hoof is cut to lay bare the Griſtle that lies very deep within the Foot, you will find very frequently or almoſt always, the Bone of the Foot corrupted by the Neighbourhood of the Tendon, and that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate a Scale, and ſometimes two Scales, from the infected Bone. In this Caſe there is no need of a <hi>corroſive Ointment,</hi> for the Bone may be exfoliated by the following Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Take <hi>Aloes</hi> and <hi>Myrrh,</hi> of each an Ounce, <hi>Sugar</hi> two Ounces; Mix and make a Powder: of which a ſufficient quantity being mix'd with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> muſt be aply'd to the Scale, and <hi>Schmit</hi>'s <hi>Ointment</hi> laid over it, till the Scale be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and the Horſe walk upright; after which the Sore may be heal'd like a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Wound.</p>
                     <p>'Tis frequently obſerv'd that about the End of the Cure, the Hoof ſhrinks under the Sore, and pinching the quick-Fleſh, makes the Horſe halt; in which Caſe you muſt pare away that part of the Hoof which bruiſes the Fleſh, and apply convenient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to dry the Fleſh. But this Inconveniency may be prevented, by moiſtening the Hoof with proper Ointments for the Feet.</p>
                     <p>The End of the Cure is not unfrequently the moſt difficult part of it: for uſually there remains a Sore on the <hi>Cronet</hi> which cannot be dry'd with Powders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt have recourſe to the following <hi>Ointment.</hi> I am not ignorant that Farriers endeavour always to dry up Sores with <hi>Powders,</hi> but that is a tedious, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179659:289"/>unſucceſsful Method, and therefore I adviſe you to perſiſt in the Uſe of <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to the End of the Cure.</p>

                           <hi>How to cure</hi> Quitter-bones, <hi>by</hi> giving the Fire.</head>
                        <p>I thought fit to give the precedency to <hi>Cauſtics,</hi> becauſe the Foot is not ſo much disfigur'd by thoſe Medicines, as by the <hi>Fire,</hi> which always ſpoils the Hoof. The moſt skilful Farriers are deterr'd by this conſideration from <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> in the Cure of theſe Sores; nevertheleſs, this is certainly a very effectual Method, and even requires leſs dexterity in the Undertaker, than that which is perform'd by <hi>Cauſtics.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since, as I intimated before, the Cure depends on the utter extirpation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Part of the <hi>Tendon,</hi> after you have ſearch'd the depth of the Sore with your <hi>Probe,</hi> you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> all over the Swelling, beginning above, and drawing the Lines very near each other to the Hoof under the <hi>Cronet,</hi> ſo deep as not only to pierce the Skin, but to reach and burn the <hi>Griſtle</hi> quite through, which lies deeper in ſome Horſes than in others: for if the red-hot Iron pierce only one half of the thickneſs of the <hi>Tendon,</hi> the Operation will prove wholly ineffectual. Then anoint the whole Sore with an <hi>Ointment</hi> compos'd of <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> and <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> or of <hi>Turpentine, Tar,</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> heated and mixt together, and apply'd hot with Flax, and a convenient Cover and Bandage to ſecure the whole Application from Slipping.</p>
                        <p>About five Days after unbind the Dreſſing, cleanſe and wipe the Sore, and renew the Application till the Scab fall quite away. This Operation is attended with ſo much Pain that the Horſe who endures it uſually forſakes his Meat, and is ſeiz'd with a Beating in his Flank: And therefore you muſt adminiſter <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> ſuch as were preſcrib'd to be us'd in the like caſe, when the Cure is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by <hi>Cauſtics.</hi> After the Scab is fall'n put your Probe into the Hole that reaches under the Hoof, and ſearch whether any part of the Griſtle be left. If you can find none, 'tis ſo much the better, for all your Task will be to dreſs the Sore with the <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> and waſh it once in two Days with the <hi>ſecond</hi> or the <hi>yellow Water.</hi> But ſince there remains almoſt always a Hole, you muſt put a Tent into it, beſmear'd with the ſame Ointment. And if you perceive no Matter on the end of the Tent, when you take it out, you may conclude, that the bottom of the Hole is ſound, and that the Cure will neither be tedious nor difficult, if you dreſs the Sore with the <hi>Ointment Apoſtolorum,</hi> or that of <hi>Schmit.</hi> But if, after all, the Horſe continue to halt right down, 'tis a certain ſign that the corrupted <hi>Tendon</hi> was not wholly extirpated; and therefore you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> again, to the very utmoſt borders of the Swelling towards the <hi>Cronet,</hi> piercing deeper than you did at firſt, with your <hi>Probe</hi> in your Hand to direct you, and applying the above-mention'd Compoſition hot, or the Ointment of <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> and <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> to the burnt Part, till the Scab or Eſcar be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                        <p>If your Horſe continue ſtill to halt conſiderably, and the Hole be deep, put in a Tent with the <hi>Ointment Apoſtolorum;</hi> and if it bring forth abundance of Matter, you may conclude, that the bottom of the Sore is corrupted, and that the root of all the Miſchief lies there: And therefore you muſt immediately proceed to the taking out of the <hi>Sole,</hi> if that was not done at the beginning. When you remove the Dreſſing of the Sole, thruſt your Probe into the Hole of the Sore ſomewhat ſtrongly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make it penetrate to the bottom of the Foot; and if you can perceive the Part under the Sole, that is oppoſite to the bottom of the Hole, pierce it quite thorow with a red-hot Iron, to open a free paſſage to the Matter, and put in a Tent beſmear'd with <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> mixt with Powder of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> which will hinder the Fleſh from growing too faſt on the <hi>Cronet.</hi> After the Scab is fall'n off, dreſs the Hole with the <hi>Doctors Ointment, Aegyptiacum,</hi> or the <hi>Ointment Apoſtolorum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:179659:289"/>
                        <p>If notwithſtanding all your care, ſome extraneous or preternatural Subſtance breed in the Hole, or get into it, ſuch as <hi>Felander,</hi> ſcale of the Foot-bone, or any thing elſe that ought not to be left in it, you muſt bring it forth by touching it with the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> and tenting the Hole with the <hi>Ointment Apoſtolorum;</hi> continue after the ſame manner for two or three Days together. If theſe Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not ſufficient to ſeparate the <hi>Felander</hi> ſpeedily, you muſt touch it with a Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Iron, then apply the Ointment, and the <hi>Felander</hi> will fall away, leaving the Horſe in a ſtate of Recovery.</p>
                        <p>The cutting or burning of the Piece between the bottom of the Sore and the <hi>Sole,</hi> ought not to be attempted in ſeveral Caſes; as, beſides ſome other Inſtances which might be alledg'd, when the ſpace that muſt be pierc'd is too thick, or when the Sore is too near the Bone call'd the <hi>Pivot,</hi> which governs the Foot; for ſince that Bone never ſcales, its foulneſs or corruption muſt be taken away by ſcraping, which is very troubleſome and painful, and weakens the Bone ſo much that it can hardly ever afterwards recover its former ſtrength. And therefore in ſuch caſes the beſt way is to pare away ſo much of the Hoof as to uncover the bottom of the Sore, that you may be able to burn the reſt of the <hi>Griſtle;</hi> and if there be any Scale or other Subſtance to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, you may proceed according to the former Directions.</p>
                        <p>When your Horſe begins to go upright, without any viſible halting, 'twill be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to dreſs the Sore, tho' never ſo large, with <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> ſpred on ſoft folds of Linnen; but before you apply the <hi>Ointment,</hi> if the Fleſh be foul you muſt touch it with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> or the <hi>Liquid Cauſtic,</hi> to allay the <hi>Itching,</hi> which is uſually ſo troubleſome, when the Sore begins to heal, that you can hardly keep the Horſe from nibbling at it with his Teeth.</p>
                        <p>You may alſo keep the Part from <hi>Itching,</hi> and the Fleſh from <hi>growing too faſt,</hi> by waſhing the Sore every Day (after the Scabs are fall'n off) with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> which is very effectual in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Sore muſt never be touch'd with common and unmix'd Water, becauſe it hinders the Cure, by encreaſing the Moiſture which abounds but too much already in the Parts near the Joints. For, to facilitate the motion of the Bones, provident Nature has fill'd the Joints with a certain Moiſture, that is eaſily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Neighbouring Parts; and therefore we muſt always endeavour to conſume that ſuperfluous Moiſture by drying Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Since the <hi>ſecond Water</hi> is of an excellent uſe, not only in this caſe, but for the Cure of all manner of Sores, I ſhall take this occaſion to inform the Reader, that this name is uſually given to <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> after it has been us'd for the ſolution of Metals, by which means it acquires a green colour. You may eaſily procure it from <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths</hi> or <hi>Refiners of Metals,</hi> who ſell it at a very low rate, as being unfit for their buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>When the Matter ceaſes to run out, tho' the Swelling be not wholly aſſwag'd, to dry up the remaining Sores, dreſs both theſe and the Swelling, once every two Days, with the <hi>ſecond Water</hi> boil'd to a moderate thickneſs with <hi>unſlack'd Lime,</hi> which will dry, bind, and reſolve very effectually, eſpecially if there be a Swelling, without any conſiderable Pain, nor can you make uſe of a better <hi>Aſtringent.</hi> The <hi>Lime</hi> muſt be laid in a dry place; where, in eight or ten Days, it will crumble into Powder.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Ring-bone</hi> is a Swelling that grows between the <hi>Cronet</hi> and <hi>Paſtern-Joint,</hi> on one of the two <hi>Tendons</hi> that are in that Part. 'Tis hard and callous, ſticking very faſt to the <hi>Paſtern;</hi> the Horſe does not complain much when you handle it: It preſſes the <hi>Tendons</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and grows ſo big when 'tis near the <hi>Cronet,</hi> that by intercepting the Nouriſhment, it makes the Foot ſhrink, and the Hoof wither or grow dry. The longer it continues, it deſcends lower upon the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing to a conſiderable bigneſs, makes the Horſe Lame; from whence 'tis plain,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179659:290"/>that the Greatneſs of the Danger which attends it muſt be meaſur'd by its Nearneſs to the <hi>Cronet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ring-bone</hi> is ſometimes hereditary; but 'tis uſually occaſion'd by a Strain taken in <hi>Curvetting,</hi> (which tries all the Force of the Sinews) <hi>bounding Turns,</hi> and violent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping or Races.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is not very common; but if the Danger be not prevented by a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Application of Remedies, 'tis uſually the Cauſe of irrecoverable Lameneſs. It proceeds ſometimes from the Indiſcretion of thoſe who back their Horſes while they are too Young, before their Joints are well knit and ſtrengthen'd.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes thoſe Tumors are at firſt no bigger than <hi>Beans,</hi> but afterwards they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to half the quantity of a ſmall <hi>Apple;</hi> and they uſually appear on both ſides the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> with a little Swelling between 'em. Since ſeveral Perſons are not only igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but afraid of the Effects of <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> they may obſerve the following Method.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place take out the Sole, then clip away the Hair very cloſe, and apply to the <hi>Ring-Bone</hi> true <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> with Flax, a Cover, and Bandage. Two days after ſeparate the Scurfs rais'd by the <hi>Oil,</hi> and renew the Application with the ſame Flax. When you take out the Sole you muſt cleave the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and when the Dreſſing is fitted to the Sole with Splents, you muſt thruſt Rowlers into the Cleft to keep it open, and one Bandage will ſerve both for the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> and <hi>Fruſh.</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> is the moſt uſual and certain Remedy to Cure <hi>Ring-Bones</hi> when they are increas'd to any conſiderable Bigneſs. Firſt, you muſt take out the Sole, and ſix days after, when you remove the ſecond Dreſſing, make Inciſions with your <hi>Fleam,</hi> beginning above, and reaching downwards, about a Finger's breadth diſtant from each other, cutting the Skin to the <hi>Callus</hi> that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>Ring-Bone</hi> thro' the whole Extent of the Swelling, but without hurting the <hi>Cronet.</hi> Since theſe Inciſions are uſually attended with a great Flux of Blood, apply hot <hi>Turpentine</hi> with Flax, and a Bandage, letting it remain untouch'd forty eight Hours; after which remove the Dreſſing, and with a red-hot, but not blazing Knife, burn the whole <hi>Callus</hi> very dexterouſly without preſſing too hard upon the Part. If the whole Subſtance of the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> be not conſum'd, your Labour will be entirely loſt; and therefore you muſt burn it over and over, and penetrate the whole Tumour thro' the Inciſions that were made before; after which apply a Mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Tarr,</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> or an Ointment made of <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> and <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> laying Flax over it, and wrapping it about with a Cloth till the Scabs fall away. Then dreſs the Sores with <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> or the Ointment <hi>Apoſtolorum,</hi> till the Matter ceaſe to flow; after which Farriers uſually waſh the Sores with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> and then apply drying Powders; in the mean time the Sores ought always to be kept cover'd, both to prevent the Growth of proud Fleſh, and to hinder the Horſe from reaching 'em with his Teeth: for if great Care be not taken to dreſs and cover the Part, there will remain a Swelling where the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> was, which may be reckon'd a great Deformity in the Leg, tho' it does not make the Horſe halt. Beſides you muſt be extremely care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Dreſſing of a <hi>Ring-bone,</hi> not to tye the Bandage too hard for fear of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an exceſſive Tumour: the beſt way is to renew the Dreſſing every day, or at leaſt every two days. I intend to make the <hi>Healing</hi> of the <hi>Sole</hi> after it is cut out, the Subject of a Particular Chapter, which you may conſult on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>I had once a Young Horſe committed to my Care for the Cure of this Diſtemper; and after I had taken out the <hi>Sole,</hi> and <hi>given the Fire,</hi> the <hi>Strangles,</hi> that were juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to run, tho' I cou'd not perceive any apparent Sign of 'em, fell with ſo much Violence on the Part where the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> was ſeated, which was on one of the Fore-Legs, that the whole Skank was extremely ſwoll'n, and the Tumour broke in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the <hi>Paſtern-Joint,</hi> out of which a vaſt quantity of Matter was evacuated. I kept the <hi>Cronet</hi> always charg'd with good <hi>Reſtringents</hi> made of Powder of <hi>unſlack'd Lime,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> to diſſolve the Swelling which reach'd that part, dreſſing the Sores with <hi>Aqua-Vitae, Honey,</hi> and <hi>unſlack'd Lime</hi> well mix'd together; and at laſt the Horſe recover'd, tho' the Cure was extremely retarded by that Accident.</p>
                     <p>Some affirm that a <hi>Ring-bone</hi> may be cur'd before it grow big, by <hi>giving the Fire</hi> without taking out the Sole, if the Foot be not very dry and ſhrunk, eſpecially if the Vein under the Knee be <hi>taken up;</hi> but Experience has convinc'd me, that to proceed methodically, the Cure of this Diſtemper muſt be always begun with taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> whether the <hi>Fire be given</hi> or not: for the taking out of the Sole draws the Matter downwards, and makes a kind of Revulſion; nor is the <hi>Fire</hi> alone, tho' <hi>given</hi> with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179659:290"/>all poſſible Care and Dexterity, able to diſſolve a <hi>Ring-bone.</hi> I have made ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations that will not permit me to doubt of this Truth; for I have ſeen ſome Horſes, who after an exact Obſervance of the above-mention'd Method, continu'd to halt as before: The Sole was taken out, the Skin was pierc'd with red-hot Knives, reaching to the very <hi>Callus,</hi> the whole Tumour was burnt, the Scabs fell, the Sores were fair, and in a very good Condition; and after all the Horſe was as Lame as ever. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oblig'd to order the <hi>Sole</hi> to be taken out a ſecond time, and the <hi>Fruſh</hi> to be cleft to the <hi>Paſtern</hi> with a Fleam, to widen the Heels, after which ſome of the Horſes were cur'd; tho' I have met with others that recover'd not till I had taken out the <hi>Sole</hi> a third time. At that time I had not found out the way of cleaving the <hi>Fruſh</hi> to widen the Heels, and therefore I only did half my work in taking out the Sole: But ſince I began to put that Method in Practice, I never was oblig'd to take out the Sole more than once. And to convince you of the Uſefulneſs of taking out the Sole in thoſe Caſes, I can aſſure you that I have cur'd Horſes of the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> by taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> without <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> applying <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> and proceeding according to the Directions mention'd in the Beginning of this Chapter; in ſo much that the Horſe went upright, and was very fit for Service, the <hi>Ring-bone</hi> in the mean time making no progreſs for above three Years; but at laſt it was found neceſſary to <hi>give the Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you cut the part with the Fleam, and then <hi>give the Fire</hi> thro' theſe Inciſions, the remaining Scar will be ſmaller and leſs unſeemly than if the Skin had been pierc'd with a red-hot Knife: for tho' in ſeveral other Caſes' the Skin is only ſear'd till it acquire a Cherry Colour, for the Cure of this Diſtemper you muſt not only pierce the Skin, but penetrate the whole Tumour or <hi>Callus,</hi> that ſticks to the <hi>Paſtern.</hi> However every Man may pleaſe himſelf, and either pierce the Skin with a red-hot Knife, or cut it with a Fleam, and then <hi>give the Fire</hi> thro' theſe Inciſions. 'Tis true indeed, the laſt of theſe Methods is the beſt, for beſides that it leaves not ſo great a Scar, theſe Inciſions ſerve to direct the Operator, and he ſees more plainly what he is doing than thoſe who pierce the Skin with red-hot Knives. Nevertheleſs I uſe with good Succeſs to proceed immediately to <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> and burning the <hi>Callus,</hi> without making the leaſt uſe of the Fleam, when the Horſe is of no great Value: aſſoon as the Fire is given, apply a Mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Tarr,</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> laying it on warm with Flax and a Bandage, and keeping the place cover'd till it be heal'd; after ſeven or eight days, when the Matter is generated, you muſt dreſs it every day. Sometimes after the falling of the Scab the Fleſh ſwells and grows too faſt; but this Inconveniency may be prevented, by waſhing the Sore with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> the <hi>vulnerary Water,</hi> or the <hi>liquid Cauſtic,</hi> and afterwards applying convenient Powders or Ointments, ſuch as that of <hi>Schmit,</hi> or the <hi>Cleanſing Ointment</hi> for <hi>Quitter-bones.</hi> While the Sole is growing under the Foot, you will ſeldom be troubl'd with proud Fleſh, and if you are, you may eaſily conſume it with Powders, or even burn it with a flat Knife; for provided you touch not the Skin, you may burn the Fleſh as much as you pleaſe, without the leaſt danger of leaving a Scar, and after the falling of the Scab, the Sore will appear fair and clean: but both the Growth of proud Fleſh may be prevented, and the Cure haſten'd, by keeping the Sore always cover'd with convenient Ointments.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXV. <hi>Of the Vices of the</hi> Feet <hi>and</hi> Hoofs.</head>
                     <p>IN the firſt place I ſhall take notice of thoſe Horſes who have pretty handſome Feet, but their Hoofs are ſo brittle, that they are apt to break near the Holes that are made by the Nails of their Shooes. And the Loſs of a Shooe, which uſually happens on this occaſion, may be the Cauſe of the Loſs of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hardneſs</hi> of the <hi>Hoof,</hi> if it be not accompany'd with <hi>Brittleneſs,</hi> may be eaſily cur'd; and is only a Defect by Accident. I ſhall in the ſecond Part treat of the <hi>Vices of the Feet</hi> with reſpect to the Figure and Shape, and of the <hi>Manner of Shooing</hi> adapted to every particular Caſe.</p>
                     <p>You may eaſily know at firſt ſight whether a Horſe's Hoofs be brittle, for they will appear all broken about the Shooe: the beſt way is to ſhooe thoſe Horſes after the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:179659:291"/>
                        <hi>Full Moon,</hi> and never during the <hi>Encreaſe,</hi> contrary to the Opinion of ſeveral Perſons; after which you muſt anoint 'em every Day with the <hi>Ointment for the Feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second Part</hi> I ſhall diſcourſe largely of Feet that are ill-ſhap'd, flat, and form'd like Oyſter-ſhells; but ſince I have reaſon to believe, that many of my Readers will not have the Curioſity to peruſe thoſe Chapters, it will not be improper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on that Subject here.</p>
                     <p>By the following Method you may rectifie a <hi>flat</hi> Hoof, which is commonly ſo weak, that the Horſe cannot Travel unleſs his Shoes be made very hollow, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the leaſt Sand or Gravel that enters between the Shoe and the Sole, makes him ſo Lame that he muſt be kept on the Trench for ſome time after. In the firſt place, you muſt <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Paſtern Veins</hi> in four ſeveral places, two in each Leg: Or you may bleed him plentifully in the four <hi>Paſtern Veins,</hi> and delay the <hi>taking</hi> of 'em <hi>up</hi> till afterwards, then ſet on <hi>Pantoſle</hi> Shoes to widen the Heels; for almoſt all thoſe flat Feet have narrow Heels. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that you muſt by no means weaken the Sole towards the Heel, when you pare the Hoof, but leave it as ſtrong as you can; for otherwiſe theſe Shoes will certainly make the Horſe halt: You muſt alſo ſuffer him to reſt ſome Days after the Shoes are ſet on, and keep his Feet in his own Dung well moiſten'd, that he may be enabl'd by the Moiſture to wear theſe Shoes without any inconvenience. Beſides, you muſt not open the Heels, but pare the <hi>Fruſh</hi> flat, for otherwiſe the Sponge on one ſide wou'd bear too hard againſt the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Sponges</hi> of theſe Shoes muſt not be made wide. If theſe Directions be obſerv'd, the Shoes will bear very little againſt the <hi>Fruſh;</hi> and tho' they ſometimes preſs the Sole, there can be no danger ſince both that and the <hi>Fruſh</hi> are left very ſtrong. Having Shoo'd the Horſe thus, greaſe the top of the Foot, near the Hair every Day, and you will perceive it by degrees to acquire a more regular ſhape; after which you may <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Paſtern Veins,</hi> as I intimated before: For if the bleeding produce a good effect, the <hi>taking up</hi> of the Veins will certainly compleat the Cure; and in three or four Months your Horſe will be able to wear flat Shoes, and by degrees his Foot will recover its perfect ſhape.</p>
                     <p>You will find the Reaſon of this Operation in the <hi>Chapter</hi> that contains directions for the Shooing of <hi>flat Feet:</hi> But ſince the following <hi>Ointment</hi> is neceſſary in this caſe, I ſhall take this occaſion to communicate the deſcription of it.</p>

                           <hi>The</hi> Ointment of Plantane, <hi>otherwiſe call'd the</hi> Ointment for the Feet, <hi>to Rectifie the</hi> Hoof, <hi>and make it grow.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take freſh <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Sheep's Suet,</hi> melted and freed from its Membrances, of each one Pound, <hi>White-Wax</hi> cut into ſmall Pieces, and <hi>Common Turpentine,</hi> of each four Ounces, <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> ſix Ounces, put 'em altogether into a Baſon, and melt 'em: Then add a Pint of <hi>Juice of Plantane,</hi> and as ſoon as you perceive 'em begin to boil, remove the Veſſel from the Fire, then ſet it on again, and continue after the ſame manner for the ſpace of eight or ten Hours till the Juice be wholly Conſum'd without boiling; after which remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and as ſoon as the Matter begins to thicken add an Ounce of <hi>Olibanum</hi> in Powder, ſtirring perpetually till it be quite Cold. This <hi>Ointment</hi> rectifies the Hoof, and makes it grow without occaſioning a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat, which is the uſual effect of <hi>uncorrected Oils</hi> and <hi>Greaſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Juice of Plantane</hi> tempers the heat of the other Ingredients, and therefore you muſt avoid boiling, which wou'd conſume it before it had time to communicate its cooling quickly. In Winter you may apply an <hi>Ointment</hi> made of equal Parts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Honey, Tar,</hi> and <hi>Tallow,</hi> mixt without heat or boiling; for 'tis a very effectual and cheap Remedy.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>Of all thoſe who pretend to Skill in this Art, there is not one who has not the Vanity to boaſt of ſome <hi>Secret Ointment for the Feet:</hi> And even ſome of our Farriers have the confidence to affirm, that their Ointment is abſolutely incomparable, and able to make a Hoof grow an Inch bigger in Eight Days; but that never was, nor ever will be done; for beſides the efficacy of the Remedy, the growth of the Hoof depends on
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179659:291"/>the Seaſon, the drineſs or moiſture of the Horſe's Conſtitution, and the nature of the Foot. I muſt confeſs I dare not promiſe Wonders; but I can aſſure the Reader that the Compoſition of this <hi>Ointment</hi> is methodical, that the Ingredients are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of the Hoof, that their Doſes are exact and regular, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that if we may venture to eſtabliſh the credit of a Remedy upon Theoretical Principles, this muſt certainly be endu'd with excellent Virtues, but that is not all, for I have found it by experience to be very ſucceſsful; and Monſieur <hi>Le Conneſtable,</hi> who had the fineſt ſet of Horſes that cou'd be procur'd in his Age, made always uſe of this Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Take new <hi>Wax, Goat's-greaſe,</hi> or for want of that, freſh <hi>Sheep's-Suet,</hi> and the fat of <hi>Bacon</hi> cut into ſmall Pieces, and ſteep'd in Water twenty four Hours till it grow freſh, the Water being chang'd every three or four Hours, of each one Pound: Melt 'em together, and then add a large handful of the ſecond Bark of <hi>Elder;</hi> and if it be in the Spring, two handfuls of <hi>Elder-Buds,</hi> when they are about the bigneſs of your Thumb. Boil 'em over a gentle Fire for the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour, ſtirring 'em from <hi>time</hi> to <hi>time.</hi> Then ſqueeze the Matter thro' a courſe Cloth, and put the ſtraining in the ſame Baſon or Pot, with two Ounces of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> four Ounces of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and the like quantity of <hi>Honey;</hi> after which remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and ſtir the <hi>Ointment</hi> till it be quite Cold, then anoint the Hoof for the breadth of an Inch round the Hair, and repeat the Application once a day.</p>
                        <p>You muſt never anoint the Foot but when 'tis dry, and you muſt always take care to wipe off the Duſt and dry Dirt before you lay on the Ointment.</p>
                        <p>All Books of Horſemanſhip are full of deſcriptions of <hi>Ointments for the Feet;</hi> and even every Farrier uſually compoſes his own. I might imitate their Example, and ſwell my Book to as little purpoſe as they do theirs, but I am not ſo fond of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Medicines, eſpecially ſince I'm encourag'd by often repeated and ſucceſsful Experiments to ſtick to the three Ointments mention'd in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> namely, The <hi>Ointment of Plantane,</hi> that of <hi>Conneſtable,</hi> and the other compos'd of equal quantities of <hi>Honey, Tar,</hi> and <hi>Greaſe.</hi> The firſt is chiefly uſeful when the Hoof is as hard as Glaſs, ſo that the Ointments that are apply'd to it glide along without piercing it; and the ſecond and third are proper in all other caſes. The laſt is cheap, and more effectual than all thoſe coſtly and elaborate Medicines that are uſually preſcrib'd for the Feet. 'Tis to be obſerv'd that <hi>Spetch Greaſe</hi> muſt never enter the Compoſition of Ointments for the Feet, by reaſon of its heat, which will make the Foot ragged and full of Circles.</p>

                        <p>Having ſpoken of the Vices and Imperfections of the Feet, 'twill not be improper to ſubjoin the method of making the Hoof grow; ſince it happens not unfrequently that a Horſe who has Travell'd without Shooes till his Feet be worn and decay'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uſeleſs ever afterwards, for want of a ſufficient hold for the Nails that muſt be driven into his Hoofs. Inſtead of obſerving the uſual Cuſtom to anoint the Hoof every Day for the breadth of an Inch about the <hi>Cronet</hi> next the Hair, you muſt ſpread the Ointment on Flax, wrap it about the Hoof for the breadth of an Inch round the <hi>Cronet</hi> at the Hair, and bind it on carefully, renewing the Application twice a Week, but keeping ſtill the ſame Flax that was apply'd at firſt. This Method is more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al than that which is commonly practis'd, for the Ointment being kept conſtantly on the Hoof, will moiſten and penetrate it, and conſequently make it grow. You may apply any of the three above-mention'd Ointments according to the Nature of the Hoof.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXVI. <hi>Of</hi> Surbated Feet.</head>
                     <p>A Horſe's Foot is ſaid to be <hi>Surbated,</hi> when the Sole is worn, bruis'd or ſpoil'd, which happens either when 'tis too dry, and in a manner depriv'd of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; or when an unſhod Horſe is ridden on hard Ground, or when the Shoe hurts the Sole. You may eaſily know whether a Horſe be <hi>Surbated</hi> by unſhooing him;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179659:292"/>for that part of the Shooe which touches the <hi>ſurbated</hi> place will be thinner and more worn than the reſt of it.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe may be alſo <hi>ſurbated</hi> by a Prick in his Foot with a Nail, if it be not quickly heal'd; for the Sole is ſeiz'd with a violent Heat and Pain, which draws the Matter to the Part. A <hi>Bleime</hi> may alſo occaſion the ſame Diſorder; And even a Horſe may be <hi>ſurbated</hi> that never ſtirs out of the Stable, unleſs when he goes to the <hi>Manage,</hi> where by reaſon of the ſoftneſs of the Ground 'tis hardly conceivable that he can be <hi>ſurbated,</hi> eſpecially ſince his Feet are defended with good Shooes. You may alſo bring this Infirmity upon your Horſe, by riding him into the Country, tho' you take care to keep him well ſhod; for the Foot being too dry, bruiſes, cruſhes, and corrupts the Fleſh, between the Bone of the Foot and the Sole, ſo that the Horſe halts right down, and receives not any conſiderable Benefit by all the Remedies that can be apply'd. The beſt way in this Caſe is to take out the Sole, to diſcover the Fleſh which you will find black and bruis'd, and afterwards proceed to the Application of the uſual Remedies which will infallibly prove ſucceſsful. But ſince there are other Cauſes of <hi>ſurbating,</hi> you may try what can be done by a careful Obſervance of the following Directions, before you take out the Sole.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe that has weak Feet is ridden in ſandy Ground in the <hi>Dog-Days,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hot Weather, his Feet are ſo heated that the Sole grows perfectly dry, and bruiſes the Bone of the Foot, ſo that the Horſe is hardly able to ſtand upright; for the Fleſh between the Bone of the Foot and the Sole being bruis'd occaſions a moſt violent Pain. You may eaſily know when a Horſe is <hi>ſurbated,</hi> becauſe you may perceive the Sole to be hot, dry, and painful, and the Horſe tho' troubl'd with no other Diſtemper, will covet to lie down rather than to eat. The Remedy commonly us'd by Farriers, is to <hi>take out the Sole</hi> of the <hi>ſurbated</hi> Foot; This is certainly the ſureſt Method of Cure; but ſince 'tis tedious, and dreaded by moſt Maſters of Horſes, there are other Remedies which ought to be try'd before it. I ſhall ſubjoin an Account of ſome of 'em, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſuch that are moſt eaſie.</p>

                        <p>When the <hi>ſurbating</hi> is occaſion'd by Travelling without Shooes, you muſt cleanſe the Sole with your <hi>Buttreſs;</hi> and having tack'd on the Shooe with four Nails, pour boiling <hi>Pitch</hi> or <hi>Tarr</hi> into the Foot, and after 'tis cold, charge it with the following <hi>Remolade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take a Pound of old <hi>Hog's Lard,</hi> or for want of that, of <hi>Tallow,</hi> melt it in a Skillet, add a Pint of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and thickening the Compoſition with <hi>Bran,</hi> apply it hot about the Foot, wrapping it about with a Cloth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Remolade</hi> deſcrib'd in the <hi>Fifty ſeventh</hi> Chapter, is excellent for <hi>ſurbated</hi> Feet; you muſt firſt heat it, then having pick'd the Sole, ſtop the Foot with the <hi>Remolade;</hi> or you may pour melted <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> into the Foot.</p>
                        <p>If the Shooe bear harder againſt one part of the Foot than the reſt, you muſt pare the whole Foot a little, but eſpecially that part which is bruis'd by the Shooe; and if the Sole appears red and bruis'd, you muſt thruſt your Buttreſs deeper into that part, and pare the Sole almoſt to the quick: then apply the <hi>Ointment</hi> for <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail,</hi> or the <hi>Oil of Gabian,</hi> or <hi>de Merveille,</hi> and tack on the Shooe with four Nails. Renew the Application every day till your Horſe ceaſe to halt, and then ſtop his Foot with a <hi>Remolade,</hi> binding it on carefully. You may uſe that which follows.</p>
                        <p>Fry <hi>Pigg's Dung</hi> with <hi>Oil of Nuts,</hi> and put it warm into the Foot, laying Splints over it to keep it in; the next day renew the Application of the <hi>Ointment</hi> or <hi>Oil de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veille,</hi> and the <hi>Remolade,</hi> and continue after the ſame manner till your Horſe leave off halting, and then ſtop his Foot with <hi>Tarr,</hi> when the Shooe is ſet on for Travelling.</p>
                        <p>If your Horſe's Foot be heated by riding in hot and ſandy Ground, you muſt take off his Shooe, pick his Foot well, and then ſtop it with melted <hi>Tarr,</hi> and anoint it with the <hi>Ointment for the Foot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nothing aſſwages the Pain of <hi>ſurbated</hi> Feet more effectually than <hi>Vinegar,</hi> boil'd with <hi>Soot</hi> to the Thickneſs of Broth, and put into the Foot boiling hot, laying Hurds over it, and Splints to keep it from falling out.</p>
                        <p>If you dreſs him thus once every day, Two or Three Applications will probably perfect the Cure.</p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:179659:292"/>
                        <p>There cannot be more excellent Remedy than <hi>Tar,</hi> for if it be melted into the Foot, it aſſwages the Pain, and ſtrengthens the Part with wonderful efficacy.</p>
                        <p>It may be eaſily procur'd at <hi>Sea-Ports</hi> and other Places where Ships are built or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted, and may be made upon occaſion by melting a Pound of <hi>Black Pitch,</hi> with half a Pound of the thickeſt Dregs of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> or for want of that of very old ſtinking <hi>Hogs-greaſe.</hi> This is that with which the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Carriers anoint the Axle-Trees of their Carts and Waggons.</p>
                        <p>If all theſe Remedies produce no effect, and the Heat and Pain ſeem daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, you muſt at laſt take out the Sole: And in the mean time 'twill perhaps be ſome Comfort to you to know, that notwithſtanding the bad Succeſs of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they are not entirely loſt; for the Sole being moiſten'd may be taken out with leſs Difficulty and Pain, and the Cure will be conſiderably haſten'd: Nor will ever any Farrier that underſtands the Art he Profeſſes, attempt to take out a Horſe's Sole till he has firſt ſoften'd his Foot with good <hi>Remolades</hi> or <hi>Honey-Charges,</hi> or at leaſt with old <hi>Hog's-Lard.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXVII. <hi>Of a</hi> Falſe Quarter.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Falſe Quarter</hi> is a Chink or Rift in the Hoof from top to bottom, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens almoſt always on the inſide of the Hoof, as being the weakeſt Part; it proceeds uſually from the drineſs of the Hoof which ſtraightens the Heels, or at leaſt breeds Circles about the Feet; ſo that the Bone of the Boot, for want of room, burſts the Hoof in the inward Quarter, which is the feebleſt part of it.</p>
                     <p>This Infirmity in the Hoof is uſually occaſion'd when a Horſe that has too narrow Heels, or a dry Foot, is ridden in hard, hot, or ſandy Ground, or in great Froſts. Sometimes the Hoof is crack'd in the Stable, without any other Cauſe than its own drineſs and brittleneſs. This, in my Opinion, is one of the moſt dangerous Diſtempers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to a Horſe; for the Pain makes him lame and unfit for Service. When he ſets his Foot to the Ground, the Chink is open'd and gapes, and when he lifts it up again the lips of the Rift are clos'd and pinch the Fleſh that covers the Bone of the Foot within the Hoof; in the mean time, ſince the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> or <hi>Membrane</hi> that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the Bone, is very tender, and of a quick Senſe; theſe Chinks are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a moſt violent Pain, and for the moſt part caſt forth Blood.</p>
                     <p>You may reaſonably conclude, when you perceive that a Horſe is troubl'd with a <hi>Falſe Quarter,</hi> that he has naturally a bad Hoof; for that Diſtemper is only the effect of a dry and brittle Hoof, or narrow Heels; and beſides, after the Cure is perfected, if you have not a perpectual Care of his Preſervation, he will infallibly relapſe into the ſame Diſtemper. Sometimes the Hoof of the hinder Foot cleaves from the Hair to the Shooe in the middle of the Toe; and the Feet that are cleft after this manner are called <hi>Oxes-Feet,</hi> becauſe of their reſemblance to the Foot of that Animal. This Diſeaſe is not ſo dangerous as the former, and happens more uſually to <hi>Mules</hi> than to <hi>Horſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe Cracks you muſt ſupple the Sole with <hi>Horſes-Dung,</hi> moiſten'd; you muſt alſo take care not to ſtraiten his Heels when you Shoe him, and anoint the Coffin-bone with the <hi>Ointment for the Feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cows-Dung,</hi> contrary to the vulgar Opinion, eſpecially of <hi>Horſe-Courſers,</hi> cools and moiſtens the Sole, and at the ſame time dries the Hoof, or rather burns it; For tho' the <hi>Hoof</hi> and <hi>Sole</hi> be contiguous, they are of very different Natures, one being ſoft and the other hard. Thus we ſee that moſt of the Coach-Horſes that are Sold by Horſe-Courſers, have dry and burnt Feet, by reaſon of the <hi>Cows-Dung,</hi> with which they continually ſtop their Horſe's Feet to make 'em grow: And when a Horſe comes afterwards to be Wrought, all the lower part of the Foot which was kept continually in <hi>Cow's-Dung,</hi> breaks off, and leaves the Horſe unfit for Service. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the moiſture of the <hi>Cow's-Dung</hi> makes the Hoof grow; but 'tis no leſs certain that the Hoof produc'd or encreas'd by this Method is not at all fit for Service; for aſſoon as 'tis taken out of the Dung in which 'twas kept; it breaks like an Egg-ſhell, and can never endure the driving of a Nail. 'Tis true, the <hi>Horſe-Courſers</hi> by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179659:293"/>this means compaſs their Deſign; for ſince they intend not to keep the Horſe for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they labour only to make his Feet ſeem fine and handſome, tho' to the prejudice of the Buyer.</p>

                           <hi>A Remedy for a</hi> Falſe Quarter, <hi>and</hi> Chinks <hi>or</hi> Rifts <hi>in the</hi> Hoof.</head>
                        <p>Charge the whole Foot with a <hi>Remolade;</hi> then ſet on a <hi>Pantofle-Shoe</hi> according to the Directions you will find in the <hi>Second Part,</hi> in the <hi>Chapter</hi> that treats of <hi>Shooing;</hi> and in the mean time you may ride your Horſe on ſoft Ground, if he be not Lame.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Chink</hi> bleed, charge the Foot with a <hi>Remolade,</hi> and opening the Cleft with your drawing Iron, make a Border about it with <hi>Yellow Wax,</hi> and drop ſome <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> into it; the Border of Wax will hinder the <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> from reaching the Hoof, and penetrating thro' the <hi>Crack</hi> will burn the quick Fleſh or Membrane that occaſions the Pain and Bleeding. This Water has a corroding and conſuming Faculty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently makes the Part to which 'tis applied inſenſible, which is the main thing requir'd in the preſent caſe; but if the <hi>Rift</hi> do not bleed 'tis not abſolutely neceſſary to pour in <hi>Aqua-Fortis.</hi> For you may make <hi>S's of Fire,</hi> according to the following Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and after the application of the <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> you may make an <hi>S of Fire</hi> on the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, without piercing the Skin, and another lower down. The <hi>S of Fire</hi> is made with an Iron Inſtrument reſembling the Letter <hi>S,</hi> which muſt be heated and applied exactly to the Cronet where the Hoof begins: Another Iron muſt be applied lower down upon the Crack, and another after that; then ſuffer the Scab to fall off from the Cronet, and the Cure will be quickly perfected, if you take care to keep the Foot ſupple with <hi>Horſe's-Dung,</hi> well moiſten'd, or a good <hi>Remolade.</hi> This Inſtrument is very thin, and but a Finger's breadth long: 'Tis framed like one of thoſe Irons with which Casks are uſually mark'd, and has a handle after the ſame faſhion. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Skin on the Cronet muſt not be pierc'd when you apply the <hi>S;</hi> for the Fleſh would riſe ſo high, that the Swelling could not eaſily be aſſwag'd. The Rift being clos'd about an Inch under the Hair, you muſt ſet on the Horſe's-Shoe, and ſo turn and contrive it, that the <hi>Falſe Quarter</hi> may be open'd, and that ſide of the Hoof forc'd outwards; after which you may ride him on ſoft Ground, but you muſt carefully avoid hard and ſtony Places. The Method of Shooing Horſes that are troubl'd with this Diſtemper, is deſcrib'd in the Forty Firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Second Part;</hi> and you may alſo ſet on a <hi>Pantofle</hi>-Shoe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Manag'd</hi> Horſes that are not carefully kept are ſubject to this Diſtemper, by reaſon of the drineſs of the Hoof, or ill Shooing; to remedy which inconveniency, the uſual way is to cut the Shooe at the Place where it touches the Rift, and theſe Shoes are called <hi>Lunet</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi>-Shoes.</p>
                        <p>When a Horſe wears his Shoes cut on both ſides, that is, when both the Sponges are taken away, you muſt ſuffer him to ſtay in the Stable till his Feet gather ſtrength; and aſſoon as he ceaſes to halt, you may ride him as before, but only on ſoft Ground.</p>
                        <p>I have already order'd an <hi>S of Fire</hi> to be made when the Crack bleeds. The ſame Remedy may be us'd for all ſorts of <hi>Falſe Quarters,</hi> obſerving always that the Skin on the <hi>Cronet</hi> muſt not be pierc'd, and even that the <hi>S of Fire</hi> muſt never be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the <hi>Cronet,</hi> unleſs your conveniency will permit you to ſuffer the Horſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Stable till the Scab be fall'n, and the Sore heal'd, tho' this is the only way to prevent effectually the return of the Diſtemper. If the Cleft be ſmall, and do not make the Horſe halt, you need not apply the <hi>S of Fire</hi> to the <hi>Cronet;</hi> but for the greater ſecurity, you may apply it to the place where the <hi>Cronet</hi> ends, and in two or three places along the Rift, for they cloſe and reunite the gaping ſides of the Crack, and contribute very much to the Cure. As ſoon as you have <hi>given the Fire</hi> take a head of <hi>Garlick,</hi> and having prick'd it with an Iron, Infuſe it in boiling <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> then rub the Chink with it from one end to the other, dipping it often in the hot Oil, that the Chink may be throughly moiſten'd. After two or three Days you may begin to ride your Horſe, if he be freed from his Lameneſs; and the <hi>Falſe Quarter</hi> will be afterwards heal'd, if you take care to keep the Foot moiſt and ſupple.</p>
                        <p>The beſt way to preſerve the Feet of <hi>Manag'd</hi> Horſes is to beat down their Heels almoſt to the Quick, but without opening 'em, as often as you ſet on a Shooe, and to take all poſſible care to prevent their growing high-heel'd. You muſt alſo anoint
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179659:293"/>Feet, and ſtop 'em with <hi>Horſe's-Dung</hi> well moiſten'd, twice or thrice every Week. I'm perſwaded that if this Method were generally us'd (as 'tis by ſome, with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Succeſs) this Diſtemper would never appear in our Stables; whereas, for want of a due obſervance of this Caution, almoſt all Horſes are troubl'd with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place you muſt pare the Foot, ſo that the Shooe do not touch the Hoof for the ſpace of an Inch about the Chink; and remember afterwards to anoint the Foot from time to time.</p>
                        <p>If your Horſe continue to halt, and the Rift remains ſtill open, and apt to be fill'd with Dirt or Gravel, you may <hi>give the Fire,</hi> drawing four Strokes or Lines on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> without touching the <hi>Hoof</hi> or <hi>Coffin-Bone,</hi> and without piercing the Skin; then apply <hi>Black-Pitch</hi> melted, with a Penſil, laying over it ſhavings of Cloth, or ſtuffings of a Saddle, till the Scab fall; and in the mean time charge the Foot with a good <hi>Remolade,</hi> or with <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Honey</hi> mixt and heated together; and after the Scab is fall'n off, dry the Part with <hi>burnt Allom,</hi> or ſome other convenient Powder, keeping the Foot always moiſten'd, with the <hi>Ointment for the Feet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Foot is cleft in the middle like an <hi>Oxe's-Foot,</hi> heat a Bodkin or crooked Aul, and thruſt it thro' the thickneſs of the Hoof, then put a thread of Copper Wire thro' the Hole, and faſten it with Pincers. Repeat the ſame Operation in two or three places according to the length of the Foot, drawing the ſides of the Clift to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but the Wire muſt not penetrate into the Foot, but only into the thickneſs of the Hoof. And either after or before this Operation, you muſt draw three or four Lines with a red-hot Iron upon the <hi>Cronet,</hi> length-wiſe, without piercing the Skin, applying <hi>Black-Pitch</hi> and Saddle-ſtuffings before, and drying the Part after the Scab is fallen off. Then you may ride your Horſe or Mare as formerly, for after the Sore on the <hi>Cronet</hi> is heal'd, the Cleft wears away by degrees if you take care to keep the Foot moiſt. This Method is certainly very effectual, but you muſt carefully examine the thickneſs of the <hi>Coffin-Bone,</hi> that you may neither pierce too deep, nor take too little hold of the Hoof.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not be afraid of this Operation, for 'tis not at all dangerous, ſince by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Hoof which amounts to half a Finger's breadth, you may thruſt in the hot Bodkin or Aul to a conſiderable depth, without piercing to the Quick. This Method is commonly us'd in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe who cannot be perſwaded of the ſafeneſs of this Operation may uſe a piece of Iron made very narrow, with two Points riſing upwards, and ſharpend like Nails for a Horſe-Shooe. This Iron may be plac'd under the Foot, to keep it cloſe, and prevent the widening of the Cleft, and the two Points may be faſten'd to the Hoof, or even rivetted on. That you may the more eaſily comprehend my Meaning, you muſt know that the piece of Iron muſt be put under the Foot, and clench'd or rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the two ends, as if it were deſign'd to hinder a board from cleaving. It muſt be applied to the Hoof without touching the Sole, and may be fram'd exactly like the Iron that hinders the Latch of a Door from riſing too high, or falling too low, but it ought to be a great deal ſmaller and thinner, for there is no more ſtrength nor thickneſs requir'd than what is juſt neceſſary to keep the Foot cloſe, and prevent the further widening of the Cleft. This is an excellent Invention, and has perfectly cur'd ſeveral Horſes that were downright Lame, and unfit for all manner of Service, by reaſon of thoſe Clefts reſembling an <hi>Oxe's-Hoof.</hi> After the piece of Iron is apply'd, and exactly fitted to the Hoof, you muſt ſet on the Shooe above it; for tho' your Horſe may complain for ſome Days after he is new-Shod, he will go upright, if you ſuffer him to reſt two Days.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the Fore-Foot cleaves in the middle of the Toe, in which caſe you muſt take care in ſetting on the Shooe, that it may neither touch the Cleft nor the Hoof about it; and beſides you muſt anoint the Foot. You may alſo draw two or three Lines with a hot Iron above upon the <hi>Cronet,</hi> without piercing the Skin, laying a Plaiſter over it, and covering it with Hurds or Saddle-ſtuffings; then ſuffer the Scab to fall off, and dry the Sore with convenient <hi>Powders</hi> or <hi>Ointments.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. LXXXVIII. <hi>Of</hi> Narrow Heels.</head>
                     <p>THE Horſes that are troubl'd with this Diſtemper, which is uſually attended with Lameneſs, have their Fruſh almoſt always too narrow, and the Quarters of the Foot are narrower near the Shooe than towards the <hi>Cronet;</hi> ſo that for want of the due roundneſs, and out-bowing of the Foot, the Bone within is ſtreightn'd, and the Fleſh that ſurrounds it bruis'd, which occaſions the Horſe's Lameneſs.</p>
                     <p>There is no roundneſs about the Heels, and the Feet ſeem rather ſharp-pointed and long, than round as they ought to be; for thoſe Horſes who have the roundeſt Heels are leaſt ſubject to this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this Infirmity affects only one quarter of the Foot, and almoſt always on the Inſide, which is weaker than the other, becauſe the Hoof is thinner there than on the outſide; if the Diſeaſe appear on both Quarters, the Cure will be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, tho' the Lameneſs may be as great when only one of the Quarters ſuffer by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the Heel.</p>
                     <p>This Infirmity may be occaſion'd by ill Shooing, as it may be cur'd by ſetting on the Shooe with due caution, according to the directions laid down in the Chapter of <hi>Shooing;</hi> it may alſo proceed from the drineſs of the Foot, when the ſubſtance of the Hoof is ſpoil'd, and full of Wrinkles; and ſometimes it is an effect of the Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs or unskilfulneſs of thoſe who either open the Heels or ſuffer them to grow too much, and weaken the Quarters of the Foot, by pairing then too deep.</p>
                     <p>Fleet and Light Horſes are more ſubject to this Infirmity than ſtrong <hi>German</hi> Horſes; and therefore <hi>Turkiſh, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Barbary</hi> Horſes ought to be ſhod with great Care, and an exact obſervance of the beſt Rules; nor muſt you intruſt the Shooing of theſe Horſes to common Smiths or Farriers, if they be not very Skilful in their Profeſſion, which is a Character that belongs to a very ſmall number of them.</p>
                     <p>Yet there are ſome fine Horſes who have ſuch excellent Feet, and ſo tough Hoofs, that the unskilfulneſs of the Farrier can never be attended with ſuch dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, but great care muſt be taken in Shooing <hi>German, Race,</hi> and <hi>Coach-Horſes,</hi> who are ſubject to this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive that the <hi>Pantofle-Shoes,</hi> and the Remedies preſcrib'd for the Cure of the Diſtemper, are not attended with the deſir'd Succeſs, you muſt proceed to the taking out of the Sole, which is the laſt, and oftentimes the beſt and ſpeedieſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Aſſoon as you have unſol'd him, cleave the Fruſh with your <hi>Fleam,</hi> and fit a Splent of Iron to the Part, placing it ſo that it may open the Heels, or rather keep them open, an Inch or two wider than they were before the Sole was taken out. The Heels are open'd by the Splent becauſe the Fruſh being cleft or divided, yields or opens in the middle; and I have ſometimes caus'd Horſes to be unſol'd who had ſo narrow Heels that we were forc'd to open the Hoof at the Heels, and afterwards fit a Splent to the Part, thruſting it in violently that it might keep the Heels much widen'd. After you have taken out the Sole, lay on the Dreſſing about the Foot to moiſten it, and make the Sole grow again, keeping on the Iron Splent all the while; and after the Sole is grown, you will find the Heel widen'd and reduc'd to its former and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſhape; for this Infirmity is rarely a natural Defect, but occaſion'd either by ſome accident or ill Shooing, or proceeds from the drineſs of the Foot, and for want of its being kept moiſt with convenient Ointments.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is troubl'd with this Infirmity in an Academy, the uſual Remedy is to ſet on <hi>Moon Shooes;</hi> And it muſt be acknowledg'd that this Method is uſeful; but beſides that, I have oftentimes, with very good Succeſs, <hi>given the Fire</hi> from the Hair to the Shooe, ſearing five or ſix Lines piercing the Hoof about the thickneſs of a ſilver Crown, and repeating the ſame Operation on the other ſide of the Heel, which inſtantly ſoftens the Hoof, and makes it yield and give way to the Bone of the Foot, that was too much ſtraightn'd to reſume its former place; afterwards you muſt moiſten the Foot with often repeated Applications of <hi>Remolades</hi> or <hi>Ointments for the Feet.</hi>

                     <p>THis Operation is uſually perform'd for the Cure of <hi>Ring-Bones, Falſe-Quarter, Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail, Narrow Heels, Scratches</hi> in the <hi>Cronet, Figgs, Surbating, Stubbing,</hi> and ſeveral other Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sole</hi> is under the Foot, and applied to it almoſt like the <hi>Sole</hi> of a <hi>Shooe;</hi> and the <hi>Hoof</hi> that ſurrounds both the Sole and the Foot, helps to keep it faſt to the Bone of the Foot which it covers. 'Tis a dangerous Error to imagine that the <hi>unſoling</hi> of the Horſe requires the plucking off of the Hoof; for the Value of a Horſe is not at all leſſened by <hi>taking out</hi> the <hi>Sole,</hi> whereas a Horſe that has loſt his Hoof is hardly worth keeping.</p>
                     <p>When ye deſign to take out the <hi>Sole,</hi> you muſt in the firſt place beat down the Heel to make the <hi>Sole</hi> thin and ſlender; then provide a Shooe half a Finger's breadth longer than an ordinary Shooe, and having tack'd it on with four Nails, ſtop the Foot with a warm <hi>Remolade</hi> or ſoftening Pultiſs, covered with Flax and Splents; and if the Bone of the Foot be very dry, you muſt renew the Applications of the <hi>Remolade</hi> to nouriſh and moiſten the Foot, that the Sole may be taken out with leſs difficulty and Pain; for you muſt never undertake to <hi>unſole</hi> a Horſe without ſuch a due and regular Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Sole being well moiſten'd with <hi>Remolades,</hi> or, for want of thoſe, with <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> according to the uſual Cuſtom of Farriers, you muſt open the Heels, and with the Horn of your <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> ſeparate the Sole from the Hoof, and when you find that Inſtrument inſufficient, make uſe of the <hi>Renette,</hi> which is a common Inſtrument among <hi>Farriers,</hi> and uſed alſo by <hi>Sadlers</hi> for the ſtripeing of <hi>Hungary</hi> Leather.</p>
                     <p>Having looſen'd the Sole from the Hoof, you muſt begin to ſeparate it at the Toe with a <hi>Sole-Lifter,</hi> which is only a worn <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> half an Inch broad, and flat at the end; then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it at the ſides with the <hi>Pincers;</hi> and if it ſtick ſo faſt that you cannot ſeparate it at the ſide, divide it underneath with the <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> and afterwards ſeparate it on the other ſide with the <hi>Pincers.</hi> If it ſtick to the Heel, cut it off with the <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> then raiſe it up at the end with a <hi>Sole-lifter,</hi> and taking hold with the <hi>Pincers,</hi> you may pull it out entirely without the leaſt violence: After which, if the Heels be too narrow, tho' the Horſe be <hi>unſol'd</hi> for ſome other Diſtemper in his Foot, you muſt cleave the <hi>Fruſh</hi> quite thro' the middle with your <hi>Fleam,</hi> from the inſide of the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> till you come within three Fingers breadth of the end of the <hi>Fruſh.</hi> Then conſider whether there is not part of the old Sole ſtill remaining, which you muſt alſo take out, and ſuffer the Foot to bleed abundantly. When you perceive that 'tis time to ſtop the Blood, tie a Cord about the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> and as ſoon as 'tis quite ſtop'd, ſet on the Shooe, which muſt not be taken off again, only you muſt leave an empty ſpace at the Toe to drain the ſuperfluous moiſture in the Foot; but if there be ſome other Sore on the inſide Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the Shooe covers, you muſt not ſet on the Shooe ſo faſt; for otherwiſe you would be oblig'd to Shooe and Unſhooe him at every dreſſing, to the extreme prejudice of the Horſe's Foot; and therefore you muſt only tack it on with four Nails.</p>
                     <p>After the Blood is ſtopt dry the Foot with Flax, and if there be no Sore in it, ſtop it with a Compoſition of equal quantities of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Tarr,</hi> melted over the Fire, and poured in hot, covering the Sole with Rolls of Flax moiſten'd in the ſame Compoſition; then lay on ſome Splents of Wood, and one of Iron, and ſet on the Shoe; after which ſtop the <hi>Fruſh</hi> with Bolſters, moiſten'd as before, and thruſt 'em into the Cleft to keep it open, that the Heel may be ſufficiently wide when the Sole grows again, tying a Bandage about 'em to keep 'em from ſlipping out of the Cleft of the <hi>Fruſh:</hi> Or inſtead of the former Compoſition, you may uſe one made of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Soot,</hi> which is a very good Aſtringent, and both aſſwages the Pain, and is endu'd with a diſſolving quality.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the common Opinion of Farriers, that a ſtraight Bandage, by ſqueezing the Part, prevents the growing of Proud-Fleſh; but that Method would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contrary effect; for ſuch a hard binding of the Part muſt neceſſarily be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Pain, which draws down Defluxions, and haſtens thoſe Inconveniencies which they endeavour to avoid. And therefore you muſt only keep the Dreſſing from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179659:295"/>falling off, without tying the Part too hard; for ſo the Sole will grow more ſpeedily, and with leſs danger of raiſing too high. Experience will convince all thoſe who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Directions, of the Truth of this Aſſertion; for this is the only proper Method of <hi>unſoling</hi> a Horſe.</p>
                     <p>When that Operation is perform'd for any Infirmity in the Foot, you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve all the above-mention'd Directions; but if it be only uſed as a Remedy for <hi>Ring-Bones, Narrow-Heels,</hi> and ſuch other Diſtempers that do not properly affect the Foot; after you have ſtopt the Blood, you muſt only waſh the Sole with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and pare away the thickneſs of a Silver Crown of the Hoof at the Toe, leaving an empty ſpace between that and the Shooe, of the breadth of your Finger, to drain the remaining moiſture from the Foot; then ſet on the Shooe, and ſtop the Foot with a Compoſition of <hi>Honey, Turpentine,</hi> and <hi>Tarr,</hi> apply'd hot, with a great deal of Flax and Splents over all, without preſſing the Sole. Five Days after take off the Dreſſing, without removing the Shooe, applying only Flax moiſten'd in <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and renewing the ſame Application every two Days, till the Cure be compleated, as it will be in eighteen or twenty Days at moſt, if there be no other Sore in the Foot but what proceeds from the taking out of the Sole.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, when the Sole is open'd for <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stubb,</hi> the Part muſt be preſt hard to hinder the growing of <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> which otherwiſe would certainly appear, becauſe when the <hi>Sole</hi> is open'd only in one Part, all the Humours flow thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and form that which we call a <hi>Cherry,</hi> or a fleſhy Lump, of the bigneſs of a <hi>Nut</hi> or <hi>Cherry;</hi> but the caſe is quite different when the <hi>Sole</hi> is entirely taken away; for nothing preſſeth the Bone of the Foot, as in the other Inſtance the <hi>Sole</hi> does, except only that Part where the opening is made. 'Tis plain from this Example, that an <hi>Unſol'd</hi> Foot muſt not be preſs'd; for that which drives the Humours to the Hole or opening in the <hi>Sole,</hi> is the preſſion of all the reſt of that Part, which makes it a very difficult Task to prevent a Swelling; but when the <hi>Sole</hi> is taken out there is no preſſure, nor flowing of Humours, and conſequently the Foot remains in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition, whereas if you preſs it, ſince you cannot preſs it every where equally, the Humours will be driven to ſome Part, and a Swelling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd.</p>
                     <p>Lay the above-mention'd <hi>reſtringent Charge</hi> about the Foot, which is made by boiling <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Soot</hi> together, ſtirring them always over a little Fire, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Curdling, till they be perfectly incorporated, and reduc'd to the conſiſtence of a <hi>Honey-Charge.</hi> Obſerve alſo to ſhave away the Hair on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and to rub the Part very hard till it grow hot, to open the Pores, that the Medicine may pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the deeper. Thus one application will be more effectual than ſix would be without obſerving of that Caution. The Part being thus prepar'd, apply the Compoſition warm about the <hi>Cronet;</hi> for this Remedy will both bind the Parts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and nouriſh the Hoof, which is always too much dried by other <hi>Reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents;</hi> then lay ſome Flax over it, and a Cover over all, binding it on with a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, about an Inch broad.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Sole</hi> grows again, if you perceive the Fleſh to be higher in ſome Parts than in others, apply bruis'd or beaten <hi>Nettles</hi> with a Bandage and Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts upon the Part. If ſuch an Accident happen in the Winter, when there is no <hi>Nettles,</hi> moiſten the Part with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> and apply <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Egyptiacum,</hi> with a Bolſter of Flax, and a Bandage over all; the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> is alſo very effectual in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>If any part of the <hi>Sole</hi> appear foul or frothy, or if the Fleſh be not cover'd with the <hi>Sole,</hi> the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> alone will remove thoſe Inconveniencies, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Part. If the Fleſh riſe too high in any Part, ſtrew a little Powder of burnt <hi>Allom</hi> upon it, and apply the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment,</hi> continuing after the ſame manner till the <hi>Sole</hi> be well grown and firm. Inſtead of the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> you may uſe that of <hi>Schmit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the live Fleſh remain too long uncover'd, and without a <hi>Sole,</hi> bruiſe the Leaves of the great <hi>Burdock,</hi> and apply them to the Part with a convenient Dreſſing.</p>
                     <p>If the Part be weaken'd by ſuperfluous Moiſture, cover it with Bolſters of Flax, without any other Application; but firſt you muſt waſh the <hi>Sole</hi> with <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> which binds and ſtrengthens very effectually.</p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:179659:295"/>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sole</hi> be too dry, apply a <hi>Remolade</hi> or <hi>Softening Pultiſs.</hi> If the Drineſs increaſe to ſuch a degree, as to make the Horſe Lame, melt <hi>Tarr</hi> upon the <hi>Sole,</hi> or <hi>Ship-Pitch,</hi> which is compos'd of two third Parts of <hi>Black-Pitch,</hi> and one third of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> melted and mixt together.</p>
                     <p>If it will not grow firm, but ſtill remains ſo looſe as to fluctuate under your Finger, bruiſe the Leaves of <hi>great Celandine,</hi> and apply them to the Part; for that Herb dries very powerfully, and two or three Applications will make the <hi>Sole</hi> firm and ſtrong. If neither <hi>Fleſh</hi> nor <hi>Sole</hi> will grow on ſome parts of the Bone of the Foot, apply the following Ointment.</p>

                           <hi>An</hi> Incarnative, <hi>or</hi> Ointment <hi>to make the</hi> Fleſh <hi>grow.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Venice-Turpentine</hi> well waſh'd, the <hi>Yolks</hi> of ſix <hi>Eggs,</hi> fine <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> of each two Drams in very fine Powder; beat all the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients together, and incorporate 'em to the thickneſs of an Ointment. This Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by Farriers call'd a <hi>Digeſtive;</hi> neither will I contend about the Name, if the thing it ſelf be underſtood: And therefore I ſhall only acquaint the Reader, that this Remedy may be very uſefully apply'd to make the Fleſh grow upon any Part. Mr. <hi>Curtis's Ointment</hi> produces the ſame effect; for if it be apply'd cold to the Bone, by way of Plaiſter, and renew'd every two Days, it will certainly produce new Fleſh: In the mean time you muſt keep your Horſe in the Stable, till the end of the Cure, which you may expect in three Weeks at fartheſt, if he be not troubl'd with ſome other Diſtemper. If the Hoof begin to ſeparate about the Hair, obſerve the Method preſcrib'd in the following Chapter, for the breaking of an Impoſtume in that Part.</p>
                        <p>Some curious Perſons make uſe of certain pieces of Iron, ſurrounded with a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they apply without Nails, by means of a Screw that ſhuts and opens 'em. This is certainly a good Invention for a Horſe that has a weak Foot, or for one that is apt to kick, ſhake his Foot, and will not give you time to tack on a Shooe with four Nails; but this Inſtrument of which you may ſee the Figure in <hi>Frederick Griſon,</hi> muſt be purpoſely made for every Horſe, and more exactly fram'd than thoſe that are commonly us'd.</p>
                        <p>The ſureſt way is to ſet on a Shooe ſo faſt that it may not be afterwards remov'd, to prevent the Numneſs that might be occaſion'd in the Foot, by ſuch frequent Shooing and Unſhooing. Thus, for Example, if there be an Inflammation cauſed by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated Blood at the Corner of the Heel, ſuppoſing that you have unſol'd your Horſe, you muſt cut the Sponge of the Shooe on that ſide, fitting on the Dreſſing with an Iron Splent, beginning under the Toe of the Shooe, and binding it on at the other end; for 'tis always ſafeſt and moſt convenient to dreſs an unſol'd Foot, without taking off the Shooe. But in ſome caſes that method is impracticable; and after you have taken out the <hi>Sole,</hi> you muſt only tack on a Shooe with four Nails, that you may examine the bottom of the Sore, as often as you dreſs it.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd once as I was taking out a <hi>Sole,</hi> that the Horſe ſtruggl'd ſo violently, that the Ham-ſtring or Sinew was ſtrain'd, and the Farrier concluded that his Thigh was broken. This accident hinder'd me from removing the Dreſſing that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready apply'd to the <hi>Sole,</hi> and from taking off the Shooe, for fear of hurting the Hoof, by lifting up the Foot to dreſs it; and therefore I ſuffer'd it to remain without renewing the Application for the ſpace of ſix Weeks; after which we found the <hi>Sole</hi> ſo well grown, that if I had not ſeen the Operation perform'd, I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the <hi>Sole</hi> had never been taken out; and this good effect was produc'd by one application of a Remedy, conſiſting of equal Parts of <hi>Turpentine, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Tarr.</hi> This Example may undeceive thoſe who imagine the Cure of an <hi>unſol'd</hi> Hoof to be very difficult; for certainly if there be no other Diſtemper in the Part, it may be perfectly heal'd with one Application. But all the above-mention'd Directions are deſign'd for the Cure of thoſe Diſtempers that occaſion the taking out of the <hi>Sole.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XC. <hi>Of</hi> Figgs <hi>growing in a Horſe's Foot.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>AFigg</hi> is an excreſcency of ſpongy and fibrous Fleſh, ſometimes reſembling a <hi>Wart</hi> which grows on ſtrong, high, and hollow Feet, that have large Heels, and ſeldom or never on thoſe that are weak, ſlender, and flat. Theſe Tumours are almoſt always ſeated on the top, or at the ſide of the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and ſeldom appear in any other place, if they be not occaſion'd by the Farriers neglect; for if they be ſuffer'd to grow old, or dry'd with ſtrong Ointments, they take another courſe, and ſpread to the corner of the <hi>Sole</hi> at the Heel, the ſide Quarters, or Toe. The ſame Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency happens when they are unskilfully dreſs'd; in which caſe they ſtick to the Griſtle, or to the Bone of the Foot, and afterwards riſe to the Hair, appearing on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and are always attended with rottenneſs and ſtink. They are moiſten'd and nouriſh'd by a Humour deriv'd from the Sinews, which being deſtitute of the Spirits that preſerv'd it in its natural Condition, while it remain'd in the Sinews, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into a very noiſome Putrefaction, that can hardly be ſtopt; for the moſt perfect Matter, when it degenerates and is corrupted, is infinitely more dangerous than another leſs perfect Matter; and the Cure is ſo difficult, that unleſs the fatal Conſequences of its virulencies be prevented by well choſen and ſeaſonably apply'd Remedies, the Horſe grows irrecoverably Lame.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Figgs</hi> that appear on the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> rarely occaſion Lameneſs in the beginning; but if they be either unskilfully dreſt, dry'd, or too long neglected, they ſpread under the <hi>Sole,</hi> and penetrate to the Hair ſticking to the Griſtle on the Bone of the Foot, where they are attended with Pain, tho' at the firſt they were free from that ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of thoſe Excreſcencies, as I intimated before, is the Nervous Juice, which alſo generates and nouriſhes <hi>Warts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They appear either in the form of <hi>Warts,</hi> when they grow on the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> or are only diſtinguiſhable by that fibrous and ſpongy Fleſh that appears under the <hi>Sole,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts part of it by the wiſe contrivance of Nature, to diſcharge by that opening a part of the Matter that offends her.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Figgs</hi> are uſually the Sink that drains all the corrupt Humours in the Body, which flowing thither in great abundance, encreaſe the Malignitie of thoſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcencies, tho' they are not the original cauſe of the Diſtemper. The redundancy of thoſe Humours is ſometimes ſo exceſſive, that 'tis impoſſible either to exhauſt the <hi>Source</hi> of them, or to divert the <hi>Stream</hi> that flows from it, ſo that the <hi>Figgs</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to a prodigious bigneſs, infecting and corrupting the whole Part, and even ſometimes ſpoiling the Bone of the Foot.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen <hi>Gourdy</hi> Legs full of <hi>Watry Swellings</hi> and <hi>Warts,</hi> which being dried, were immediately ſucceeded by <hi>Figgs</hi> in the Foot; and as ſoon as theſe were extirpated, the Leg was again ſeiz'd with thoſe running and noiſome Sores that were cur'd with ſo much difficulty before. The Cure was a ſecond time attempted, and no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, but the Foot was again cover'd with <hi>Figgs;</hi> and thoſe ſucceſſive Revolutions of theſe different kinds of Sores are peculiar to old Horſes, whoſe Legs are <hi>Gourded,</hi> and cannot be reduced to their natural Shape, or to thoſe who have a Swelling in their Legs, occaſion'd by ſome remainders of the <hi>Farcin;</hi> for ſince the corrupt Humours of the whole Body are diſcharg'd by the <hi>Gourdy</hi> Leg, if their paſſage be ſtopt, they bend their courſe to the <hi>Foot,</hi> where they produce <hi>Figgs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Horſe has been troubl'd for ſome conſiderable time with this Infirmity, his Foot becomes deform'd, and grows viſibly larger than the other.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Figgs</hi> that appear on the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and are not faſtn'd to the Griſtle or Bone of the Foot, do not make the Horſe halt, unleſs they accidentally touch the Ground; ſo that unleſs the Part be carefully examin'd, a Man may be eaſily deceiv'd. Thus at <hi>Paris</hi> the Horſe-Courſers never buy a Horſe for Service till they lift up his Feet to ſee whether he be troubl'd with <hi>Figgs,</hi> eſpecially on the hinder Feet; tho' all this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot ſave 'em from being cheated ſometimes, ſince there are ſome Horſes that ſeem to be cur'd of the <hi>Figgs,</hi> which, at the end of three Months, return with as much violence as ever.</p>

                           <hi>Remedies for the</hi> Figg <hi>in a Horſe's Foot.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Before you apply any Remedies to the <hi>Figgs,</hi> if there be watry Sores or Swellings in the Leg, you muſt endeavour to Cure 'em with a white <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> which will aſſwage the Swelling, remove the Pain, and diſſipate the Humours that nouriſh the <hi>Figg,</hi> and hinder the Cure: To proceed with order, I ſhall conſider, in the firſt place, the <hi>Figgs</hi> that grow on the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> which may be ſometimes cur'd without taking out the <hi>Sole.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Pare the Foot, cutting away ſo much of the Hoof that there may be a convenient ſpace to reach the Sore with your <hi>Fleam</hi> or <hi>Lancet;</hi> then cut the <hi>Sole</hi> about the <hi>Figgs,</hi> and extirpate the very Roots of them; for if you take away only the Tops, the Cure will be imperfect, becauſe tho' they appear ſmall on the out-ſide, they are larger under the Sore; but in the mean time, I ſuppoſe that they are not faſten'd to the Griſtle or Bone of the Foot.</p>
                        <p>Having laid open the Sore, take two Pounds of <hi>Honey,</hi> a Pint of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> ſix Ounces of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> in very fine Powder, ſearc'd thro' a ſilken Sieve, a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>White-Vitriol</hi> beaten ſmall, four Ounces of <hi>Litharge</hi> reduc'd to very fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and two Drams of <hi>Arſenick</hi> beaten and ſearc'd thro' a fine Sieve. Mix all the Ingredients with the <hi>Honey</hi> in a clean Earthen Pot, and boil them over a very gentle Fire, ſtirring 'em frequently, till they be reduc'd to the thickneſs of an Ointment, which muſt be apply'd on Bolſters of Flax to the <hi>Figg.</hi> If the Inciſion make the part Bleed, which muſt be avoided, if poſſible, apply for the firſt Dreſſing, the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>reſtringent Charge</hi> made of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Soot,</hi> laying it on warm with Rowlers, Bandage, and Splents, to ſtanch the Blood. Two Days after apply the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſcrib'd in the preceding Paragraph, laying it on warm, and binding it hard with Rowlers and Splents, placing Tents at the ſide to keep it firm, and to hinder it from ſpreading, and leaving the part of the <hi>Fruſh</hi> that touches the <hi>Figg</hi> uncover'd. 'Tis to be obſerv'd that the Flax muſt be dry, that the Tents muſt be rowl'd hard before you put the Ointments upon 'em, and that the Horſe muſt be kept very dry; for <hi>Moiſture</hi> is very prejudicial in this caſe, and obſtructs the Cure.</p>
                        <p>After forty eight Hours remove the ſecond Dreſſing, and wiping the Sore with dry Flax, obſerve whether there are more Fibres or Roots that muſt be laid open; then waſh the <hi>Figg</hi> with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> and apply the above-mention'd Ointment, which may be called the <hi>Ointment for the Figgs,</hi> binding it on with Rowlers and Splents, and placing Tents and Rowlers on both ſides to keep it from ſpreading, as you was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed; for ſome part of the Cure depends on the titeneſs of the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                        <p>When you remove the Dreſſing, ſeparate gently with a Slice or Spatula, the little Scabs, or rather Scurfs, produced by the Ointment, taking all poſſible care to prevent Bleeding. If after one or two Applications you perceive not any conſiderable effect of the Ointment, add three Ounces of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> to one half of the Compoſition, mixing 'em cold, and ſuffering 'em to foment; after which make uſe of the Ointment as before, and it will certainly diſſolve the <hi>Figg;</hi> but in the mean time you muſt not neglect to bind on the Rowlers carefully, and to renew the Application once in forty eight Hours. When you take off the Dreſſing, if you perceive that the <hi>Figg</hi> is ſufficiently mortifi'd, apply the firſt Ointment, and afterwards you may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſecond upon occaſion, obſerving the varieties of Circumſtances with great care and niceneſs. If the Fleſh grow too faſt in any part, apply the Ointment with the addition of <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> but when you deſign only to dry the Part, the ſimple Ointment will be ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Figg</hi> be faſtn'd to the Griſtle or Bone of the Foot and communicate with thoſe Parts, when it ſeems to be cur'd on one ſide, it ſpreads, and ſometimes runs even to the Heel under the Quarter, which frequently muſt be cut. And after you have made an Inciſion into the Quarter, you muſt remove the Griſtle with the ſame Cauſticks, either in Powder or Ointment that are preſcrib'd in the Chapter of the <hi>Quitterbone;</hi> for without taking away the Griſtle 'tis impoſſible to Cure the <hi>Figg.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Figg</hi> be very large, as ſometimes 'tis equal to a ſmall Hens Egg, 'twill be very convenient, after you have ſearch'd all around, to diſcover the hollow places under the Scale where the Roots of the <hi>Figg</hi> lurk, and lay 'em open with a crooked and double edg'd <hi>Fleam,</hi> to cut out the whole <hi>Figg</hi> with a ſharp <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> extirpating en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely all the Putrefaction and corrupt Fleſh. Then ſuffer the Horſe to bleed freely,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179659:297"/>lengthen his Shooes, and tye a Cord about the <hi>Paſtern</hi> to ſtop the Blood; after which cover the Wound with ſmall Salt, and over that apply Flax moiſten'd with <hi>Turpentine,</hi> boil'd with <hi>Soot.</hi> If the Blood flow ſo faſt that you cannot ſtrew the Wound with <hi>Salt,</hi> mix the <hi>Salt</hi> with the Compoſition, apply it warm, bind up the Foot carefully with an Iron Splent laid croſs-wiſe to keep on the Dreſſing, and lay the ſame <hi>Defenſive</hi> about the <hi>Cronet,</hi> ſuffering the Application to remain untouch'd for the ſpace of three Days, keeping the Horſe in the mean time in a very dry place.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Figg</hi> be on the hinder Foot, as 'tis almoſt always, as often as the Horſe Dungs you muſt immediately remove his Excrements from under his Feet, that the <hi>Sole</hi> may not receive the leaſt <hi>moiſture,</hi> which wonderfully obſtructs the Cure.</p>
                        <p>When you take off the Dreſſing, cleanſe the Part carefully with dry Flax and a Slice, then apply the Ointment with Bolſters, binding it on with Iron-Splents as before; only there will be no occaſion for the <hi>Defenſive</hi> about the <hi>Cronet.</hi> Two Days after remove the Dreſſing, and conſider the colour of the Fleſh; and having waſh'd it with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> apply the Ointment with the Addition of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> if the Fleſh be foul, and the ſimple Ointment to thoſe Parts where the Fleſh is clean and fair, continuing after the ſame manner for ſome Days. Some tender Horſes loſe their Appetite on this occaſion; and therefore you muſt tye a <hi>Chewing-Ball</hi> to the Bit, and give 'em good <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> and <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> to eat.</p>
                        <p>The continu'd uſe of theſe Directions will reſtore the Horſe's Appetite which is a point of great Importance.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Figg</hi> be faſten'd to the Griſtle or Bone of the Foot, the ſureſt Remedy is to take out the <hi>Sole,</hi> according to the Method deſcrib'd in the preceding <hi>Chapter;</hi> and then dreſs the <hi>Figg</hi> as before, and if there be occaſion, either cut out the Griſtle, or conſume it with <hi>Cauſticks.</hi> I ſhall take this occaſion to advertiſe the Reader, that I never apply a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> when 'tis poſſible to perform the Operation with a <hi>Razor;</hi> for he that uſes this Inſtrument has the conveniency of ſeeing what he does, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and guiding it as he pleaſes; nor is Inciſion attended with ſo much Pain as a <hi>Cauſtic;</hi> and even tho' there be a Scale of a Bone in the Foot to be ſeparated, 'tis better to make uſe of a red-hot Iron than a <hi>Cauſtic;</hi> and for the ſame purpoſe I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apply <hi>Egyptiacum</hi> with <hi>Sugar,</hi> or <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Borax</hi> in Powder, mixt with <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Violent <hi>Cauteries</hi> are dangerous in this caſe, for they hurt the Bone of the Foot, and cauſe an <hi>Exfoliation,</hi> which is more troubleſome and tedious than the Cure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; and beſides they repel the Humours which occaſion ſeveral not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſorders.</p>
                        <p>During the Cure of this Diſtemper, 'twill be very convenient to make your Horſe eat every Day ſome <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> to make a revulſion, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the quantity of the Humours that fall upon the Part; for ſince that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſiſts all Impurities, 'twill deſtroy the Cauſes of the Humour that moiſtens and nouriſhes the <hi>Figgs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the Cure is compleated to prevent any ſucceeding Danger (tho' this Caution be not abſolutely neceſſary) you may <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Paſtern-Veins</hi> of the Sore Foot; for ſince the <hi>Paſtern-Veins</hi> carry great abundance of ſuperfluous Blood to the lower part of the Foot, it happens very frequently that the Blood is chang'd into Corruption and Matter; and therefore by <hi>taking up</hi> the Vein, the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Figg</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, and the danger of a Relapſe prevented, tho' the Cure may be perform'd without that precaution.</p>
                        <p>Many <hi>Farriers</hi> endeavour to diſcredit this Operation, becauſe they are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to it, but 'tis not attended with any dangerous Conſequences; for tho' the Skin is very thick in thoſe Parts, 'tis impoſſible to Lame a Horſe by <hi>taking up</hi> the Veins, unleſs it be done purpoſely: and therefore if your Farrier endeavour to perſwade you, that 'tis either uſeleſs or dangerous to <hi>take up</hi> the Veins, you may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he does not know how to perform the Operation.</p>
                        <p>When the Cure is perfected, the Fleſh every where clean and ſweet, no Roots nor Corruption appearing, and only a great hollow or void place remaining in the Foot, oppoſite to the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> or in any other part of it, by reaſon of the great quantity of Fleſh that was either cut out or conſum'd; ſtrew the whole Part with <hi>Roſin</hi> mixt with <hi>Flax,</hi> or an old <hi>Rope</hi> ſliced ſmall, which will fill up the Wound with Fleſh, if it be kept on with Bolſters of Flax, and renew'd every two Days. If the Fleſh grow too faſt, as ſometimes it does, after one or two Applications, waſh the Part with the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179659:297"/>
                           <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> and ſtrew it with chopt Flax, and Powder of <hi>Roſin,</hi> covering it with dry Flax and <hi>Splents.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have often obſerv'd in thoſe Horſes that are troubl'd with <hi>four Figgs,</hi> one in each Foot, that <hi>three</hi> of 'em may be eaſily cur'd; but the <hi>fourth</hi> is almoſt always incurable, becauſe the Humours that fed all the reſt is diſcharg'd upon this alone.</p>
                        <p>When the Part is fill'd up with Fleſh, 'twill be convenient to dry it with Powder of <hi>calcin'd Tartar,</hi> which will produce a Scurf that muſt not be remov'd till it fall away of it ſelf; then apply a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> about the whole Foot made of Powder of <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> mixt with the <hi>ſecond Water</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and reduc'd to a Paſte, or, for want of that, a <hi>black Reſtringent Charge,</hi> which will compleat the growth of the <hi>Sole</hi> and <hi>Fruſh;</hi> and the natural ſhape of both thoſe Parts may be reſtor'd by the help of Iron Inſtruments, after which the Horſe will quickly be in a condition to endure Labour. But, during the whole progreſs of the Cure, you muſt obſerve with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary exactneſs and Judgment all the above-mention'd Cautions and Directions concerning the change and due Application of the Remedies. After you have cut off the upper part of the <hi>Figg,</hi> you may burn the reſt with a red-hot Knife, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents bleeding; and then apply Bolſters with <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> to take away the Pain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the burning, and bind on the Dreſſing and Splents as before. Two Days after take off the Dreſſing, waſh the Sore, and wipe it very clean with dry Flax, then endeavour to remove the Scab with a <hi>Slice,</hi> and apply <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> as at firſt. When the Scab is fallen off, after two or three Dreſſings burn the <hi>Figg</hi> again, continuing after the ſame manner till the Fleſh appear clean, ſound, and natural; after which dry the Part as before.</p>
                        <p>Some preferr this Method before the uſe of <hi>Ointments,</hi> and it muſt be acknowledg'd, that it performs the Cure more ſpeedily; but the <hi>Figgs</hi> return, and beſides, the Griſtle that keeps the <hi>Fruſh</hi> firm is ſo ſpoil'd by the <hi>Fire,</hi> that the Diſeaſe can never afterwards be Cur'd, either by the <hi>Fire,</hi> or otherwiſe, as I have oftentimes obſerv'd in my Practice, and for that reaſon have left off the uſe of <hi>Fire,</hi> which I preſcrib'd for the Cure of this Diſtemper in the preceeding Editions of this Book.</p>
                        <p>They who make uſe of violent <hi>Cauteries</hi> or <hi>Cauſtics</hi> will never be able to perform the Cure with Succeſs; for the Humour is only tranſlated or repell'd to another ſide, and when the <hi>Figg</hi> ſeems to be extirpated on one ſide, it breaks out on the other, and ſticks to the Griſtle or Bone of the Foot; which inconveniency might be prevented by a due Application of the Ointments for ſtopping the courſe of the Humours, of which Nature there are ſeveral Compoſitions in this Book, and by mixing <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> with 'em when they are too weak. If the <hi>Figg</hi> be faſten'd to the Bone of the Foot, you muſt promote the ſeparation of the <hi>Scale,</hi> and afterwards apply the <hi>Ointment Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum,</hi> or the <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> dreſſing the Sore below, and endeavouring always to cloſe it above. I might produce ſeveral Inſtances of the Cure of this Diſtemper, but ſhall content my ſelf with what I have ſaid already on that ſubject.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XCI. <hi>Of</hi> Retraits <hi>or</hi> Pricks <hi>with</hi> Stubs, <hi>or with a</hi> Nail <hi>in</hi> Shooing, <hi>or in the</hi> Street.</head>
                     <p>IF a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> be neglected, it may occaſion a very dangerous Sore, and feſter ſo into the Fleſh, that the Horſe's Foot cannot be ſav'd without extream dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; and therefore ſuch fatal Conſequences ought always to be prevented by a timely Cure.</p>
                     <p>When a Farrier perceives in Shooing a Horſe, that he complains or ſhrinks at every blow upon the <hi>Nail,</hi> it muſt be immediately pull'd out, and tho' Blood follow there is no danger; only you muſt not drive another Nail into the ſame place: ſuch an accident ſeldom makes a Horſe halt, and he may be ridden immediately after it.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe halts preſently after he is Shod, you may probably conclude, that ſome of the <hi>Nails</hi> preſs the Vein, or touches him in the Quick. To know where the Grief lies, lift up his Lame Foot, and knock with your <hi>Shooing-Hammer</hi> on the ſound Foot, (for ſome
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179659:298"/>skittiſh and unruly Horſes will lift their Foot when you touch it, tho' it be not <hi>Prick'd</hi>) that you may be the better able to judge whether the Horſe be <hi>Prick'd</hi> when you touch the Lame Foot. Then lift up the ſound Foot, and knock gently upon the top of the Clenches on the Lame Foot, and when you perceive that he ſhrinks when you ſtrike any of the <hi>Nails,</hi> you may conclude him to be <hi>Prick'd</hi> in that place. Horſes are uſually <hi>Prick'd</hi> at the Heel in the Fore-foot, and at the Toe in the Hinder-foot. Then you muſt pluck off the Shooe, preſſing round the Foot with the Pincers, and when you come to the place that is <hi>Prick'd,</hi> he will endeavour to draw back his Foot, and ſhrink extreamly.</p>
                     <p>As you draw forth the <hi>Nails,</hi> you muſt obſerve diligently whether they are bow'd, or whether there be any Flakes, or if the Hole ſend forth Blood or Matter; for a bow'd Nail may occaſion Lameneſs by preſſing the Vein, and a Flake may either preſs the Fleſh or the Vein, and even ſometimes you may perceive by the <hi>Nail,</hi> that the Flake remains in the Foot, which is a bad ſign, for you can hardly ever pull it out, and ſo long as it continues in the Foot, 'tis impoſſible to perform the Cure. <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> iſſuing out of the Hole, is an evident ſign of the griev'd Part, which being diſcover'd you muſt ſearch the place to the bottom with the Horn of your <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> then with your <hi>Renette</hi> ſearch the Hole, penetrating to the end of it, where the <hi>Nail</hi> was rivetted on the Hoof; if in the mean time you find that it does not pierce to the Quick, nor cauſes any Pain, thruſt a <hi>Nail</hi> into the Hole, and preſs the point of it on that ſide where the Vein lies; and if you perceive that the Horſe <hi>complains,</hi> proceed to the application of convenient Remedies, without any further tryal.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe does not <hi>complain</hi> when you ſearch the Hole, you may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he is not <hi>Prick'd</hi> in that place, ſince you have examin'd the whole length of the Hole without finding any Matter, and without occaſioning the leaſt Pain.</p>
                     <p>It happens not unfrequently, that thoſe Horſes who have fleſhy Feet, ſlender Hoofs, and weak or narrow Heels, are always Lame when they are new Shod; and ſometimes to ſuch a degree, that they are hardly able to ſtand upright, but they recover without the uſe of any Remedy: And 'tis to be obſerv'd, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſes are uſually moſt ſubject to this inconveniency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Narrow-heel'd</hi> Horſes are uſually Lam'd if the <hi>Nails</hi> are riveted too high; for tho' they be not <hi>Prick'd,</hi> the Nails pierce too near the <hi>Quick,</hi> and occaſion a Pain that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no other Cure but <hi>reſt.</hi> If a <hi>Nail</hi> be bow'd in a fleſhy Foot, it frequently makes the Horſe halt, tho' he be not <hi>Prick'd;</hi> and if it be neglected too long, 'twill cauſe a Sore, which muſt be cur'd as if the Horſe were really <hi>Prick'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the place be <hi>Impoſthumated,</hi> after you have procured the evacuation of the Matter, inject boyling <hi>Oil</hi> with a little <hi>Sugar,</hi> and ſtop the Hole with Cotton; then tack on the Shooe with three or four Nails, and ſtop the Foot with a <hi>Remolade,</hi> which will draw the Heat into the <hi>Sole,</hi> hinder the Matter from riſing up to the Hair, and take away the Pain: Beſides, you muſt apply a <hi>black, white,</hi> or <hi>red Reſtringent Charge</hi> about the Foot, keeping it from moiſture, and continue to dreſs it every Day till your Horſe be ſound.</p>
                     <p>The following Remedy is good for <hi>Pricking</hi> with a <hi>Nail:</hi> As ſoon as you have open'd the Sore, inject the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> cold, ſtopping the Hole with <hi>Cotton;</hi> the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be renew'd the next Day, which will compleat the Cure. If you cannot procure the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> dreſs the Sore every Day with <hi>Unguentum Pompholygos,</hi> and in few Days the Cure will be perfected. If neither of theſe Medicines can be had, take a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Milfoil,</hi> beat it, and boil it with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> in an Iron-Spoon or Ladle, ſtirring it two or three times; then pour the <hi>Vinegar</hi> very hot into the Hole made by the <hi>Nail,</hi> and lay the <hi>Herbs</hi> upon it, continuing after the ſame manner till it be heal'd.</p>
                     <p>I could make a very numerous Catalogue of Remedies for a <hi>Prick</hi> in a Horſe's Foot, but there are none more excellent than the <hi>Vulnerary Water, Unguentum Pampholygos,</hi> and <hi>Oil de Merveille,</hi> which are known to be admirably effectual in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes have their <hi>Heels</hi> ſo low, that they knock 'em againſt the Ground as they go, ſo that they halt down-right; and in the mean time the Farrier ſearches about the <hi>Foot, Paſtern-Joint, Shoulder,</hi> and other Parts, never imagining that the Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is occaſion'd by a Bruiſe in the <hi>Fruſh.</hi> If you perceive that the <hi>Fruſh</hi> trembles when you touch it, and that there is Matter form'd underneath, you may conclude the Seat of the Grief to be there; in which caſe you muſt dreſs the Sore like a Wound made by a Nail, and make the Remedies penetrate thro' the Heel between the <hi>Fraſh</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:179659:298"/>and Bone of the Foot, applying proper <hi>Reſtringents</hi> of <hi>Lime,</hi> and the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or of <hi>Soot, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> about the <hi>Fruſh.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of theſe Sores or Impoſthumes is more difficult than the <hi>Cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All <hi>Vulnerary Herbs</hi> are good for <hi>Pricks</hi> in the beginning, as <hi>Savin, Vervain, Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Speedwell, Agrimony, Zedoary, Adder's-Tongue, Arſmart, Ladies Bed-ſtraw, Dragons,</hi> and ſeveral others, which muſt be applied with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> according to the Directions already preſcrib'd in the uſe of <hi>Milfoil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I thought fit to mention a conſiderable number of 'em, that as ſoon as your Horſe is <hi>Prick'd</hi> you may eaſily find one or other; but thoſe who know none of 'em muſt make uſe of proper <hi>Ointments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning before the Wound be <hi>Impoſtumated,</hi> you may with good Succeſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Method; after the Hole is diſcover'd, pour ſome <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> into it, ſtop it with <hi>Cotton,</hi> and ſet on the Shooe; if your Horſe grow Lame again take off the Shooe, dreſs his Foot with <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> as before, and in few Days he will be perfectly ſound. The <hi>Ointment of Pompbolix</hi> is alſo an excellent Remedy for <hi>Oxen</hi> that are hurt in the Feet with the Plow, as ſometimes it happens by the unskilfulneſs of the Plow-man; in which caſe you muſt open the Sore, waſh it well with warm <hi>Wine,</hi> melt ſome of the <hi>Ointment</hi> into it, ſtop the Hole and continue after the ſame manner till the Cure be perfected.</p>

                     <p>IN great Cities, the Streets are uſually full of <hi>Nails,</hi> which frequently <hi>Prick</hi> the Feet of Horſes, and therefore aſſoon as a Coach-man perceives his Horſe begin to halt, he ought immediately to alight and pluck out the <hi>Nail,</hi> leſt the Horſe, by continuing to tread upon the Stones, drive it into the head, as it happens very often.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are alſo <hi>Prick'd</hi> with <hi>Stubs,</hi> or Splinters of Wood, which pierce the <hi>Sole,</hi> and ſometimes reach to the Bone of the Foot: And both theſe Accidents are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the occaſion of dangerous and ſtubborn Sores.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as you perceive that your Horſe is <hi>Prick'd</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub,</hi> you muſt pluck it out, and if it be follow'd with Blood, 'tis a good ſign. If no Blood appear, you may continue your Journey, if your Horſe does not halt; but if he be Lame, the ſafeſt way is to apply a preſent Remedy. After the <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub</hi> is drawn forth, melt ſome <hi>Spaniſh Wax,</hi> and let it fall into the Hole, to keep out Gravel or Dirt; and thus you may, without danger, ride your Horſe to ſome place where you may be able to procure convenient Remedies, as the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> which muſt be applied Cold, or, for want of thoſe, <hi>Unguentum Pompholygos.</hi> I have often obſerv'd, that the application of <hi>Spaniſh Wax</hi> has heal'd the Wound without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble; but if your Horſe continue to halt, you muſt apply the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Remedies, or good <hi>Oil de Merveille,</hi> or any other proper Ointment, and ſtop the Hole with <hi>Cotton.</hi> Apply alſo a good <hi>Remolade</hi> to the <hi>Sole;</hi> and if the Wound be large, a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> about the <hi>Coffin-Bone</hi> at the Toe, continuing to dreſs it after the ſame manner till it be heal'd. If theſe Directions be obſerv'd at the beginning, tho' the Horſe halt right-down he will certainly be cur'd, if the Bone of the Foot, or the Sinew be not <hi>Prick'd.</hi> If there be an old Sore, ſearch the Part with the <hi>Buttreſs,</hi> and probe it gently with a Feather to diſcover the bottom of it, taking care not to hurt the Part: Then heat <hi>Oil of Gabian,</hi> or <hi>De Merveille,</hi> or ſome other hot Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inject 'em warm into the Sore; after which ſtop it with <hi>Cotton,</hi> and lay a <hi>Remolade</hi> upon it with Flax and Splents, repeating the Application, till your Horſe be ſound.</p>
                     <p>As often as you dreſs the Sore, ſqueeze the Matter out with your Thumb, preſſing not only the Sore but the <hi>Paſtern</hi> above the Heel, and then apply the Remedy.</p>
                     <p>At the ſecond Dreſſing, when you unbind the Foot, obſerve whether the <hi>Remolade</hi> be very dry, which, when it happens, denotes a great heat in the Part. Then taking out the Tent if you perceive a <hi>reddiſh Water</hi> to come out of the Sore, inſtead of white well digeſted Matter, 'tis a dangerous ſign. When the Matter is yellow, ſtinking,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179659:299"/>and hard, like Oxe's Greaſe, you may conclude it to be a Nervous Humour that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a difficult Cure; and almoſt always the Sinew is found to be prick'd, the ſtench proceeding from the greatneſs of the Corruption. And therefore you muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately take out the <hi>Sole,</hi> applying good <hi>Reſtringents</hi> to the Toe, and ſides of the Foot; but not to the Heels. Or apply a piece of old <hi>Hog's-Greaſe,</hi> charging the whole Leg with <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> mixt with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> to prevent the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Humours, and ſuffering your Horſe to eat nothing but Bran. If the Wound continue ſtill to diſcharge <hi>red Water,</hi> or hard, ſtinking, or congeal'd Matter; and if at the ſame time the Foot be hot, and the Leg ſwoln, theſe are certain ſigns that the Diſeaſe is dangerous, and will be of long continuance. And even you may reckon your ſelf very Fortunate, if your Horſe be not quite ſpoil'd by the Matter uſually gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on thoſe occaſions in ſome part of the Foot, which may looſen the Hoof at the <hi>Cronet.</hi> To prevent theſe dangerous Conſequences, beſides the <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> and fat <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molades</hi> that were apply'd to the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> to draw the Matter to that Part, as the leaſt dangerous, you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> on the <hi>Paſtern</hi> behind, till you come within an Inch of the <hi>Cronet,</hi> making about twelve Holes with a red-hot Iron, piercing the Skin to evacuate the Humours, and covering the burnt Part with a good <hi>Remolade,</hi> or with an equal mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Tarr,</hi> and <hi>Honey;</hi> for this Operation will certainly give eaſe to your Horſe. If before you <hi>give the Fire</hi> you perceive, that there is Matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready generated in the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> if the Part be hard and ſwoll'n; and if, when you preſs it, the Matter runs out at the Hole in the Foot, you muſt in that caſe open a paſſage to the place where the Matter is generated, and put in a Leaden Seton, if poſſible, filling up all the Part with Flax moiſten'd with <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> with ſome <hi>Aloes,</hi> to reſiſt the Corruption; but 'tis not always neceſſary to make a <hi>Seton,</hi> eſpecially if the Holes be not directly oppoſite; for then they muſt be ſeverally dreſs'd, without making uſe of a <hi>Seton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Sore reaches the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> the <hi>Foot</hi> is eas'd. I have ſeen that Part pierc'd in two or three different places; nor is there any danger, unleſs the Sore ſpread to the <hi>Cronet,</hi> for the Pain in the Foot is abated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note;</hi> If the Sore be ſo great that 'tis neceſſary to repel the Humour to ſome other Part, the moſt convenient place that can be choſen is above the <hi>Heel</hi> in the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> becauſe there is no danger of making the Hoof fall off. And for that reaſon I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Defenſive</hi> to be apply'd only to the <hi>Toe</hi> and <hi>Side-Quarters,</hi> and not to the <hi>Heel,</hi> that of two Evils I might avoid the worſt.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of theſe Sores, you muſt be very careful to waſh the Part with <hi>Spirit of Wine, Myrrh,</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> to curb the ſpreading, or growth of the Corruption.</p>
                     <p>If the above-mention'd Remedies, tho' apply'd regularly, and continu'd for ſome Days, be not attended with the leaſt Succeſs, 'twill be very convenient to make a large opening, which will give eaſe to the Foot, and promote the Operation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. I have often ſeen the Pain conſiderably abated by this Method; for tho' the Matter may be evacuated thro' the Wound it ſelf, and the Cure perform'd without making another Hole, yet that ſeeming advantage does ſometimes retard the Cure; and it has been often obſerv'd, that ſo ſoon as a new opening was made the Horſe left off halting. When your Horſe begins to walk upright, you may dry the Sore with Powder of <hi>Allom,</hi> or ſome convenient <hi>Reſtringent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub</hi> be in a dangerous place, as at the end of the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> or at the ſide of its end, piercing to the Bone of the Foot, you muſt apply a <hi>Reſtringent</hi> round the Hoof, a piece of <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> to the Paſtern above the Heel, and a <hi>Remolade</hi> to the Sole. You muſt alſo charge the whole Leg and Thigh, if the Grief be in the Hinder-Foot, with <hi>Lees of Wine</hi> and <hi>Honey;</hi> boil the <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> and when it begins to grow hot, thicken it with Flower, then adding a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> or ſomewhat more, charge the Thigh every Day with the whole quantity heated, or with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> to ſtrengthen the Part, and prevent the falling down of the Humours, which is a neceſſary piece of caution to promote and haſten the Cure. For as ſoon as any Part is hurt, the reſt of the Parts disburthen themſelves upon it, eſpecially when there is a natural declivity or deſcent, as there is always to the lower Parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>In great Sores caus'd by <hi>Pricking</hi> with a <hi>Nail,</hi> 'tis very Expedient to give the Horſe two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in fine Powder, one day in <hi>moiſten'd Bran;</hi> and the next, to mix the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> with his <hi>Bran,</hi> letting him reſt the third Day, that Nature may not be over-loaded with an exceſſive quantity of Remedies. The fourth Day repeat the Doſe of the <hi>Liver of Antimony;</hi> the fifth give him the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:179659:299"/>intermit the ſixth, and continue in the ſame order till the Cure be perfected. Theſe <hi>Powders</hi> will contribute to diſſipate and conſume the Humours that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fall upon the Foot; and beſides, they purifie the Blood, and preſerve the Appetite.</p>
                     <p>The application of <hi>Reſtringents</hi> is alſo uſeful, tho' they may be omitted when the Sore is regularly dreſs'd with the above-mention'd <hi>Waters</hi> or <hi>Oils,</hi> which oftentimes draw forth pieces of Iron that ſtick in the Wound, and Cure almoſt all Sores that do not reach to the Bone of the Foot, or to the Sinew, without taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> tho' that Operation muſt neither be dreaded nor neglected in caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                     <p>For Example, If the <hi>Prick</hi> reach far into the Bone of the Foot, the Cure will be long and troubleſome, becauſe of the <hi>Sole</hi> that muſt be ſeparated from the Bone; and the ſureſt way is to take it quite out, tho' the Cure may be perform'd by making a large Inciſion. In ſuch caſes you muſt regulate your Proceedings by a careful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Symptoms: For Example, If the Horſe cannot ſet his Foot to the Ground, or if you perceive that he treads very ſoftly, and only upon his Toes, you muſt, without delay, take out the <hi>Sole</hi> twenty four Hours after; for if the Operation be neglected, the Matter might ſpread to the Hair, and the Pain which the Horſe ſuffers before the <hi>Sole</hi> be taken out, does almoſt always occaſion a <hi>Fever.</hi> You may alſo judge of the depth of the Wound by the length of the Nail, and when you draw it forth you may obſerve whether it enter'd ſtreight or ſloping; for even the taking out of the <hi>Sole</hi> is not always attended with the deſir'd Succeſs, when the <hi>Nail</hi> pierces very deep, and breaks the Bone of the Foot.</p>
                     <p>If the Cure of a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub</hi> be not perfected in the ſpace of ten Days, by the regular uſe of the <hi>Vulnerary</hi> Water, or the <hi>Oils de Merveille</hi> and of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi> you may certainly conclude, that either part of the <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub</hi> remains in the Foot, or that the Bone is cleft or ſhatter'd, eſpecially when you take out the Tent, if after the running out of a little Matter, there follows a great quantity of Blood, which is almoſt always a certain ſign of the approaching Separation of a Scale, if not of the falling out of the whole Bone. To leave no room for a doubt, put in your Probe and ſearch the Hole gently; and if you find that it reaches to the Bone of the Foot, you muſt immediately make a large Inciſion to eaſe the Pain, and promote the Cure, dreſſing the Wound with <hi>Sugar, Aqua-vitae,</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> and binding it up hard to prevent the growth of the <hi>Proud-fleſh;</hi> for ſo long as the Blood continues to flow abundantly, 'twou'd be in vain to apply any Ointment or Oil. At the ſecond Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſeparate all your Fleſh with your <hi>Fleam,</hi> to diſcover the bottom of the Sore, nor muſt you be ſurpris'd at the great Flux of Blood, but endeavour to ſtanch it with a hard Ligature. Continue after the ſame manner to dreſs the Sore once a Day with the above-mention'd Remedies, reſiſting the Corruption with all poſſible diligence, applying proper <hi>Remolades</hi> to the <hi>Sole,</hi> and charging the whole Leg and Thigh once a day, as before.</p>
                     <p>If the Dreſſing of the Wound be attended with a great Flux of Blood, tho' the Tents be drawn forth gently, without bending the <hi>Paſtern-Joint,</hi> I know no better Method to prevent that troubleſome ſymptom, than to put off the next Dreſſing for two Days; and if the Blood continue ſtill to flow plentifully, you muſt dreſs the Wound once more with <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> and ſuffer the Application to remain untouch'd three Days. If there happen a Flux of Blood the third time, let the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lie on four Days; and if the Blood ſtill continue to flow out, interpoſe five Days before the next Dreſſing, after which the Flux of Blood will be ſtopt, and you may dreſs the Wound every Day, or once in two Days, according to the variety of Circumſtances. I have us'd this Method with good Succeſs to ſtop the Bleeding, which hinders the Operation of the <hi>Oils, Ointments,</hi> and <hi>Powder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all Diſeaſes and Sores of the Feet, 'tis ſafer and more convenient to make an Inciſion with a <hi>Razor</hi> or <hi>Fleam,</hi> than to conſume the Fleſh with <hi>Cauteries;</hi> for beſides the Pain occaſion'd by thoſe Applications, the Matter is frequently repell'd, and lodg'd in ſome other Part as about the <hi>Paſtern;</hi> but after you have made one or two Inciſions, you have a full view of the bottom of the Sore, and may eaſily ſtop the Bleeding with <hi>Turpentine,</hi> apply'd warm with ſoft Flax, and a good Ligature; then removing the Dreſſing at the end of forty eight Hours, you will have the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of diſcovering the whole Sore, which muſt be dreſs'd and heal'd according to the above-mention'd or following Directions. Sometimes inſtead of one Hole made by the Wound, two or three break out at the ſide of the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> reaching even to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179659:300"/>Paſtern; in this caſe you muſt cut the whole Griſtle that forms the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> penetrating to the bottom of the Foot, that you may ſee the root of the Sore; for the taking out of the <hi>Sole</hi> is not always ſufficient to perfect the Cure, if the Sore reach under the end of the <hi>Fruſh</hi> to the Bone of the Foot; and therefore you muſt cut off that end, or even the whole <hi>Fruſh,</hi> to lay open the bottom of the Sore. When you have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to cut the Griſtle that forms the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> to prevent a dangerous Flux of Blood, you muſt make a ſtrong Ligature about the <hi>Paſtern</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Veins</hi> that convey the Blood to that part; after which mix a great quantity of <hi>Salt</hi> with your <hi>Digeſtive</hi> made of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Yolks of Eggs,</hi> and apply the whole to the Wound with Flax, laying over it a good <hi>black Reſtringent</hi> made with <hi>Soot, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> with Flax above all, and Splents to keep on the Dreſſing. If the Blood continue ſtill to flow from that part of the <hi>Fruſh</hi> that ends at the Heel, beſmear a little Flax with <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and apply it warm to the Part, with convenient Ligatures. Forty eight Hours after remove the Dreſſing, and you will ſee the bottom of the Sore; after which proceed as before, waſhing the Sore with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> and dreſſing it with <hi>Digeſtives, Oil of Gabian,</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> or ſome other Ointment.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Scale,</hi> or any other extraneous Subſtance left or generated in the Wound, is ſeparated from the Bone, the Horſe leaves off halting, unleſs there be more than one piece to fall away; but the <hi>Exfoliation</hi> of the Bone proceeds ſlowly, and it has been ſometimes obſerv'd, that the ſeparation of a <hi>Scale</hi> could hardly be perfected in thirty, twenty, eighteen, or fifteen Days, according to the nature of the Part. And therefore you muſt reſolve to perſiſt with Patience, which at laſt will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be crown'd with Succeſs. 'Tis true, we are ſometimes oblig'd to cut out a <hi>Scale,</hi> when it ſticks too long; for 'tis impoſſible to compleat the Cure ſo long as it remains in the Part.</p>
                     <p>The uſual Method of <hi>Farriers,</hi> for the ſeparation of a <hi>Scale</hi> from the Bone, conſiſts in the application of <hi>Digeſtives;</hi> but theſe Remedies nouriſh the Part, inſtead of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, tho' 'tis certain that the <hi>Scale</hi> never falls away till the Part be dry'd: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twou'd be better to apply ſome Powder of <hi>Sublimate,</hi> mixt with <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> which will quickly ſeparate the <hi>Scale.</hi> But the ſureſt and ſpeedieſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, when practicable, is to Sear the Bone with a hot Iron, which brings away the <hi>Scale</hi> immediately. I have alſo obſerv'd, that an equal mixture of <hi>Aloes</hi> and <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> in Powder, with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> produces the ſame effect; for the heat and ſharpneſs of the <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is temper'd by the <hi>Aloes,</hi> and the whole is render'd more effectual, and as it were enliven'd by the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which is alſo endu'd with a drying Quality.</p>
                     <p>Or, at the ſecond Dreſſing, if you perceive that there is a <hi>Scale</hi> to be ſeparated, and can apply the Remedy to the <hi>Scale</hi> it ſelf, you may mix two third parts of <hi>Opium,</hi> and one third part of <hi>Sublimate,</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and apply a little of it to the <hi>Scale,</hi> covering it with a Bolſter dipt in <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> and wrapping a <hi>Reſtringent</hi> or <hi>Defenſive</hi> about the Foot. In the mean time you muſt charge the Leg every Day, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Application to remain untouch'd for the ſpace of three Days; for the <hi>Scale</hi> will be quickly ſeparated, and open a large paſſage, which will promote the Cure.</p>
                     <p>When there is a <hi>Scale</hi> to be ſeparated from the Bone of the Foot, great care muſt be taken to prevent the growth of <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> leſt it cover the Hole that ſhould give paſſage to the <hi>Scale.</hi> And if the Fleſh be already riſen too high, you may boldly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Sublimate</hi> in Powder to conſume it: If you perceive that the firſt Application has not produc'd the intended effect, ſtrew the <hi>Proud-fleſh</hi> a ſecond time with Powder of <hi>Sublimate;</hi> after which apply <hi>Sublimate</hi> mixt with <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> to the Part, binding it on with Flax, and letting it remain four Days, if no other reaſon oblige you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it ſooner; for you muſt at leaſt allow a <hi>Cauſtic</hi> three or four Days to perform its Operation.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Scale</hi> is ſeparated you muſt not at firſt apply any Oil or Ointment to the Bone, but only a Bolſter of Flax dipt in <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> dreſſing it twice a Day till the Bone be cover'd with Fleſh; after which you may apply the moſt convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                     <p>There are <hi>Sinews</hi> and <hi>Ligaments</hi> that faſten the Bone of the Foot to the Bone call'd the <hi>Pivot</hi> or <hi>Paſtern-Bone,</hi> and the Cure is conſiderably retarded when one of theſe <hi>Sinews</hi> is prick'd. You may eaſily diſcover it, by the Swelling of the <hi>Maſter-ſinew,</hi> and in that caſe muſt immediately proceed to the taking out of the Sole, eſpecially if <hi>Red-Water</hi> run out of the Sore inſtead of Matter; or if the Matter be yellow, hard, and ſtinking, and if the Horſe keep his Foot from the Ground, all which Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179659:300"/>are certain preſages of a tedious and difficult Cure. Moſt of thoſe Pretenders to Skill who undertake to Cure Diſeas'd Horſes, are perſwaded, or at leaſt would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others, that they are Maſters of certain <hi>Ointments</hi> that infallibly Cure all <hi>Pricks</hi> and <hi>Stubbs</hi> in a Horſe's Foot, meerly becauſe they have cur'd all thoſe who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Care, which ſeldom or never amount to above five or ſix, and thoſe ſlightly Wounded, or perhaps prick'd thro' the Foot in ſome of the leaſt dangerous Parts; but when the <hi>Sinew</hi> or <hi>Tendons</hi> are hurt, the Cure requires a great deal of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Undertaker, and a nice obſervance of the exacteſt Method; nor is the beſt Ointment in the World ſufficient alone to heal the Wound. If the Nail or Stub has prick'd one of the Sinews of the Foot Bone, or the Bone it ſelf, tho' the <hi>Sole</hi> be taken out, and the very bottom of the Sore laid bare, by cutting the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and even tho' the Cure be attempted and carry'd on with the greateſt diligence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt approv'd Method, it cannot be compleated without extream dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for the ſeparation of a <hi>Scale</hi> is very troubleſome and tedious, the Wound is peſter'd with <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> and at laſt grows foul and corrupted, and (which is the worſt of all thoſe Inconveniences) the Ligaments are ſlacken'd and infeebl'd, the Bone of the Foot ſhakes as if it were ready to fall out, and ſometimes falls quite away, as I have ſeen in more than one Inſtance.</p>
                     <p>'Twou'd be needleſs to add more to convince any Man that is furniſh'd with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſtock of good ſenſe, that without taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> altering the Remedies according to the variety of Circumſtances, and ſearching to the bottom of the Sore, which is uſually very large and deep, 'tis impoſſible to apply the Medicines to the Part that ſtands moſt in need of 'em, and that conſequently they cannot help Nature to repair her great and ruinous Loſſes.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw one of thoſe Gentlemen, who, upon the credit of a very ſlender Experience, pretended confidently, that he had ſuch an excellent <hi>Ointment,</hi> that 'twas altogether needleſs to proceed to the taking out of the <hi>Sole,</hi> which he could not be perſwaded to do, tho' the Horſe had already ſuffer'd ſuch tormenting Pains for the ſpace of ten or twelve Days, that he durſt not let his Foot touch the Ground, but continu'd obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the uſe of his boaſted <hi>Ointment.</hi> At laſt he thought fit to invite me to ſee his Horſe, extolling the wonderful efficacy of his <hi>Ointment,</hi> and telling me, that he never had occaſion to take out a <hi>Sole,</hi> and that 'twas an infallible Cure for all <hi>Pricks</hi> in the Foot, but confeſt that he was extreamly ſurpriz'd at the ill Succeſs of ſo noble a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, after a conſtant application of it for ten or twelve Days. I reply'd, that if he deſign'd to preſerve his Horſe, he muſt ſuffer him to be <hi>unſol'd,</hi> which was done, and I found all the inward part of the <hi>Sole</hi> black and bruis'd, ſo that 'twas needleſs to look for any other cauſe of the Fever, that had already attack'd the Horſe. Four Days after I order'd a pretty large Inciſion to be made, to diſcover the bottom of the Sore, where I found a <hi>Scale</hi> that could not be wholly ſeparated till twenty Days after, during which time the Horſe never put his Foot to the Ground; the <hi>Scale</hi> was above an Inch long, and half a Fingers breadth broad; and I leave the Judicious Reader to determine whether it cou'd have been ſeparated without taking out the <hi>Sole,</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare the bottom of the Sore, and whether the application of the <hi>Ointment,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Manual Operation,</hi> cou'd have poſſibly ſav'd the Horſe's Life; for 'tis plain that the Cure cou'd never be perform'd ſo long as the Scale remain'd in the Foot; and that 'twou'd be ridiculous to imagine, that it cou'd have found a paſſage thro' a ſmall Hole in the Sole. I cou'd alledge many Examples I have obſerv'd in my Practice; and ſeveral <hi>Farriers</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> who have follow'd my Directions can atteſt the ſucceſsfulneſs of my Method: Not along ago a Perſon of Quality with his Infallible <hi>Ointment</hi> for <hi>Pricks in the Foot,</hi> ſuffer'd his Horſe's Foot to be ſeiz'd with a <hi>Gangrene;</hi> at laſt I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Sole to be taken out, and found the Foot <hi>Gangren'd,</hi> after which I cur'd him; but if he had not been ſeaſonably aſſiſted, he had certainly periſh'd. This is the event of thoſe magnifi'd Remedies, which are only fit to amuſe unexperienc'd Perſons; but the true Method conſiſts in a due and Judicious obſervation of the various Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that require the alteration of Medicines, and the moſt proper Seaſons for applying 'em. For when one Remedy does not ſucceed, we muſt have recourſe to another, and even take a third, if the ſecond prove ineffectual; 'tis certainly a great advantage to be Maſter of a good Remedy, but the well-tim'd Application of it is of higher Importance, and they are oftentimes both unprofitable, without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Manual Operation.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis true, ſome Horſes are leſs burthen'd with Humours than others, or are not ſo ſenſible of Pain, or are of a better Conſtitution of Body. The Seaſon of the Year is alſo to be conſider'd; for Cold is always very hurtful in this caſe, and thoſe Circumſtances contribute more effectually than the Ointments to the Cure of theſe Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>I have long endeavour'd, with a more than ordinary care and diligence, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all thoſe deſcriptions of <hi>Plaiſters</hi> and <hi>Ointments</hi> that are ſo highly extoll'd for the wonderful Cures they have perform'd; and I muſt acknowledge, that I have found 'em ſucceſsful in the Cure of ordinary Hurts, and even in Pricks that pierc'd quite thro' the Foot in the leaſt dangerous Parts, or at the <hi>Fruſh;</hi> but I have often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd 'em without the leaſt advantage to Sores that were ſeemingly leſs dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sinews or Bone of the Foot were Prick'd: So that I was forc'd to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Method already deſcrib'd in this Chapter. And to convince the Reader, that I us'd the beſt <hi>Ointments</hi> for Pricks with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall ſubjoin the deſcription of Three Compoſitions, ſelected out of a great number of others, and a <hi>Green Balſam,</hi> commonly known at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Name of <hi>Madam Feüillet's Balſam.</hi> I hope the Candid Reader will excuſe the length of this digreſſion, ſince 'twas only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Inſtruction of thoſe that are willing to be inform'd.</p>
                     <p>When, during the progreſs of the Cure, there is no neceſſity for making a large Inciſion, or cutting a great quantity of Fleſh; as ſoon as the Horſe leaves off halting, you muſt fill the Hole that was made for the conveniency of Dreſſing the Sore, with <hi>white Tallow</hi> or <hi>Candle-greaſe,</hi> preſſing it down with Flax, and ſtop the Foot with <hi>black Pitch</hi> pour'd in hot.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Retraites</hi> or pieces of Nails left in the Foot when a Nail happens afterwards to be driven in the ſame Hole, it preſſes the former piece, and thruſts it againſt the Vein, or into the <hi>Quick,</hi> which makes the Horſe halt; the Cure is the ſame with that of <hi>Pricks,</hi> and if you feel a <hi>Retrait,</hi> but cannot pull it out, you muſt take out the Sole; tho' before you proceed to ſo painful an Operation, you may try the efficacy of the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> or the <hi>Oils de Merveille,</hi> and <hi>Gabian,</hi> or the <hi>Unguentum Pompholygos,</hi> which may perhaps facilitate the drawing forth of the <hi>Retraite,</hi> as I have ſeveral times obſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen <hi>Retraits</hi> that were thruſt forwards by a Nail put into the ſame Hole, ſo that the Hoof was drawn inwards againſt the Bone of the Foot, which being naturally rough, and full of little Furrows deſign'd by Nature for its firmer union with the Fleſh that ſurrounds the Bone of the Foot, cruſh'd and bruis'd the Fleſh in that ſpace, where conſequently there was a great deal of Matter generated, that could not be wholly evacuated for a conſiderable time, nor the Part conſolidated or heal'd, and therefore the Horſe halted very long. I preſerv'd a great while the Hoof of a Horſe, where the above-mention'd caſe apear'd very diſtinctly, he cotinu'd Lame three Months of a <hi>Retrait,</hi> and ſerv'd a long time after. After his Death I deſir'd his Hoof to be brought to me, where I obſerv'd the cauſe of his Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>I will not trouble the Reader with a deſcription of <hi>Ville Magne's Ointment,</hi> tho' it be an excellent Remedy in all thoſe Caſes. You will find it deſcrib'd in all the lately Printed Books, as in the <hi>Sieur d' Epinay's Art of a Farrier,</hi> towards the End: And I ſhall only add concerning it that the <hi>Balſam of Peru,</hi> which is one of its Ingredients, is a more effectual Remedy than the whole Compoſition together. Nor have I inſerted the deſcription of <hi>Unguentum Pompholygos,</hi> which you may find in <hi>Bauderon's Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoea,</hi> and all other Diſpenſatories; and beſides hot and <hi>burning Balſams</hi> are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this caſe than <hi>Ointments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following <hi>Oil</hi> is an excellent Remedy for <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail, Stub,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XCIII. Oil <hi>of</hi> Gabian.</head>
                     <p>THis <hi>Oil,</hi> or rather <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ſwims on the ſurface of a Fountain near <hi>Beziers</hi> in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> where 'tis continually gather'd, and diſtributed to thoſe who uſe it for divers Infirmities. I have made tryal of it for <hi>Pricks</hi> with <hi>Nails</hi> and <hi>Stubs,</hi> and found it very effectual; it muſt be apply'd warm without any mixture, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication continu'd according to the Directions which you will find in the deſcription of the <hi>Oil de Merveille,</hi> and if the Sore or Wound can be poſſibly heal'd without taking out the Sole, this Oil will infallibly perform the Cure. 'Tis ſold at a low rate at <hi>Montpelier;</hi> that which is gather'd in <hi>April, May, June,</hi> and <hi>July</hi> is the beſt, and its Value proportionably decreaſes, according to the diſtance of the time when 'tis ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from <hi>May.</hi> 'Tis ſo common in that Country, that I have ſeen it burnt in Lamps; however, the ſafeſt way is to intruſt the Gathering of it to ſome honeſt and faithful Perſon who will not adulterate it. It may be rectifi'd and render'd much clearer, but in the preſent caſe there is no need of any Preparation at all.</p>
                     <p>Its Smell diſcovers the penetrating Faculty with which 'tis indu'd; and when a drop of it falls on a piece of Cloth, it can never be taken out, for it pierces thro' the ſmalleſt Threds.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a very effectual Remedy to diſſolve cold and hard Swellings, for it penetrates and diſſolves very powerfully, and by rarefying the Humours prepares 'em for Tranſpiration; and beſides, 'tis us'd inwardly, and with good Succeſs, for ſeveral Diſeaſes incident to Men.</p>
                     <p>'Tis my Opinion and Advice, that all Maſters of Horſes, eſpecially at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Streets are ſo full of Nails, ſhould never be without this Oil; but ſince thoſe who live at a diſtance from the Spring where 'tis gather'd cannot eaſily procure it, I ſhall add the deſcription of another that may be ſubſtituted in its place.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſicians of <hi>Montpelier</hi> affirm, that <hi>Gabian</hi> has all the Vertues of <hi>Petroleum,</hi> which are very numerous; and I can aſſure the Reader that it is of admirable effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in all caſes that require the application of a Remedy endu'd with a diſſolving and penetrating quality.</p>
                     <p>The Curious may find an Account of its Vertues in a <hi>Printed Bill,</hi> which is given with the <hi>Oil</hi> at <hi>Montpelier.</hi>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Oil de Merveille.</head>
                        <p>Take of <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and of <hi>St. John's-wort,</hi> of each four Ounces; true <hi>Oil of Peter,</hi> two Ounces; mix 'em in a Glaſs-Bottle over hot Embers, adding the weight of a Golden Crown of <hi>Alkanet,</hi> hung unto the Bottle by a Thred; after it has ſtood a quarter of an Hour on the Aſhes, take out the <hi>Alkanet,</hi> and preſerve the <hi>Oil</hi> for uſe.</p>
                        <p>You may thicken the <hi>Oil</hi> to the conſiſtency of a <hi>Balſam</hi> by a melting a little <hi>Wax</hi> in it; but then its penetrating Faculty will be weaken'd. When you have occaſion to apply it, inject it warm, opening the Sore that the Oil may penetrate into it, then ſtop the Hole with Cotton, to keep it open, cover it with Flax and Splents, and renew the Application every Day till the Horſe go upright.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a ſure Remedy for all <hi>Pricks</hi> with <hi>Nails</hi> or <hi>Stubs,</hi> it helps very effectually <hi>Cold Pains, Blows, Bruiſes, Strains, Cold Gout, Sciatica, Decay'd</hi> and <hi>Founder'd Legs,</hi> if it be mixt with an equal quantity of <hi>Oil of Worms,</hi> and a double quantity of <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> and 'tis alſo good for a <hi>Sprain</hi> in the <hi>Shoulders</hi> or <hi>Hips.</hi> The Vertue of Remedies conſiſts neither in quantity nor price of the Ingredients.</p>
                        <p>There are a thouſand Remedies that cure a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> in the beginning, as <hi>Turpentine</hi> alone, <hi>Tallow</hi> or <hi>Sewet,</hi> melted with <hi>Gum-Elemi, Galbanum</hi> melted with <hi>Butter</hi> or <hi>Tallow,</hi> all <hi>Balſams</hi> for Wounds, and ſeveral other Medicines.</p>

                           <hi>A</hi> Green Balſam <hi>highly eſteem'd for its excellent Virtues.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>This is that <hi>Balſam</hi> uſually known at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Name of <hi>Madam Feüillet's Balſam.</hi> It performs ſuch wonderful Cures on Men, that I thought my ſelf oblig'd to inſert it in this Book for the conveniency of thoſe who have occaſion to uſe it; but it wou'd be needleſs to deſcribe the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> that is uſually apply'd with the <hi>Balſam,</hi> ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Diapalma</hi> may be ſubſtituted inſtead of that dearer Medicine; and beſides, 'tis the <hi>Balſam</hi> alone that performs the Cure, while the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> ſeems only to keep on the Dreſſing, and hinder the Air from hurting the Sore.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Balſam</hi> is an excellent Remedy for <hi>Wounds</hi> in any part of a Horſe's Body, and for <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail, Stub,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Take of the <hi>Oils of Linſeed, Olives,</hi> and <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> of each two Ounces, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> of <hi>Chio;</hi> and (for want of that) fine common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> two Ounces; <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> one Ounce; <hi>Oil of Cloves,</hi> two Drams; <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> beaten and ſtrain'd thro' a <hi>Taffeta</hi> Searce, three Drams; <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> two Drams; put all the Ingredients into a Glaſs-Vial, mix them cold, by ſhaking the Vial from time to time, during the ſpace of a Month, and keep the <hi>Balſam</hi> for uſe.</p>
                        <p>When you dreſs a Wound the firſt time, waſh it with warm Wine, then chafe it with this <hi>Balſam,</hi> which muſt be apply'd with Lint, and cover'd with a Plaiſter; if the Wound be deep, dip your Tents in your <hi>Balſam,</hi> and lay a Plaiſter over it.</p>
                        <p>When your Horſe is hurt, dry the Wound with Flax, anoint it with the <hi>Balſam</hi> hot, then ſtrew it with the Powder of an old Rope, continuing daily after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without moiſtening the Wound, which, by this method, will be quickly heal'd in any part of the Body.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub,</hi> it muſt be apply'd as the <hi>Oil de Merveille;</hi> but ſince theſe <hi>Oils</hi> and <hi>Balſams</hi> are not ſo convenient for Carriage as <hi>Ointments,</hi> I ſhall ſubjoin ſome of the moſt approv'd Medicines in that form, beginning with one that is much celebrated, and was long kept ſecret.</p>

                        <p>Take of the <hi>Gum</hi> of a <hi>Pine-Tree,</hi> and <hi>Gum-Elemi</hi> in Powder, of each an Ounce, melt 'em in a Baſon or Pot, ſtirring them over a very gentle Fire; then add nine Ounces of <hi>Red-Wax</hi> beaten, ſtirring the Subſtances till they be throughly Incorporated; after which put in three Ounces of <hi>Venice-Turpentine,</hi> and the whole being well mixt, remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and immediately add one Ounce of <hi>Dragon's-Blood,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Long Birthwort</hi> in very fine Powder, ſtirring the mixture till it be half cold. Then pour it on a piece of Marble, or a Table rubb'd with <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> or <hi>Oil of ſweet Almonds,</hi> and having anointed your Hands with the ſame Oil, make it up into Rolls of a convenient bigneſs, wrapping them in Paper to be kept for uſe. The Ointment ought to be reddiſh if it be carefully prepar'd.</p>
                        <p>If you have no <hi>Red-Wax</hi> the Ointment may be made thus, Take of good <hi>Yellow-Wax,</hi> one Pound; <hi>Turpentine,</hi> four Ounces; <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> and <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> reduc'd to very fine Powder, on a dry Marble; melt the <hi>Wax, Turpentine,</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> ſtirring them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and after they are a little cool'd add the <hi>Cinnabar.</hi> Mix and make it up in what form you pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> which I call an <hi>Ointment,</hi> in compliance with the common way of ſpeaking, is better old than new; it may be kept thirty Years, without loſing its Virtue, and is thus apply'd.</p>
                        <p>Having laid open the Sore, melt a ſufficient quantity of the Ointment in a Spoon, with a Spoon, with a little <hi>Sewet, Greaſe, Butter,</hi> or <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> and apply it warm, continuing after the ſame manner till your Horſe be ſound.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note;</hi> That the <hi>Dragon's-Blood</hi> preſcrib'd in the Compoſition of this Ointment, is the Gum of a certain Tree found in one of the <hi>Canary</hi>-Iſlands; the Tears or Drops that diſtil from the Tree, are of a bright red Colour, and are the pureſt <hi>Dragon's-Blood,</hi> for the Gum that is drawn out of the Tree by Inciſion, is alſo call'd by the ſame Name, but is inferiour in Vertue to the former. The greateſt part is brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the goodneſs of both is judg'd by the deepneſs of their Colour. But the <hi>Dragon's-Blood</hi> uſually ſold to Farriers, ought wholly to be rejected as uſeleſs, ſince 'tis only <hi>Gum-Arabic,</hi> or ſome other common <hi>Gum</hi> diſſolv'd in Water, and ting'd with <hi>Braſil-Wood.</hi> The Gum is boil'd ſlowly till it acquire a fine Colour;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:179659:302"/>after which 'tis ſtrain'd thro' a fine Cloth, and the moiſture carefully evaporated. This Mixture is Sold to Farriers for true <hi>Dragon's-Blood,</hi> becauſe they are not willing to pay a reaſonable price for it; but it ought not to be imagin'd, that the red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour increaſes the Virtue of the common Gums, of which 'tis compos'd.</p>

                     <p>TAke <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> ſeven Pounds, and mix it in a Baſon or Skillet, with a Pound of <hi>Ceruſs,</hi> and a Pound and a quarter of <hi>Litharge</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> (for they are both equally effectual) with a Quart of Water; mix them in a large Baſon, wide above, and narrow at the bottom, or in the form of a Sugar-Loaf, and incorporate 'em Cold, ſtirring 'em with a large and ſtrong Wooden-Slice, for a quarter of an Hour; after which ſet the Veſſel over a Char-coal Fire, in a convenient Furnace, and boil the Subſtances, ſtirring 'em perpetually, till after they have boil'd upwards towards the top of the Veſſel, they begin to ſink, not by abating the heat of the Fire, which ought always to be equal and ſtrong, but by reaſon of the conſumption of the Water that kept 'em up. After they are ſunk very low, that is, after they have boil'd about an Hour and half, remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and add half a Pound of new <hi>Wax,</hi> cut into little Bits, incorporating it with the reſt, and afterwards two Pounds of the ſcrapings of an old white, and clean Linen-Cloth, beaten in a large Mortar, and ſtrain'd thro' a fine Searce; mix this with the above-mention'd Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſtirring it till it be half Cold, after which add half a Pound of fine <hi>Myrrh</hi> in Powder, and two Ounces of good <hi>Aloes,</hi> reduc'd to a very fine Powder, ſtirring all together, till you can endure to put your Hand into the Veſſel. Then having Oil'd the Table, take the Compoſition out of the Baſon with an Iron-Spoon, and make it up into Rolls, which muſt be wrapt in Paper, and kept for uſe. If the Preparation be duly made, it will be black and ſolid.</p>
                     <p>This is an admirable <hi>Plaiſter</hi> for all <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Bruiſes</hi> in Men; for it takes away the Inflammation, and Cicatrizes the Sore very ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Compoſitions ought to be call'd <hi>Plaiſters,</hi> by reaſon of their thickneſs; but ſince the Name of <hi>Ointment</hi> is better known in the World, I thought fit to retain it, notwithſtanding the Impropriety of the Expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Having found the Sore in a Horſe's Foot, melt ſome of the Ointment in a Spoon, with an equal quantity of <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> to keep it from burning, and put it hot into the Wound, with <hi>Cotton</hi> over it, continuing after the ſame manner till the Cure be perfected. This Ointment allays and takes away the Inflammation in two or three Applications, and aſſwages the Pain ſooner than any other Ointment or Oil whatſoever. It covers the Bones with Fleſh in any part of the Body, in two or three times Dreſſing, if it be mixt with an equal quantity of <hi>Oil of Roſes;</hi> and after the ſame manner 'tis alſo apply'd to Wounds. If there be occaſion for Suppuration, it draws all Impurities out of the Sore, after which you may apply a more powerful drying Ointment, or convenient Powders.</p>
                     <p>For Wounds in Horſes, mix it with a ſomewhat greater quantity of Oil or Butter, that it may be Liquid, and having wip'd the Wound with Flax, and put a little of the Ointment upon it with a Pencil, cover it gently with Flax, to preſerve it from the Air, without preſſing the Wound.</p>
                     <p>This Ointment heals the deepeſt and largeſt Wounds in a little time.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear admoniſhing the Reader, that he ought to ſet a high eſteem on this Ointment, for tho' I have try'd many, I never found one ſo effectual; the charge of the whole Doſe, or a Pound of the Ointment, amounts only to <hi>Half a Crown,</hi> and it never loſes its Virtue, it allays the Heat and Inflammation in the Wound, and even in all the Neighbouring Parts.</p>
                     <p>I have oftentimes ſeen Horſes halt above three Months after they were perfectly cur'd of <hi>Pricks</hi> with large <hi>Nails,</hi> by reaſon of their weakneſs, which was ſo great, that thoſe who had the care of 'em, were forc'd to walk 'em gently every Day in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179659:303"/>ſoft Grounds to ſtrengthen their Feet, for if they had been ſuffer'd to remain in the Stable, their Weakneſs would have continu'd much longer. This happens only when the Wound in the Foot occaſions the falling away of Scales from the Bone of the Foot, or when the Sinew is Prick'd, in which caſe the Cure is ſo tedious, that the Horſe muſt be kept in the Stable for the ſpace of five or ſix Months.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch an accident happen to a Coach-Horſe, you may make him Harrow, but as for other Horſes you muſt walk 'em in your Hand thro' till'd Grounds, and by degrees their ſtrength will return, and they will be as fit for Service as ever: But if you grow weary, and are loth to continue ſo troubleſome a Method, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe your Horſe. It happens not unfrequently, when by reaſon of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub,</hi> a Horſe remains two or three Months, without putting his Foot to the Ground when the Wound is cur'd, the Shoulder is found to be ſhrunk or dry'd, or one of the Hips ſunk lower than the other, ſo that the latter Infirmity is more dangerous than the former, ſince 'tis often abſolutely incurable, eſpecially the ſinking or falling down of one of the Hips; and therefore the ſureſt way is to charge the Shoulder to prevent theſe Diſorders.</p>
                     <p>Tho' I cannot follow the Multitude, in imagining that the Cure of theſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents depends wholly on the application of a good Ointment; yet ſince 'tis impoſſible to perform a Cure without the uſe of ſome Remedies, I ſhall ſubjoin the deſcription of another, which is reputed, and I have found to be very good, that the Reader may have the conveniency of chuſing, which he believes to be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>

                     <p>MIx half an Ounce of <hi>Camphire</hi> in Powder, with a Pint of excellent <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> put them into a large <hi>Matraſs,</hi> capable of containing three Pints, cover'd with a <hi>Veſſel of Rencounter,</hi> exactly luted on. Let the Spirit circulate in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> till the <hi>Camphire</hi> be diſſolv'd; after which take out the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> and after it is cold, unlute the <hi>Veſſel of Rencounter,</hi> and put two Ounces of <hi>Yellow-Amber</hi> beaten into the <hi>Matraſs,</hi> then fit the <hi>Rencounter</hi> on again, and place the <hi>Matraſs</hi> in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> as before, where it muſt ſtand two Days and two Nights; and after it is cold take out the <hi>Balſam,</hi> which muſt be kept in a well-ſtopt Glaſs-Vial. Obſerve that the Water in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> muſt not actually boil, but ought to be as hot as it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can be, without boiling.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Yellow-Amber</hi> that approaches neareſt to a <hi>white</hi> Colour is commonly the moſt perfect, and fitteſt for this Compoſition.</p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:179659:303"/>
                     <p>Having laid open the Hole or Wound, pour in a little of this <hi>Balſam</hi> cold, ſtop the Hole with <hi>Cotton,</hi> and renew the Application every Day till your Horſe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Sound, as he will be in a little time.</p>
                     <p>This is an excellent Remedy for decay'd and batter'd Legs, if you chaſe 'em once a Day with the <hi>Balſam</hi> cold, having firſt heated the Sinews, by rubbing 'em very hard with a wiſp of Hay. 'Tis alſo very proper for Bruiſes and cold Pains, for Sinew-Sprains and Wounds.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Balſam</hi> may be alſo us'd by Men with very good Succeſs, for it heals green Wounds as ſpeedily and effectually as natural <hi>Balſam;</hi> 'tis alſo good for Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pains in the Joints, for cold Pains, <hi>Rheumatiſms, Sciatica</hi>'s, and <hi>Strains,</hi> and generally in all other caſes for which the <hi>Queen of Hungary</hi>'s <hi>Water</hi> is commended, and even is much more effectual; nor can you find the deſcription of it in any other Book, if it be not borrow'd from this. If it be duly Prepar'd, it will be of a bright and lovely Gold colour.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Scale to be ſeparated, this <hi>Balſam</hi> will quickly bring it away, but you muſt firſt take out the Sole, and then apply the <hi>Balſam</hi> cold, till the Scale be looſen'd. <hi>Note,</hi> That by how much nearer the Scale is to the <hi>Nut</hi> or <hi>Pivot,</hi> it will require the longer time before it can be ſeparated; and therefore you muſt not blame the Remedy for the tediouſneſs of the Cure; for 'tis to be obſerv'd, that if the <hi>Nut</hi> or <hi>Pivot,</hi> that is, the Bone which is joyn'd to the Bone of the Foot, be prick'd with a Nail, or otherwiſe 'twill never throw off a Scale, and the Cure will certainly be very long, becauſe the Bone muſt be ſcrap'd to take away the blackneſs. To conclude, Experience will convince thoſe who uſe this <hi>Balſam,</hi> of its wonderful efficacy in all caſes; and even for <hi>Men,</hi> 'tis a rare Secret for <hi>Wounds, Bruiſes, cold Aches, Defluxions,</hi> &amp;c. If the curious Surgeon labour to diſcover its Virtues, with a ſufficient degree of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he will find 'em to exceed his Belief, if the Medicine be duly Prepar'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XCVI. <hi>Remedies for an</hi> Impoſthume <hi>in the</hi> Hairy <hi>part of the</hi> Foot.</head>
                     <p>SOmetimes when a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> is neglected, the <hi>Impoſthume</hi> riſes above the Hoof; for the Matter being retain'd in the Sore below, and not being able to find a Paſſage by reaſon of the hardneſs of the Sole or Hoof, it aſcends between the Bone of the Foot and the <hi>Coffin-Bone,</hi> and appears under the <hi>Cronet.</hi> This is uſually the Caſe of thoſe Horſes who have weak Feet, and is always very dangerous, becauſe the Hoof may be entirely ſeparated from the Bone of the Foot, or at leaſt the Matter may harden about the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and corrupt the Griſtle, tho' the danger be not ſo great in this caſe as in the former. And even after the Horſe is cur'd, there may remain Swellings on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> which encreaſing, may contract and dry the lower part of the Foot, to prevent which Inconveniency, you will find ſome Remedies at the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you perceive the Impoſthume, the uſual Remedy is to take out the Sole; but before you proceed to that Extremity, you may try the following Medicines, by which I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes cur'd. Theſe Swellings are more dangerous in <hi>Mules</hi> than in Horſes, becauſe they have tenderer Feet.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place you muſt pare the Foot to open a Paſſage to the Matter down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and endeavour to diſcover where it lies, by loos'ning the Sole a little from the Hoof; then dreſs the Sore with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> or, for want of that, with the <hi>burning Balſam,</hi> or the <hi>Oil de Merveille</hi> apply'd warm, charging the <hi>Cronet</hi> with a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent</hi> made of <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> mixt with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> eſpecially the Part where the Impoſthume appears, for there cannot be a more powerful <hi>Reſtringent.</hi> Or you may apply a Compoſition of <hi>Soot, Whites of Eggs,</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> to repel the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter downwards, promoting the Operation of the Remedy with a convenient Bandage.</p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:179659:304"/>
                     <p>If you pour hot <hi>Oil</hi> into the Foot, it will appear on the <hi>Cronet</hi> at the top of the Foot and ſo Cure the whole Wound, and heal it to the bottom; but if after the firſt or ſecond Application of the <hi>Reſtringent,</hi> the Hoof be not re-united to the Hairy-Skin, you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>The</hi> Counteſſes Ointment <hi>to heal and cloſe up the Sores occaſion'd by</hi> Impoſthumes <hi>in the</hi> Hairy <hi>part of the</hi> Foot.</head>
                        <p>Take half a Pint of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and a Pound of <hi>Honey;</hi> boil 'em over a very ſmall Fire in a clean glaz'd Pot, ſtirring 'em with a Slice, till the <hi>Honey</hi> be throughly heated and incorporated with the <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> then add <hi>Verdigreaſe, Gall,</hi> and <hi>Venetian-Borax,</hi> of each two Ounces, ſtrain'd thro' a fine Searce, with two Ounces of <hi>White-Vitriol</hi> beaten; boil 'em all together over a gentle Fire, ſtirring 'em till they be well incorporated, and keep the Ointment for uſe, in the ſame Pot, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
                        <p>Apply this Ointment cold on a little <hi>Cotton</hi> or <hi>Flax;</hi> and, above that, charge the whole Foot with a <hi>white</hi> or <hi>black Reſtringent.</hi> Thus the Sore will be heal'd, and the Hoof faſten'd to the Skin, after the firſt or ſecond Application.</p>
                        <p>In this caſe, the main ſcope of the Cure ſhould be to ſtrengthen and bind the upper Parts, or to drive the Matter downwards. This may be done, by applying the <hi>Ointment</hi> above, with the <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> over it, and dreſſing the Hole made in the Foot with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> the <hi>burning Balſam,</hi> or the <hi>Oil de Merveille,</hi> or of <hi>Gabian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If thoſe Cautions be neglected, the Matter will harden, and form a great <hi>Callus</hi> on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> which will occaſion the ſhrinking or drying of the Foot, by ſtopping its uſual Supplies of Nouriſhment; and if the Griſtle be infected, the Swelling will be almoſt as dangerous as the <hi>Quitter-bone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But all theſe Inconveniencies may be prevented by a ſeaſonable obſervance of the above-mention'd Directions, before the Diſeaſe grow inveterate.</p>
                        <p>If there be only a ſimple Swelling, obſerve the following Directions.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>To aſſwage and reſolve hard Swellings on the</hi> Cronet.</head>
                        <p>If the <hi>Tendon</hi> or <hi>Griſtle</hi> be Infected (as you may conclude it is, when the Probe that is put into the Hole reaches to that Part) you muſt uſe the ſame Method, as in the Cure of a <hi>Quitter-bone;</hi> but if the Infection do not reach ſo far, and there is only a hard Swelling, whether it obſtruct the Nouriſhment of the Foot or not, mix <hi>unſlak'd Lime</hi> with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or, for want of that, with <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> tho' the former is better, and apply it to the Swelling with Flax, laying a Plate of Lead over it to keep on the Dreſſing, and binding it about very hard. Repeat the Application every Day, and in three Days the Swelling will be aſſwag'd.</p>
                        <p>But if, by reaſon of the extream hardneſs of the Swelling, this Remedy prove wholly ineffectual, you muſt take out the Scale, and cleave the <hi>Fruſh</hi> to enlarge the Quarter under the Swelling; four Days after ſhave away the Hair as cloſe as you can, and heat the Part by rubbing it with the back of a Knife, or ſome other Iron Inſtrument, till the Skin grow very red without Bleeding. Then anoint it with the beſt <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> cold, with Flax and a Cloth wrapt about it, and a Bandage over all; and in the ſpace of two Days, if the Oil be good, it will raiſe little Scurfs, which you muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Skin, and take away gently. Then dreſs the Part as before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing after the ſame manner till the Swelling be diſſolv'd.</p>
                        <p>If this Remedy be not attended with Succeſs, your only refuge muſt be the <hi>Fire;</hi> and therefore you muſt pierce the Skin with a red-hot Iron, making Holes thro' the whole extent of the Swelling, at the diſtance of a Finger's breadth from each other, and half a Finger's breadth from the <hi>Cronet,</hi> extending the Holes beyond the Swelling, the breadth of half an Inch; then charge the whole burnt Part with a mixture of <hi>Turpentine, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Tarr,</hi> apply'd with Flax, and every four Days renew the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the ſame Flax till theScabs fall off; after which waſh the Sores with <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and ſtrew 'em with the Powder of <hi>old Ropes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sole</hi> muſt be taken out, and the <hi>Fruſh</hi> cleft four Days before you <hi>give the Fire,</hi> unleſs you <hi>unſol'd</hi> the Horſe fifteen Days or three Weeks before, in order to the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Oil of Bays.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:179659:304"/>
                        <p>The Powder of <hi>unſlak'd Lime</hi> that enters the Compoſition of the above-mention'd <hi>Reſtringent</hi> Remedy ought to be Prepar'd thus; put a piece of Lime on a Board, or in a Pot, and ſet it in a dry place, where it will draw in the Air and crumble to Powder, which, as I order'd before, muſt be mix'd with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or, if that cannot be procur'd, with <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> and this is certainly one of the beſt <hi>Reſtringents</hi> hitherto known.</p>
                        <p>It has been often obſerv'd, that after the taking out of the Sole for <hi>Surbating,</hi> or a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail,</hi> when the Sore ſeems to be perfectly cur'd, an Impoſthume appears above the Hoof; in which caſe you muſt apply the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> to the Sore, on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and charge the whole Foot with the above-mention'd <hi>Reſtringent;</hi> for two or three ſuch Applications will probably be ſufficient to perfect the Cure. This Remedy ought to be highly eſteem'd, for it may prevent the loſs of a Horſe's Foot, and the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> is alſo good for ſoft or frothy Soles.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XCVII. <hi>Of the</hi> Caſting <hi>of the</hi> Hoof.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HOof-caſt,</hi> or the <hi>Caſting of the Hoof,</hi> is when the <hi>Coffin-Bone</hi> falls quite away, and leaves the Bone of the Foot, faſten'd to the <hi>Pivot,</hi> or Bone of the Paſtern by the Sinews that ſurround it croſs-wiſe below, the Bone appearing to the Eye, being of a ſpongy or porous Subſtance, and cover'd with Fleſh. This is one of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effects of <hi>Pricking</hi> with a <hi>Nail,</hi> which ſometimes reaches the Sinew, and makes the Horſe Lame. Beſides, I ſaw the very Bone of the Foot fall away in two or three Pieces, having been pierc'd and broken by a Nail in the Street: Two other Horſes loſt the ſame Bone entirely on the like occaſion; and tho' they were at laſt cur'd, they remain'd Lame ever after, and only fit for the Plow, and other Work of that Nature, becauſe there was no Bone left within the Coffin. I would gladly be inform'd, whether thoſe Gentlemen that pretend to be Maſters of never-failing Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could have cur'd theſe Horſes, and prevented the falling out of the Bone, ſince I am perſwaded, that it was in a manner Dead, and no longer a natural part of the Foot. If they affirm, that they could have brought away the Bone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking out the Sole, I muſt beg leave to diſſent from them, till they convince me, that their Ointments are better, or even as good as mine, which I confeſs are not ſufficient to perform the Work, without the aſſiſtance of Manual Operation, and after all, not without a great deal of difficulty: But theſe Boaſters muſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be excus'd, ſince they never ſaw any of theſe dangerous caſes, which happen no where ſo frequently as at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe the Streets are ſo peſter'd with Dirt and Wheels.</p>
                     <p>A certain Perſon of Quality who had often tir'd me with tedious and hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Harangues in Praiſe of his <hi>infallible Ointment,</hi> deſir'd my Opinion of his Horſe's Foot that was prick'd with a Nail in the Street, and cou'd not be cur'd by his boaſted Remedy. I order'd a large Inciſion to be made, and immediately perceiv'd that the Bone of the Foot was hurt, and that there was a Scale to be ſeparated, which I dreſt with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> and quickly cur'd the Sole.</p>
                     <p>After this Accident, the Receipt of the Ointment, that had till then been kept ſo ſecret, was freely communicated to a great number of Perſons; which is the uſual Fate of thoſe magnify'd Remedies, when they fall into the hands of Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I acknowledge this Digreſſion is ſomewhat long, but may, perhaps, ſerve to undeceive ſome of thoſe who imagine, that no Diſeaſe is able to reſiſt the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy of a boaſted <hi>Secret.</hi> The <hi>Strasburg Ointment, Frankfort Pills, Orvietan,</hi> and all the famous Secrets are at laſt brought to light; and, for my part, I never ſcruple to communicate all that I know to the Publick; and this freedom is ſo far from depriving me of the uſe of the <hi>Secrets</hi> which I impart, that it ſecures me againſt Miſtakes, ſince I can always have recourſe to the Book, where I find them fully deſcrib'd.</p>
                     <p>Of Horſes who caſt their Hoofs few eſcape irrecoverable Lameneſs, and generally they may be turn'd away as uſeleſs, ſince before the Hoof can be renew'd, the charge of the Cure amounts to more than their Value, eſpecially at <hi>Paris,</hi> and after all, they are hardly fit for Service; but if you reſolve to attempt the Cure, and try
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179659:305"/>the ſucceſs of the beſt Remedies, I muſt acknowledge that I know no better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, than that which is preſcrib'd by <hi>Signior Carolo Ruini,</hi> in his Book, Entitul'd, <hi>Infirmita Del Cavallo;</hi> and after him by <hi>Philippo Scacco,</hi> in his Treatiſe, <hi>Di Meſcalzia,</hi> Printed at <hi>Venice.</hi> I have nothing to add to what thoſe Gentlemen have ſaid on this Subject, eſpecially the former; only I think my ſelf oblig'd to declare, that I have always obſerv'd the charge of the Cure to exceed the value of the Horſes; and that, after all, they were only fit to be imploy'd in Tilling the Ground. Nevertheleſs, ſince there are ſome fine Horſes whom a Man would not willingly loſe, without try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſucceſs of the beſt Methods, and who may ſerve for <hi>Stallions</hi> if they be not Gelt; for the general ſatisfaction of my Readers, I thought fit to ſubjoin the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an excellent Ointment to reſtore the Hoof, which I can confidently recommend as very effectual, if it be duly apply'd, and the uſe of it continu'd for a conſiderable time.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Schmit<hi>'s Ointment.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take half a Pound of <hi>Roſin,</hi> and a Pound of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> melt them in a Copper-Baſon Tinn'd, and a quarter of an Hour after you remove the Veſſel from the Fire, add <hi>Maſtic</hi> and <hi>Olibanum,</hi> in Powder, of each an Ounce and half; ſtir the Ingredients together about half a quarter of an Hour, and then add half a Pound of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> continuing to ſtir a little longer, to incorporate the whole.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time take half a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> and half a Pint of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> boil them gently till they begin to Smoak, not forgetting to ſtir them; then add <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe</hi> and <hi>Copperas,</hi> in very fine Powder, of each three Ounces, ſtirring and boyling till all the Subſtances be United, and as ſoon as the Mixture is half cold pour it into the firſt Baſon where the Oyl is, which ought to be half cold alſo. Mix 'em together, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately add two Ounces of <hi>Burnt Allom</hi> in fine Powder, one Ounce of <hi>Orpiment,</hi> ſtirring and mixing 'em with the reſt, and as ſoon as they are all incorporated, add flower of <hi>Linſeed</hi> and <hi>Fenugreek,</hi> of each three Ounces, ſtirring the Maſs till it be almoſt cold; at laſt add two Ounces of <hi>Aloes</hi> in fine Powder, ſtirring till it be incorporated with the reſt of the Ointment, which will then be compleated, and muſt be kept in a Pot. Its Colour is not much different from that of <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> and if the above-mention'd Directions concerning the different times of boiling, and the fineneſs of the Powders be carefully obſerv'd, you will find that its Virtues are not much inferiour to thoſe of the <hi>Strasburg-Ointment,</hi> and perhaps 'tis the ſame that Mr. <hi>Floch,</hi> the <hi>Strasburg</hi> Farrier, us'd to ſell in Tin-Boxes to Travellers; however, 'tis certain, that it has the ſame uſe, and produces very good effects.</p>
                        <p>This Ointment cleanſes, reſiſts Corruption, heals, and makes a fine Cicatrice, and this alone may ſerve to cleanſe the greateſt Wounds, to ſeparate a Felander, or any other extraneous Body, and draw them out of a Sore; mix the Ointment with an equal quantity of Sugar, and apply it cold with a Bolſter of Flax. The ſame Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is convenient when one of the quarters of the Hoof is cut away.</p>
                        <p>Since the Hoof does not always fall quite away at once, but by degrees, and uſually after conſiderable Intervals; you muſt apply this Ointment cold to all the ſore and raw Parts, and if the Fleſh grow too faſt, or appear frothy, burn the higheſt part of it, and then apply the Ointment.</p>
                        <p>This Ointment is alſo very proper for Wounds in the <hi>Withers,</hi> and in all other parts of the Body; for it keeps 'em very clean, and prevents a <hi>Gangrene.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe who carry Trains of Horſes to the Army, or Travel with a great number of Horſes, ſhould always make proviſion of a ſufficient quantity of this Ointment; and if Farriers had it in their Shops, they would daily make new diſcoveries of its Virtues, and lay aſide the uſe of the <hi>Unguentum Apoſtolorum,</hi> and all drying Powders. The Application of this Ointment after the uſe of an actual or potential Cautery; and after the Scabs are fall'n off, is a preſent Remedy for all <hi>Quitter-bones,</hi> whether they proceed from outward or inward Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>It may be call'd an excellent kind of <hi>Aegyptiacum;</hi> and very effectually reſtores and ſtrengthens the <hi>Sole,</hi> when the ſuperfluous Moiſture of the Fleſh hinders its Growth.</p>
                        <p>You may cure watry or running Sores in young Coach-Horſes, by ſhaving off the Hair and applying this Ointment daily. The ſame may be alſo us'd in the Cure of <hi>Pricks</hi> or <hi>Stubs,</hi> but there are other Ointments more effectual in that caſe.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:179659:305"/>
                        <p>In the general 'tis good and uſeful in all thoſe caſes, in which the <hi>Strasburg Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is us'd. Only you muſt not adminiſter it, for a purge, as <hi>Floch</hi> was wont to do at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> tho' he had not the confidence to give that Advice to any but <hi>Switzers.</hi> Some Horſes caſt one or two of the Quarters of the Hoof, ſome part of it remaining entire, which helps to ſtrengthen and ſupport the growing Hoof; but ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents leave always ſo remarkable a defect in the Foot, that unleſs it be a Horſe of great Value, and you reſolve never to ride him but on ſoft Ground in a <hi>Manage,</hi> the Cure can never be perfected to the ſatisfaction of the Owner, eſpecially if the Horſe caſt the third part, or one half of his Foot. 'Tis true, a regular Application of this Ointment will at laſt perform the Cure, but it is always attended with the above-mention'd defect.</p>
                        <p>When part of the Hoof is cut off, for the Cure of <hi>Quitter-bones, Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail,</hi> and ſuch like Diſtempers, you muſt obſerve the Method preſcrib'd in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe.</p>
                        <p>A diligent peruſal of this Chapter will undeceive thoſe who imagine, that the taking out of the Sole, and caſting of the Hoof is the ſame thing; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are always wont to reject a Horſe whoſe Sole has been taken out: For the taking out of the Sole by a skilful Hand, does not at all leſſen the Value of a Horſe; whereas thoſe who have caſt the Hoof, are never afterwards able to endure Fatigues.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XCVIII. <hi>Of</hi> Bleymes.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ABleyme</hi> is an Inflammation caus'd by extravaſated Blood within the <hi>Coſſin-bone,</hi> between the Sole and the Bone of the Foot towards the Heel, where it turns to Matter, and occaſions thoſe Diſorders that ſhall be particularly mention'd in this <hi>Chapter.</hi> There are three ſorts of <hi>Bleymes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt are generated in ſpoil'd and wrinkl'd Feet, with Narrow-Heels, and are uſually ſeated in the inward or weakeſt Quarter. <hi>Manag'd</hi> Horſes are moſt ſubject to this Infirmity, becauſe their Feet are extreamly dry'd with the Duſt, if they be not carefully Pick'd after they return from the <hi>Manage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper makes the Horſe halt extreamly, and if it be neglected, we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently oblig'd to make a large Inciſion, or to take out the Sole. And therefore as ſoon as you perceive your Horſe to be troubl'd with it, you muſt pare the Hoof, and open the <hi>Bleyme</hi> to the Quick, to let forth the Matter, which is almoſt always of a brown Colour; then pour in <hi>Oil of Gabian,</hi> or <hi>De Merveille,</hi> or the <hi>burning Balſam,</hi> Charging the Hoof with a <hi>Remolade</hi> made of <hi>Soot</hi> and <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and continuing after the ſame manner, by which means the Impoſthume will not reach the Hair, as it would certainly do, if there were not a paſſage open'd for the evacuation of the Matter. But if you perceive an Impoſſible above the Hoof, obſerve the Method preſcrib'd in the preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> applying the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> as above, or if that cannot be procur'd, mix Powder of <hi>Litharge</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and apply it to the place with Flax. Sometimes this Diſtemper is ſo dangerous, that it occaſions the <hi>Caſting of the Hoof;</hi> for by reaſon of the long ſtagnating of the Matter, Felanders, and other Impurities are generated, that conſume and putrifie the root of the Quarter, which muſt be cut off to the <hi>Gronet.</hi> And if the Cure be not perfected by that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, to proceed Methodically, having open'd the Sole over-againſt the griev'd Part, you muſt put in your Probe at the corner of the Quarters to ſearch the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity and bottom of the Sore. If you find nothing but Corruption, you muſt make a large Inciſion with your <hi>Fleam</hi> or <hi>Razor,</hi> to let forth the Matter, and diſcover the bottom of the Sore; but if there be no Scale, or any other Impurity in it, dreſs the Hole, as if it were occaſion'd by a <hi>Prick</hi> with a <hi>Nail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe <hi>Bleymes</hi> you muſt keep your Horſe's Feet clean and moiſt, making him ſtand five or ſix Hours every Day with his Fore-feet in his own Dung, moiſten'd with Water. It will be alſo convenient when he is Shod to knock down the Heel, that the Sinew may be extended, for 'tis uſually crooked in thoſe Horſes that have great Heels; and beſides, the ſame caution will prevent the Contraction and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179659:306"/>of the Heels, for the <hi>Bleymes</hi> are almoſt always occaſion'd by the ſhrinking of the inſide of the Hoof, to prevent which Inconveniency, if that part of the Hoof be already ſhrunk, pare the Foot and ſet on a <hi>Pantofle-Shooe;</hi> and if your Horſe be very much <hi>Hoof-bound,</hi> draw three or four Lines with a hot Iron on the Hoof, from the lower part of the Cronet to the Shooe, and keep the inſide Quarter very ſupple and moiſt. I have ſeen Horſes forc'd to ſtand eight or ten Days in Litter, by reaſon of this Infirmity, the preventing of which will ſave a great deal of Charge to their Maſters.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort, beſides the uſual ſymptoms of the firſt, infects the Griſtle, which muſt be extirpated, as in the Cure of a <hi>Quitter-bone.</hi> This kind of <hi>Bleyme</hi> is infinitely more dangerous than a <hi>Quitter-bone,</hi> for many Horſes are kill'd by it, others remain for ever Lame, and ſome eſcape after a long and tedious Cure. 'Tis ſometimes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by an <hi>Over-reach,</hi> which, without making any outward Wound, makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion within, and the bruis'd Blood turns to Matter, which, ſeeking a paſſage, infects the Griſtle, and being retain'd, grows to a <hi>Scirrhous</hi> Lump, which muſt be taken out below, and the Griſtle above, and the Sore cur'd by the Remedies already propos'd in a like caſe.</p>
                     <p>During the Cure, inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> give your Horſe <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> every Day, to divert the courſe of the Humours, and purifie the Blood.</p>
                     <p>You may conſult the <hi>Chapter</hi> that contains the Method of Cure for <hi>Quitter-bones,</hi> where you will find the Remedies that are proper in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort of <hi>Bleymes</hi> is occaſion'd by ſmall Stones and Gravel, enclos'd between the Shooe and the Sole; but this kind may be eaſily cur'd.</p>
                     <p>If the Shooe be ill ſet on, or not kept faſt by the Nails, the Horſe is in danger either of <hi>Surbating,</hi> or of the <hi>Bleymes;</hi> and thoſe who have flat Feet are moſt ſubject to this Infirmity, becauſe the Sand or Gravel enters eaſily between the Sole and the Foot.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure you muſt pare the Foot, to diſcover the Sore; and if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there is no Matter generated, take out the bruiſed Sole; but if the Matter be already gather'd, let it out, and dreſs the Sore like a Prick with a Nail.</p>
                     <p>If the Cure be ſeaſonably attempted, it will be quickly perfected; but if you find that the Diſtemper has already gather'd ſtrength, you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> the <hi>burning Balſam,</hi> the <hi>Oils De Merveille</hi> and of <hi>Gabian.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Cure depends on the evacuation of the Matter below; the neglect of which might be attended with very troubleſome Conſequences.</p>

                     <p>SOmetimes the <hi>Fruſh</hi> falls away by degrees, by reaſon of an <hi>Eating Scab</hi> which pierces to the Quick, and occaſions ſo great an Itching that the Horſe cannot walk without halting; but theſe Sores are not ſo dangerous as they are troubleſome and painful. Before the Horſe grows Lame his Feet ſtink of old rotten Cheeſe, ſo that you may eaſily diſcover the nature of the Grief, ſince 'tis impoſſible to come into the Stable without perceiving the Smell. And beſides, they beat the Ground from time to time with their Feet, by reaſon of the intolerable Itching in thoſe Parts.</p>
                     <p>To begin the Cure you muſt pare the <hi>Fruſh</hi> with your <hi>Buttreſs</hi> as near as you can, then quench a ſufficient quantity of <hi>unſlak'd Lime</hi> in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> ſtrain out the Liquor, boil it, and throw it boiling hot on the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> after which apply a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> of Powder of <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> mixt with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or the <hi>black Reſtringent</hi> made of <hi>Soot, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs.</hi> The <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> is very uſeful in this caſe, for it performs the Cure in three or four Applications; but the Dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

All the Ointments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for running Sores or putrify'd Legs, are alſo good in this caſe.</p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:179659:306"/>
                     <p>For Preſervation, you muſt often pare the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and rub the Place once or twice with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> which will conſume part of the Corruption, and dry up the root of the <hi>Scabs</hi> ſo effectually, that they will not break forth again for a long time after. Then bathe the Part every Day with the following Water cold; Take of <hi>Allom</hi> and <hi>white Vitriol,</hi> of each a Pound and a half; boil 'em in a Gallon of Water till it be reduc'd to two Quarts. At laſt, when you perceive the Itching gone, melt <hi>Tarr</hi> or <hi>Black Pitch</hi> upon the Scabs, and keep the Feet well pick'd, and free from Duſt, or any other Ordure that might dry 'em.

                     <head>CHAP. C. <hi>Of the</hi> Crown-Scab.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Crown-Scab</hi> is a white or mealy Scurf caus'd by a burnt, yellow, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Matter that breaks forth at the roots of the Hair where it ſticks to the Skin, and makes the Hair briſtle and ſtare, and at laſt Scalds it quite off. You may diſtinguiſh the Nature of the Diſtemper by the briſtling of the Hair on the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and not unfrequently on the whole <hi>Paſtern</hi> to the Joint. The place is cover'd with a mealy Scurf, and the <hi>Cronet</hi> ſwoll'n by the abundance of Humours that fall upon the Part. The moſt ſubtle Particles of thoſe Humours exhaling thro' the Pores of the Skin harden into a kind of <hi>Salt</hi> that ſticks to the Skin and produces the Scurf which uſually appears on the <hi>Cronet.</hi> There are two ſorts of <hi>Crown-Scabs:</hi> Some are dry without the leaſt humidity, and others are moiſt by reaſon of a ſtinking Water that Iſſues out of the Pores, and communicates its ſtench and moiſture to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts. Beſides, at the beginning of the Foot under the <hi>Cronet,</hi> the ſurface of the Hoof is crack'd and ſplit by the drineſs and acrimony of the Humour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the <hi>Cronet,</hi> from whence the Hoof receives its Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall have occaſion to treat of this Diſtemper in that part of this Work that contains Inſtructions for the curing of Horſes. In the mean time it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that it is neither painful nor makes 'em unfit for Travelling, unleſs in moiſt Countries; for in dry Climates it dries up in the Summer without the Application of any Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, the Humour that breeds the Scurf is ſometimes ſo hot and ſharp, that the Horſe is extreamly prejudic'd by it; and even ſometimes the Scab over-runs the whole Leg almoſt to the Knee and Hoof. The common drying Remedies ſerve only to palliate the Evil which returns after a ſeeming Cure; and even after 'tis dry'd up, may continue ſtill to caſt forth a Scurf that ſticks to the Hair, and muſt be every Day rubb'd off with a <hi>Curry-comb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Drying</hi> Remedy may be thus prepar'd, take two Ounces of good <hi>Braſil Tobacco</hi> cut ſmall, or at leaſt ſeparated from the Stalks, and infuſe it twelve Hours in half a Pint of ſtrong <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> ſtirring 'em every Hour that the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> may pene rate its Subſtance, and wholly extract its Tincture. Then chafe the <hi>Scab</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking off the Skin, and afterwards rub 'em very hard with a handful of the Tobacco, continuing to rub 'em after the ſame manner once every Day. If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the uſe of this Remedy the Scratches are not dry'd, or break forth again after an imperfect Cure, uſe that which follows.</p>
                     <p>Rub the Part with a Wiſp of Hay till it grow hot, but without fleying off the Skin, or drawing Blood; then touch it gently with <hi>Cotton</hi> dipt in the <hi>Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> repeating the Application the ſecond time, if the firſt be not ſufficient. Or dreſs the Sores with the <hi>Neat-herd's Ointment,</hi> which you will find deſcrib'd in the hundred fifty ſeventh <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had once a young <hi>Barbe,</hi> who was troubl'd with a <hi>Crown-Scab</hi> not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the <hi>Pains</hi> or <hi>Red-Water</hi> in the Legs, for it was very moiſt; and in order to the Cure of ſo troubleſome an Infirmity, I apply'd too large a quantity of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> which was better rectify'd, and ſtronger than I imagin'd. Immediately the Sinew and the whole Leg ſwell'd, and the Swelling was accompany'd with ſo violent a Pain, that the Horſe could not ſtand upright; ſo that I was forc'd to have recourſe to the <hi>Red-Honey-Charge,</hi> to aſſwage the Pain of the Leg, and eſpecially the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179659:307"/>Sinew. And to the Place where the Scab appear'd, which was extreamly tormented with the Acrimony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> I apply'd the <hi>white Honey-Charge</hi> which allay'd the Pain; but ſhortly after the whole <hi>Cronet</hi> fell off. Yet the Fleſh and Skin were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtor'd and the Sores heal'd; but there was a great Scar left which was never afterwards cover'd with Hair. In the mean time the Horſe was abſolutely cur'd of the <hi>Crown-Scab,</hi> but by reaſon of the violent Effects of the Remedy, he was forc'd to be kept two Months in the Stable. This Example may ſerve to admoniſh the Reader of the Danger of applying too large a quantity of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> eſpecially if it be good; for that which is uſually ſold at <hi>Paris</hi> is not ſo ſtrong; and 'tis ſafer to renew the Application two or three times, than to endanger the Horſe by an over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd quantity at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> produces the ſame effect, and the Experience I have had of its Nature inclines me to prefer it before the other, for it cleanſes more powerfully. The following Remedy is ſometimes ſufficient for the Cure of the <hi>Crown-Scab.</hi> Infuſe a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> that is, as much <hi>Salt</hi> as the <hi>Spirit</hi> will diſſolve; for as ſoon as you perceive the <hi>Salt</hi> to lie at the bottom, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſatiated. Then rub the Part and bathe it with the impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of an inveterate <hi>Crown-Scab</hi> is often attempted without Succeſs; for the <hi>Spirits of Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> are not infallible Remedies in this caſe; and 'tis frequently obſerv'd, that larger Sores are more eaſily cur'd than this Scab, eſpecially ſuch as are old and malignant.</p>

                     <p>BEſides the Sores occaſion'd in the <hi>Fruſh</hi> by <hi>Pricks</hi> and <hi>Stubs, Scabs,</hi> and <hi>Figgs,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fleſhy Lumps or Excreſcencies ariſe at the ſide of the Part about the bigneſs of ſmall Nuts, which are occaſion'd by the heat of the Feet or Stable, and are not dangerous, tho' ſometimes very painful. Some ignorant Perſons confound theſe with the <hi>Figgs,</hi> which are nouriſh'd and fomented by a corrupt, nervous, or ſinewy Juice, which is the cauſe of their Malignity; and beſides, they are oftentimes faſten'd to the Griſtle, whereas the Excreſcencies, which are the Subject of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> proceed only from an exceſs of Heat, ſo that the Diſeaſe is ſympathetical, not eſſential to the Part, and therefore infinitely leſs dangerous, tho' it often makes the Horſe halt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, and if neglected might produce very troubleſome Conſequences. And even ſometimes, tho' very rarely, the Sole muſt be taken out before the root of the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling can be extirpated; but generally theſe Tumours are as eaſily Cur'd as known.</p>
                     <p>When you perceive a Lump or <hi>Excreſcency</hi> of live Fleſh faſtn'd to the ſide of the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> which uſually makes the Horſe halt, and oftentimes right-down, if it be ſeated on one of the Hinder-Legs, large and high above the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> you muſt immediately cut it off with a red-hot Knife, ſear the Part to ſtop the Blood, and dreſs the Sore with the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment,</hi> or for want of that with the Powders of <hi>Crude Allom, Galls,</hi> and <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> equally mixt, and apply'd with a Bolſter of Flax, laying over it, and over the whole <hi>Fruſh</hi> and <hi>Sole</hi> a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> made of <hi>Turpentine, Soot,</hi> and <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> boyl'd gently, and incorporated with perpetual ſtirring. Three Days after take off the Dreſſing, and touch the Part with <hi>Spirit of Vitriol;</hi> after which renew the Application as before, and, by a careful obſervance of this Method, the Cure will be ſpeedily perfected.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes, after a regular Application of the above-mention'd Remedies, the Swelling returns, and muſt be again cut off with a red-hot Knife; after which apply the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment,</hi> and when you remove the Dreſſing waſh the Part with <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> then dreſs it with the <hi>Ointment,</hi> and continue after the ſame manner till the Sore be heal'd. In the menn time, to promote the Cure, by cleanſing, drying, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179659:307"/>ſtrengthning the Part, you may touch it with <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and apply <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> with the uſual Dreſſing of Bolſters, Bandage, or Splents.</p>
                     <p>It may ſometimes happen that all theſe Remedies will not be ſufficient to prevent the return of the Tumour; in which caſe you muſt pluck off the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> and dreſs the Part, according to the Directions mention'd in the <hi>Chapter</hi> that treats of the <hi>Figgs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Horſe halt right-down, apply only the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment,</hi> dreſſing it once in two Days, and perſiſting in the uſe of that Remedy till he begin to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Sometimes thoſe Bunches or Excreſcencies appear at the end of the <hi>Fruſh</hi> on the Hinder-Legs, and are ſo painful that the Horſe treads on his Toes, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure to ſtand or walk; but you muſt not be ſurpriz'd, nor dread the Event, ſince you may eaſily make him ſound, by dreſſing the Part once in two Days with the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cleft of the <hi>Fruſh</hi> is ſometimes Impoſthumated by reaſon of the heat of the Stable, ſo that a Horſe halts right-down, and the Matter, mixt with red-Water, falls upon the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> neither is this caſe more dangerous than the former, notwithſtanding the Pain and Lameneſs with which it is attended; for the Cure may be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd after this manner. In the firſt place, cleanſe the Part by thruſting a <hi>Slice</hi> or <hi>Spatula</hi> wrapt about with Flax, and repeating the ſame ſo often till no Moiſture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Flax; then put a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Second Water</hi> into the Cleft, and ſtop it with Flax moiſten'd in either of theſe Liquors, proceeding after the ſame manner till the Symptoms diſappear.</p>

This Plant grows, during the Summer, at the ſides of Hollow-ways in Mountainous Places, its Leaves are long and notch'd, and the Country People make uſe of it to deſtroy the Lice that trouble their Cattle.</p>
                        <p>The following Remedy is alſo very good, and certainly Cures the <hi>Mange,</hi> if the Part be twice rubb'd with it; take <hi>Green Copperas</hi> and <hi>Burnt Allom,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Arſmart,</hi> two handfuls; boil 'em in two Quarts of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> to the Conſumption of one half; and rub the Horſe's Legs with a Wiſp, before you waſh 'em with the Liquor.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the Skin and Hair peels off at the bending of the Thigh, and the place remains bare and red, denoting an exceſs of Heat. Take four Ounces of the <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony,</hi> beat 'em to Powder, and boil 'em in two Quarts of ſtrong <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> with which rub the raw Part every Day till the Hair return.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Remedy is of great efficacy for the Cure of the <hi>Mange</hi> on the Legs, and all other parts of the Body, if they be often rubb'd with it. It cures infallibly the <hi>Univerſal Mange,</hi> if at the ſame time the Horſe's Body be cool'd with repeated Doſes of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> or inſtead of that with <hi>Cryſtal Mineral,</hi> or <hi>Sal Prunellae.</hi> 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Cure of this Diſtemper muſt always be begun with Bleeding, and in the mean time the Horſe may be either ridden or wrought.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HOrſes are ſubject to many Diſeaſes in their <hi>Feet, Hips, Hams, Fetlock-Joints, Paſterns,</hi> and other parts of their Legs that obſtruct the conveyance of the uſual ſupplies of nouriſhment to the Feet; which are conſequently waſted, dry'd up, ſhrunk, and in a little time grow ſo little that they are in a manner wholly uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Diſeaſe are not obſcure; for the Foot appears ſmaller to the Eye, and ſounds hollow if you knock on the Hoof; and beſides, the Horſe uſually halts.</p>
                     <p>To cure the <hi>Hoof-bound,</hi> raſe the whole Foot with a red-hot Knife, as if it were a <hi>Rape,</hi> or <hi>Drawing-Iron,</hi> making large Raſes of the depth of a <hi>Silver-Crown,</hi> from the Hair to the Shoe, without appoaching too near the <hi>Cronet;</hi> after which charge the whole Foot with the following <hi>Remolade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this effect of the <hi>Fire,</hi> ſo ſeemingly contrary to its nature, depends on its penetrating and ſoftning the Hoof, for immediately the Bone of the Foot that was extreamly ſtraiten'd by the Hoof, or at leaſt by one of the <hi>Quarters,</hi> reſumes its place; and beſides, the <hi>Remolade</hi> penetrates the Hoof more eaſily than when 'tis ras'd by the <hi>Drawing-Iron,</hi> which weakens the Hoof inſtead of ſtrengthning it.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>A</hi> Pultiſs.</head>
                        <p>Take two parts of <hi>Sheep's-Dung,</hi> and one part of <hi>Hen's-Dung,</hi> boil 'em with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> to the thickneſs of Paſte or Dough.</p>
                        <p>In another Pot boil a convenient quantity of <hi>Mallows</hi> to a Maſh, then add as much Powder of <hi>Linſeed</hi> as ſuffices, and boil a little longer; after which beat 'em in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, with an eighth part of a raw <hi>Garlick</hi> to a ſoft Paſte, which you muſt incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the former, adding a little <hi>Oil of Lillies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having par'd the Foot, put ſome of the <hi>Pultiſs</hi> into it, covering it with Splents, and charge the Foot with the following <hi>Remolade</hi> luke-warm, renewing the Application five or ſix times once in two Days, and always obſerving to heat the old <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> and only mix a little freſh with it. If you perceive any effect of theſe Remedies, you may lay aſide the <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> if otherwiſe, you muſt perſiſt in the uſe of it, and always apply it very hot.</p>
                        <p>'Tis confirm'd by frequent Obſervations, that one of the <hi>Quarters</hi> of the Hoof may be ſhrunk and dry'd up, while all the Nouriſhment falls upon the other. The ſeat of this Infirmity is uſually near the Heels of the Fore-Feet, and the inſide of the Hoof, which is the weakeſt part; and the Horſe halts right-down, becauſe the Bone of his Foot is too much ſtraightn'd, and preſt by the ſhrunk Quarter.</p>
                        <p>Draw ſeven or eight Lines with a hot Iron upon the ſhrunk <hi>Quarter</hi> from the <hi>Cronet</hi> to the Shooe, without touching the Hair; put the above-mention'd <hi>Pultiſs</hi> into the Foot, dreſſing it with Splents as before, and apply to the <hi>Quarter</hi> a <hi>Remolade,</hi> made of half a Pound of <hi>Burgundy-Pitch,</hi> four Ounces of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> two Ounces of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> and a ſufficient quantity of fine Flower to thicken the whole, continuing to lay on freſh <hi>Remolade</hi> luke-warm every Day till the Hoof be ſoften'd, and recover its natural ſhape, and the Horſe be freed from his Lameneſs.</p>
                        <p>If after all the Hoof, eſpecially the inſide <hi>Quarter,</hi> remain ſtill ſhrunk, you muſt take out the <hi>Sole,</hi> and cleave the <hi>Fruſh</hi> in the middle with a <hi>Fleam,</hi> piercing to the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> fill the Cleft with a great number of Bolſters, beſmear'd with a mixture of equal parts of <hi>Tar, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Turpentine</hi> boil'd together, obſerving in the mean time, that the Bolſters muſt not be put into the <hi>Fruſh</hi> till the Foot be dreſs'd, and the Splents laid on; after which the Cleft muſt be fill'd with the Bolſters, which will produce a better effect, than if they were put into the Foot; for the Cleft will be kept wide, the ſhrunk <hi>Quarter</hi> reſtor'd; and at laſt a new Sole will ſtrengthen and ſupport it, if the Shooe be carefully ſet on.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CIII. <hi>Of</hi> Wounds.</head>
                     <p>THere are ſome <hi>Wounds</hi> ſo ſlight, that the Cure conſiſts only in keeping them clean; and there are others ſo painful, that the neglect of 'em is always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the utter ruine of the Horſe, whereas if they be carefully dreſs'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt Method, they neither leſſen his Beauty nor Goodneſs: I make no mention of Mortal Wounds, ſince it would be an uſeleſs waſte of Time to attempt the Cure of 'em. To proceed regularly, you muſt in the firſt place conſider diligently the nature of the Wound, and whether it was made with <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Sword,</hi> or with a <hi>Bullet.</hi> 'Tis alſo to be obſerv'd, that Wounds in the Fleſh are more eaſily cur'd, than thoſe that break or bruiſe the Sinews, Tendons, or Bone, eſpecially if they be in a Joint, where they are ſeldom or never Curable: Nor would I adviſe any Man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Cure of a Horſe ſhot thro' the Body with a Muſquet-Bullet, ſince the Event is always uncertain, and the Charges extreamly great. Wounds are very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome in hot Weather, becauſe the Flies or other Inſects breed a Corruption in 'em, which is often attended with fatal Conſequences, ſuch as a Gangrene or Mortification; and tho' cold Weather be free from that Inconveniency, it retards the Cure, and hinders the cloſing of the Wound. The old and uſual Method of Cure is ſo tedious, that it will not be improper to ſpend ſome time in the conſideration of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to propoſe certain Maxims on which the true way of proceding in theſe Caſes is grounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then it muſt be conſider'd, that a Horſe's Fleſh is extreamly ſubject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to grow foul upon the leaſt Contuſion, which obſtructs and prolongs the Cure of a Wound, ſince the corrupted Fleſh muſt be ſeparated and fall away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wound can be clos'd. 'Tis plain from this Maxim, that a Wound muſt be prob'd very gently, and as ſeldom as poſſible; the <hi>Probes</hi> of <hi>Aromatick</hi>-Wood, ſuch as <hi>Juniper</hi> or <hi>Roſemary,</hi> that are us'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> are certainly very good, but they muſt be prepar'd long before you uſe 'em, that they may have time to dry.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are made of <hi>Silver</hi> are beſt for deep Wounds, and thoſe of <hi>Lead</hi> may be put into <hi>Setons,</hi> inſtead of the Strings that are commonly us'd for that purpoſe, for <hi>Lead</hi> never heats the Part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>Wound</hi> muſt be always kept clean, and freed from corrupt Fleſh, which muſt be conſum'd with Powders. The <hi>Proud-Fleſh</hi> muſt be kept down with Bandages, eſpecially if it be not firm, and if the Situation of the Part be convenient; or if that Method be impracticable, it may be either burnt or conſum'd with Powders. If the <hi>Wound</hi> be not too near a Bone, you muſt not be afraid of eating too deep, or cutting away too much of the naughty Fleſh, provided you neither cut a Sinew nor Tendon; for a Horſe's Fleſh grows eaſily and quickly but that which comes too faſt, is almoſt always bad; and 'tis better to cut or burn it, than to eat it away with Powders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all great <hi>Wounds</hi> you muſt make a revulſion in the beginning, that is, you muſt divert the courſe of the Humours, and prevent their falling upon the Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Part. The revulſion is to be perform'd by Bleeding, without either Trouble or Charge, which allays the heat of the Humours, leſſens the redundant quantity of 'em, moderates the impetuoſity of their courſe; and if they be corrupt and putrified, it eaſes Nature of a part of ſo troubleſome a Load; and for theſe and other Reaſons, it might be juſtly affirm'd in the general, that <hi>Bleeding</hi> ſeaſonably adminiſter'd is more effectual in this caſe than the beſt <hi>Reſtringent,</hi> and all other Remedies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be fat, you muſt never forget to regulate his Diet, for you can never err in abridging the quantity of his Nouriſhment; and if the Wound be large, let him neither eat <hi>Oats</hi> nor <hi>Hay,</hi> but only a little <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the uſefulneſs of Bleeding two or three times at the beginning, it muſt not be repeated too often, for ſeveral Reaſons too long to be inſerted here, One of the moſt important Rules to be obſerv'd in the Cure of <hi>Wounds,</hi> is that they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179659:309"/>ought never, or as ſeldom as poſſible, to be waſh'd with pure <hi>Water;</hi> the moiſtneſs of which retards the Cure extreamly, by fomenting and encreaſing the natural moiſtneſs of the Fleſh, which muſt be dry'd before the Wound can be heal'd. And therefore when you have occaſion to waſh a Wound, inſtead of Water, make uſe of warm <hi>Wine, Urine,</hi> or the Water of a <hi>Smith's-Forge</hi> lukewarm, to ſcour away the filthineſs and corruption that ſticks in it.</p>
                     <p>After the Wound is cleans'd, 'twill be very convenient to waſh it with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> which allays the Itching, takes away the Heat, promotes the drying of the Fleſh, and prevents its Swelling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You muſt not ſuffer the Horſe to <hi>lick</hi> himſelf, for the Tongue of thoſe Animals poiſons their Wounds, and abſolutely hinders the Cure of 'em; and beſides; he muſt be reſtrain'd from rubbing the Wound againſt any hard thing, that may bruiſe the Fleſh, which in that caſe muſt be ſeparated before the Wound can be heal'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that you muſt never proceed to <hi>Suppuration,</hi> if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour can either be <hi>diſſolv'd</hi> or <hi>repell'd,</hi> eſpecially in Parts that are full of Sinews and Ligaments, or near the Bones, becauſe the Matter that is generated, weakens the Part, and oftentimes leaves a Deformity, or not eaſily reſolvable Tumour; and if it be near a Bone, the Matter corrupts ſome part of it; and conſequently it muſt be <hi>exfoliated,</hi> that is, the corrupt Part muſt be ſeparated. From whence it appears; that we ought always, in the firſt place, to try the efficacy of <hi>Repellents,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Reſtringents,</hi> which have a Power and Faculty to repel and diſſolve the Humours that flow too abundantly to the Wound. <hi>Phyſicians</hi> forbid the uſe of theſe Remedies on certain occaſions, as when a Tumour is <hi>Critical,</hi> proceeding from an effort of Nature, to eaſe an internal and nobler Part, tho' by endangering a leſs conſiderable Member, when 'tis ſeated in the Emunctories or Organs of Secretion, when the Tumour is caus'd by the biting of a Venemous Creature, or when the Matter is thick and tough, or too deeply rooted, and as it were glu'd to the Part: But tho' <hi>repelling</hi> Remedies muſt not be us'd in thoſe Caſes, we muſt endeavour to diſſolve the Swelling and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Matter, by applying Remedies that are endu'd with a Power to attenuate, heat, and diſſolve the Humours before we proceed to <hi>Suppuration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If the <hi>Wound</hi> be accompany'd with a great <hi>Contuſion,</hi> the Cure will be more tedious, for the bruis'd Fleſh muſt putrifie and fall away, and its ſeparation muſt be haſten'd by <hi>Manual Operation,</hi> or by the Application of <hi>Cauſtics;</hi> but the ſureſt and ſafeſt Method is to make uſe of <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> which are eaſily manag'd and guided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The cure of <hi>round</hi> or <hi>circular Wounds</hi> is always attended with ſo much difficulty, that to facilitate the Work, they ought to be cut into a long Figure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> A <hi>Wound</hi> ought to be carefully <hi>cover'd,</hi> for the Air retards the Cure; and for that purpoſe it is very convenient to make uſe of a <hi>Lamb's-Skin,</hi> in thoſe Parts of the Body where it can be conveniently apply'd, and in all others, to cover the Wound with <hi>Tow,</hi> which muſt be cut and beaten, that it may ſtick the faſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Lips of a Wound can never be clos'd or re-united, ſo long as they are <hi>Callous;</hi> and therefore you may rub them with the <hi>Golden Ointment,</hi> mixt with <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi> that was never waſh'd or <hi>precipitated</hi> in Water. This Mixture will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the cloſing of the Bones by deſtroying the <hi>Callus;</hi> but ſince they are ſometimes ſo large and hard, that ſuch Remedies are not able to conſume 'em; they muſt be cut off, or rather Lanc'd and Gaſh'd with a <hi>Fleam</hi> or red-hot Knife, which will haſten the forming of a Cicatrice. As ſoon as you attempt the Cure of a Wound, ſhave the Hair very cloſe about two Fingers breadth round the place, and keep it always neat, clean, and ſupple, that the Skin may be eaſily ſtretch'd, in order to the joining of the Lips of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Simple Wounds made by the <hi>Saddle,</hi> or otherwiſe, if they be not of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable depth, are heal'd by waſhing 'em with <hi>Urine</hi> or warm <hi>Wine,</hi> and afterwards ſtrewing 'em with the Powder of an <hi>old Rope,</hi> or <hi>Flax</hi> cut very ſmall; but if the Wound be ſomewhat large 'twill be convenient to ſubſtitute the <hi>Second Water</hi> inſtead of warm <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Urine,</hi> for it allays the <hi>Itching,</hi> and haſtens the Cure. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179659:309"/>the <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> which is uſually very troubleſome, you may apply <hi>White-Vitriol</hi> in Powder, or rather <hi>Colcothar,</hi> which is more effectual; <hi>Colcothar</hi> is only <hi>Vitriol</hi> burnt, till it grow red.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a <hi>Saddle-Gall</hi> degenerates into a hard Knot call'd a <hi>Sitfaſt;</hi> the uſual Method of Farriers is to anoint it with <hi>Oil of Nuts,</hi> mixt with an equal quantity of Water, or with <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> or <hi>Tallow,</hi> till it fall away of it ſelf, which requires a very long time; and afterwards the Sore may be waſh'd with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> and for want of that with warm <hi>Wine,</hi> and ſtrew'd with <hi>Bran,</hi> and by the conſtant uſe of theſe Applications it will be inſenſibly heal'd.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Sitfaſt</hi> will fall away more eaſily and ſpeedily, if you hold a lighted <hi>Candle</hi> over it, letting the melted <hi>Tallow</hi> drop upon the Knob, and after 'tis ſeparated, waſh the Sore with warm <hi>Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or <hi>Urine,</hi> and anoint it ſlightly with old <hi>Salt-Butter,</hi> ſtrewing upon it the Powder of an old <hi>Rope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Butter</hi> ſupplies the place of a <hi>Detergent,</hi> by keeping the Sore clean, and quickly brings it to a Cicatrice. I have ſeveral times ſeen a <hi>Gangreen,</hi> occaſion'd by a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <hi>Sitfaſt,</hi> and always obſerv'd, that the Horſes dy'd very ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>The ſureſt way to remove a <hi>Sitfaſt,</hi> is to rub it with the <hi>Ointment of Beetles,</hi> or for want of that with ſome good <hi>Retoire,</hi> holding a hot Bar of Iron near the Part, as ſoon as the <hi>Retoire</hi> is laid on, and renewing the Application three Days together. One Application of a <hi>Cauſtic</hi> Ointment will produce the ſame Effect; and thus you may prevent thoſe troubleſome Accidents that are uſually occaſion'd by the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a <hi>Sitfaſt.</hi> If the Wound be ſo large and deep that it muſt be <hi>Tented,</hi> as it uſually happens in the Thighs, Withers, and other parts of the Body, a ſimple <hi>Tent</hi> of ſalted <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> will be ſufficient, unleſs it be neceſſary to keep the Wound open; in which caſe, to avoid large Inciſions, which cannot be perform'd without difficulty, and are never free from danger, inſtead of <hi>Tents</hi> you muſt uſe a <hi>Prepar'd Sponge,</hi> which will open the Wound without Inciſion, and diſcover the bottom of it. This Method is of excellent uſe when the Wound is in thoſe Parts of the Body that are full of Sinews or Tendons, or when the flowing of the Blood hinders you from ſeeing what you ought to cut.</p>

                           <hi>How to prepare a</hi> Sponge <hi>for the opening of</hi> Wounds.</head>
                        <p>Take a fine <hi>Sponge</hi> waſh'd clean, ty'd about very hard with Pack-thread, and wrapt in wet Paper; then lay it in a hollow place in the midſt of the Hearth, covering it with hot Aſhes and live Coals over the Aſhes; leave it there to dry for the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour, or longer; after which take it out, and when 'tis Cold untie it, and cut it with a Knife into what form you pleaſe: Then beſmearing it with a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening or Digeſtive Ointment, to prevent its ſticking to the Fleſh, thruſt it into the bottom of the Wound; the next Day draw it out with your Pincers, and you will find it much ſwoll'n, and the Hole ſufficiently widen'd without hurting the Sinews and Tendons, which could not have been done by Inciſion: But if the Sponge be not ſufficient to open a Wound that is very foul and full of dead Fleſh, provided it be not under the Foot, incorporate two Ounces of <hi>Sublimate</hi> in Powder, with half a Pound of melted <hi>Wax,</hi> and dip a very fine <hi>Sponge</hi> in that Mixture, till it has ſuck'd up as much as it can contain; then lay it in a Preſs two Days and two Nights; after which you may cut it into the form of Tents, and it will both open the Wound, and produce the effect of a Cautery. If you would make it ſtronger, add an Ounce of <hi>Arſenic</hi> in fine Powder, mixing it with melted <hi>Wax,</hi> and the two Ounces of <hi>Sublimate,</hi> which will make an excellent Cautery for <hi>Quitter-bones,</hi> to extirpate the Tendon, or any other corrupt Matter: But if the Sore be under the Foot, occaſion'd by a Nail or Stub, or any other Accident, the <hi>Sponge</hi> prepar'd with <hi>Sublimate</hi> or <hi>Arſenic</hi> muſt not be apply'd leſt the Humours ſhou'd be driven upwards to the <hi>Cronet,</hi> where they might occaſion great Diſorders. In ſuch caſes you may uſe a <hi>Sponge</hi> dipt in <hi>Wax</hi> alone, preſt, and cut into Tents as before, which will open a Wound, but not ſo effectually as the former, ſince it contains not any Cauſtic Ingredients. However, it has this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it neither cauſes Pain, nor hurts the Nerves, and is very convenient for preventing the growth of <hi>Proud-Fleſh</hi> in the Feet; for when the Part is bound up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with Splents, the Sponge being ſwell'd by its Heat and Moiſture, preſſes and keeps down the Fleſh.</p>

                        <p>If the Hole be of a ſufficient wideneſs, you may uſe Tents of <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> which cleanſe the Part and heal the Wound, without bruiſing the Fleſh; but the uſual Tents, if they be not very carefully and exactly made up, retard the Cure, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting it. 'Tis a very important, tho' little obſerv'd, Rule, That the Operation of external Remedies ſhould be aſſiſted by a regular Adminiſtration of inward Medicines. Some commend <hi>Purgation</hi> for the Cure of great Wounds, which, in my Opinion, is a very prepoſterous Method, for it produces a quite contrary effect to the deſign of the Preſcriber, by occaſioning a Defluxion of Humours upon the Part, that are only looſen'd, and put in Motion, but not evacuated by the Medicine.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CIV. Cinnabar Pills <hi>for</hi> Wounds, Worms, Mange, <hi>and</hi> Farcin, <hi>and for the ſhedding of the</hi> Hair <hi>from the</hi> Head <hi>and</hi> Neck.</head>
                     <p>TAke of the fineſt and cleaneſt <hi>Aſſa-foetida, Bay-berries</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> all in fine Powder, of each a Pound, incorporate 'em in a Braſs-Mortar, with a ſufficient quantity of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and make up the Maſs into Pills weighing fourteen Drams each, which muſt be laid in a convenient place to dry. Give two of theſe Pills to the Wounded Horſe, once in two Days, or once every Day, till he has taken eight or ten, according to the greatneſs of the Wound; and that he may ſwallow 'em the more eaſily, you may give 'em in a Pint, or three half Pints of Wine; making him ſtand Bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after the taking of every Doſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Pills may be kept twenty Years: They promote the Cure of a <hi>Wound,</hi> by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Blood, and reſiſting Corruption. They contribute alſo to the Cure of <hi>Gauls</hi> and the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and drive <hi>Worms</hi> out of the Body. This Remedy is highly uſeful in an Army, where the Wounds of Horſes muſt be cur'd with all Expedition; and it may be truly ſaid, that the effects of it are wonderful, and almoſt incredible.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Hair</hi> falls away from the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Neck,</hi> by reaſon of the exceſſive heat of the inward Parts. The uſual Remedy in this caſe is <hi>Bleeding,</hi> but ſince that alone is not ſufficient, it will be very convenient both to adminiſter a Doſe of theſe <hi>Pills</hi> for three Days together, and to rub the bare places twice a Day with good <hi>Lime-Water.</hi> If the Diſeaſe continue ſtill, repeat the whole proceſs, and afterwards give your Horſe <hi>Flower of Brimſtone</hi> in moiſten'd Bran, beginning with a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and augmenting the Doſe by degrees, till it ariſe to half a handful every Day; during which time you may ride your Horſe. For the Cure of thoſe eating <hi>Scabs</hi> that are ſo troubleſome and hard to be rooted out of the <hi>Mane</hi> and <hi>Tail,</hi> after you have Bled and Purg'd your Horſe, give him three or four Doſes of two Pills each, and the external Application of <hi>Lime-Water</hi> will quickly perform the remaining part of the Cure; if not, you muſt reiterate the whole courſe. The ſame Pills may be profitably Adminiſter'd to Horſes that are troubl'd with running Sores in their Legs, or the <hi>Pains, Warts,</hi> or <hi>Bunches, Quitter-bones,</hi> and ſuch like ſtubborn Diſtempers; for they facilitate the Cure by intercepting and diverting the Humour that cauſes and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>After the deſcription of thoſe <hi>Pills</hi> which are of ſuch excellent uſe in the Cure of <hi>Wounds,</hi> I could not forbear ſubjoining a brief Account of their other Virtues, and I hope this digreſſion will neither be uſeleſs nor unwelcome to thoſe Readers who are willing to be Inſtructed. And to ſatisfie thoſe Critical Gentlemen who may peruſe this Book with a deſign rather to pick Quarrels with the Author, than to improve their Knowledge, I am willing to own, that the end of this <hi>Chapter</hi> had perhaps been a more proper place for the deſcription of theſe Pills than the beginning of it; but withal I muſt beg leave to acquaint 'em, that I am not ſo much in love with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, as to give my ſelf the trouble of making an alteration of ſo little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:179659:310"/>
                     <p>Since <hi>Tents</hi> are neceſſary in the Cure of all ſorts of Wounds, and thoſe that are made of <hi>Hog's-Lard</hi> are very convenient for moſt of 'em, it will not be improper to give a ſhort hint of their Preparation and Uſe. Cut the <hi>Lard</hi> into long Pieces, and put one of 'em into the Wound; when you draw it out again you will find it half melted, and muſt ſuffer it to cool, that it may recover its uſual firmneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, after which put it in again, if it be not grown too ſhort.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound be foul, or the Fleſh corrupt, it muſt be waſh'd with the <hi>Yellow-Water</hi> at every Dreſſing; but if you perceive that neither that, nor any other of the uſual <hi>Detergents</hi> are ſufficient to cleanſe the Wound, or if it be peſter'd with <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> add an Ounce of <hi>Arſenic</hi> in fine Powder, to the whole Doſe of the <hi>Lime-Water</hi> that ſhall be deſcrib'd in the following <hi>Chapter.</hi> And if even that be too weak, you muſt burn the whole Wound with a red-hot Plate of Iron; for if you take care not to touch the <hi>Skin, Tendons,</hi> and <hi>Sinews,</hi> there will not the leaſt mark of Burning appear after the Cure. As ſoon as you have <hi>given the Fire,</hi> anoint the burnt Part with <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> covering the whole Wound (if poſſible) with Flax, and continue the uſe of the <hi>Oil,</hi> which muſt be apply'd warm, till the Scab or Eſcar be looſen'd, and ready to fall off; after which 'twill be more convenient to anoint the Part with <hi>Baſilicum</hi> or <hi>Tallow,</hi> till the Scab be quite ſeparated, and you will find the Skin fair underneath, without the leaſt mark of Burning; for this Method of <hi>giving the Fire</hi> excels the beſt Applications of <hi>Powders</hi> and <hi>Ointments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common <hi>Detergent</hi> and cleanſing Remedies are, in my Opinion, too weak for Horſes. They are uſually compos'd of <hi>Honey, Vinegar, Bean-flower, Barley-flower,</hi> the Juices of <hi>Plantane</hi> and <hi>Agrimony, Flower-de-luce</hi> Roots, <hi>Turpentine, Roſin,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Medicines are only <hi>Medicamenta levioris Armaturae,</hi> with reſpect to the Wounds of which I'm treating: But <hi>Unguentum Apoſtolorum, Aegyptiacum,</hi> and the <hi>Neat-herds Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are very proper in this caſe. We muſt not play with Horſes Wounds, nor vainly expect to Cure 'em with ſuch feeble Remedies as the <hi>Golden Ointment,</hi> the <hi>Plaiſter de gratia Dei,</hi> and <hi>Betony-Plaiſter;</hi> for 'tis certain, that <hi>Salt-Butter</hi> is more effectual for keeping Wounds clean, than all thoſe Compoſitions. And therefore the ſureſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is to waſh the Wound with <hi>Urine,</hi> or the <hi>Yellow-Water,</hi> and afterwards to anoint it with <hi>Salt-Butter,</hi> ſtrewing the Powder of <hi>Old-Ropes</hi> upon it: And to apply <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum,</hi> if there be a great deal of corrupt Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The Pain occaſion'd by the Application of <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> ought not to be made an Argument againſt the uſe of it, ſince 'twas never obſerv'd, that any Horſe pin'd away on that occaſion: And to give the Reader a clearer view of the nature of that uſual <hi>Detergent</hi> of Horſes, I thought fit to ſubjoin the Deſcription of it.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Unguentum Aegyptiacum.</head>
                        <p>Take a Pound of common <hi>Honey,</hi> and a Pint of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> boil 'em over a gentle Fire in a glaz'd Pot or Baſon, ſtirring 'em frequently with a Wooden Slice, till they be perfectly united, and the <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> diſappear. Then add two Ounces of <hi>Burnt-Allom,</hi> beaten ſmall, and four Ounces of Powder of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> ſearc'd, ſtirring and incorporating 'em with the other Ingredients. At laſt put in an Ounce of <hi>Sublimate</hi> in fine Powder, ſtirring and boiling as before, till the whole be reduc'd to a due Conſiſtency: After which remove the Pot from the Fire, and continue ſtirring till the Ointment be cold, which muſt be kept in a cover'd Pot for uſe.</p>
                        <p>I have already communicated a deſcription of <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> which I uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> when I have none of the latter ready Prepar'd; for it cleanſes and conſolidates; and ſome Farriers, to whom I gave it, having try'd it on certain occaſions, have wholly laid aſide the uſe of <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> and the <hi>Ointment Apoſtolorum</hi> are alſo very good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce almoſt the ſame Effects; only the <hi>Doctor's Ointment</hi> is ſtronger than <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When you have occaſion for a more powerful Cleanſer, eſpecially when there are any ſigns of a <hi>Gangrene</hi> or Putrefaction, mix two Ounces of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> with the <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi> If you deſire a <hi>Cauſtic</hi> to eat away corrupt Fleſh, exerting its Force only upon that, without hurting the Nerves or Muſcles, you may ſafely apply that which I deſcrib'd under the Name of the <hi>Liquid Cauſtic,</hi> putting it into the Sore with a little <hi>Cotton,</hi> and keeping it in till the Part grow white and mortifi'd. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Liquid Cauſtic</hi> never produces any conſiderable Effect when 'tis ſimply apply'd to the Fleſh, but it operates with at leaſt a double efficacy, when 'tis preſt on
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:179659:311"/>with a Bandage: You may renew the Application till you perceive, that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine has ſufficiently penetrated the Part, and after the falling off of the Scab, if it be not large enough, you may touch the Part again with the <hi>Cauſtic,</hi> to extirpate all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fleſh, and make the Sore fair and clean. As often as you dreſs a Wound or Sore, the ſureſt way is to waſh it with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or rather with the <hi>Lime</hi> or <hi>Yellow Water,</hi> or with <hi>Black-Soap</hi> mixt with <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> which cleanſes very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. If you put in a Tent anointed with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> to cleanſe the bottom of a Sore, it will be of a green Colour when you take it out, which is not an effect of the Matter contain'd in the Sore, but of the <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> that enters the Compoſition of the Medicine.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes after old and neglected Sores, eſpecially in the Feet, the Bones remain bare, without any Fleſh to cover 'em; in this caſe you muſt have recourſe to <hi>Sarcotic</hi> Medicines, that is, ſuch as are endu'd with a Power to make the Fleſh grow, as <hi>Aloes, Sarcocolla,</hi> and <hi>Birthwort,</hi> which may be either apply'd in form of <hi>Powders,</hi> or mixt with <hi>Turpentine, Honey of Roſes,</hi> or ſome other proper <hi>Ointment.</hi> Nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes more effectually to make Fleſh grow upon a Bone than <hi>Monſieur Curtis's Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> if it be melted and mixt with a like quantity of <hi>Oil-Olive.</hi> The following <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is alſo of excellent uſe in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>Take true <hi>Dragon's-Blood</hi> and fine <hi>Bole-Armenic,</hi> of each half an Ounce; <hi>Maſtic, Olibanum,</hi> and <hi>Sarcocolla,</hi> of each three Drams; <hi>Aloes, Round-Birthwort,</hi> and Roots of <hi>Flower-de-Luce,</hi> of each a Dram and half, mix and make a Powder. It may be apply'd alone with very good Succeſs, but the beſt way is to mix it with <hi>Syrup of Roſes, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,</hi> or <hi>Juice of Wormwood.</hi> It makes the Fleſh grow beyond all expectation; and that which is mixt with <hi>Turpentine</hi> ſucceeds beſt, and is moſt proper for the Feet.</p>
                        <p>When a Wound appears fair and clean, the Cure may be eaſily compleated with the uſual <hi>Drying Powders;</hi> but great care muſt be taken to keep the Lips clean and moiſt, and to clip away the Hair for two Finger's breadth round the Sore. But ſince the ſpeedineſs of the Cure is of great Importance in an Army, where <hi>Gnats</hi> and other <hi>Inſects</hi> are ſo troubleſome, and the Sores ſo very apt to putreſie: I know not a more effectual Remedy in thoſe caſes than the <hi>Powder of Sympathy,</hi> which produces ſuch wonderful effects, that they who either have not try'd it, or are not capable of ſo nice an enquiry, cannot be perſwaded that they proceed from natural cauſes.</p>

                        <p>Take a convenient quantity of good common <hi>Vitriol,</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> is beſt, the <hi>German</hi> may be alſo us'd, but that of <hi>Cyprus</hi> is not at all fit for this purpoſe) put it in a flat-bottom'd Earthen Pan, and expoſe it in the open Air to the hotteſt Rays of the Sun, removing it always at Night, and in moiſt Weather, till the <hi>Vitriol</hi> be Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd and reduc'd to a white <hi>Calx.</hi> In the mean time you muſt ſtir it every Day with a <hi>Wooden-ſlice,</hi> for it muſt never be touch'd with <hi>Iron,</hi> which is apt to weaken it, and deprive it of its Virtue, eſpecially when the Sun has open'd its Body, and begun the <hi>Calcination,</hi> the time of which is uncertain. As ſoon as you perceive, that it has acquir'd a perfectly white Colour, take it out of the Pan, and preſerve it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in a dry place, for this is the true <hi>Powder of Sympathy.</hi> Take a Cloth ſtain'd with ſome Blood from the Wound, and ſtrew this Powder upon it, then lay it in a temp'rate place, powd'ring it every Day; and if there be Matter in the Wound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome of it upon a Cloth, and ſtrew it with the ſame Powder.</p>
                        <p>If the Wound require Suppuration, lay the Cloth in a moiſt place; if to be dry'd in a dry place; and if you are oblig'd, by reaſon of the depth of the Wound, to make uſe of <hi>Tents,</hi> put 'em in clean and dry, and ſtrew the Powder on 'em when you take 'em out, continuing to obſerve the ſame Method, till the Wound be heal'd. I have ſeen the Solution of this Powder apply'd to <hi>Men</hi> with extraordinary Succeſs for <hi>Wrenches</hi> and <hi>Sinew-ſtrains;</hi> for many Perſons have been cur'd very ſpeedily and more effectually, than if they had us'd all other Remedies, by binding a Linnen-Cloth, five or ſix times doubl'd, and dipt in this Solution, about the Part, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing it twice a Day. 'Tis true, this is not the effect of <hi>Sympathy,</hi> but thoſe who are cur'd by it are very well ſatisfy'd, tho' they are ignorant of the cauſe to which they owe their recovery; and 'tis certainly more effectual in theſe caſes, than either the <hi>Imperial</hi> or <hi>Angelic</hi>-Water, or that of the <hi>Queen of Hungary,</hi> and even than all <hi>Balſams, Oils,</hi> and <hi>Ointments</hi> whatſoever.

                        <p>When a Horſe's back is Gaul'd, during a Journey, the beſt way is to take out a little of the ſtuffing of the <hi>Pannel</hi> over the Swelling, then ſow a piece of white and very ſoft Leather on the inſide of the <hi>Pannel,</hi> anoint it with <hi>Salt-Butter,</hi> and every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wipe it clean, rubbing it till it grow ſoft, and anointing it again with <hi>Butter;</hi> or, for want of that, with <hi>Greaſe.</hi> Waſh the Swelling or Hurt every Evening with cold <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Soap,</hi> and ſtrew it with <hi>Salt,</hi> till the Horſe be Sadl'd in the Morning.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sea-ruſh</hi> that is uſually wrapt about Glaſſes that are brought in Cheſts from <hi>Venice,</hi> is of admirable efficacy for the cure of <hi>Saddle-Gauls,</hi> during a Journey. 'Tis ſoft, and conſequently does not bruiſe the Fleſh; and its ſaltneſs quickly heals the Sore, if a large quantity of it be thruſt into that part of the Pannel that touches the Gaul'd place.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes Coach-Horſes are gaul'd in the Breaſt by their Harneſs; and the Part is either Sore, or riſes in hard Bunches, eſpecially in Rainy Weather. In this caſe you muſt ſhave off the Hair very cloſe about the Sore place, and then rub the whole Breaſt with <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Black-ſoap;</hi> or for want of that with any other kind of <hi>Soap,</hi> chafing it gently into a Lather, for the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour; after which waſh that part of the Breaſt, which is uſually cover'd by the <hi>Petrel,</hi> with <hi>Salt-Water,</hi> ſuffering it to dry up of it ſelf. Then look upon the Harneſs, and if the Gauling be occaſion'd by any hardneſs in the Leather, you muſt either take it away, or ſow on little Bolſters to hinder the Harneſs from rubbing on the Sore place. In Rainy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179659:312"/>Weather, eſpecially in Harveſt, the Crupper of the Horſe is uſually Gaul'd, or at leaſt the places that are cover'd with the Harneſs are ſwoll'n, fretted, and cover'd with a ſort of Scurf. Rub the Part with <hi>Black-ſoap,</hi> and a little <hi>Water,</hi> till the Soap be turn'd to Froth, chaſing it in with your Hand, and letting it dry upon the Part.</p>
                        <p>By the ſame Method you may quickly cure a Sore, occaſion'd by the taking away of a <hi>Sitfaſt.</hi>

                           <hi>How to ſtanch</hi> Bleeding.</head>
                        <p>The cutting of a large Veſſel by a great Gaſh or Wound, is uſually follow'd by ſo violent a Flux of <hi>Blood,</hi> that the ordinary Methods are not ſufficient to ſtop it. In this caſe the <hi>Powder of Sympathy</hi> is an excellent Remedy; but thoſe who cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, or are not willing to uſe it, muſt endeavour, if they can, to lay bare, and bind up the cut Veſſel, which is the fureſt way to ſtop the Blood. If that cannot be done, the Orifice of the Veſſel muſt be ſtopt with a piece of <hi>Roman-Vitriol,</hi> and the Wound bound up, if the Situation of the Part admit of a Bandage; if not, the uſual Remedy is to Sear the Part with a hot Iron, for nothing ſtops <hi>Bleeding</hi> more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than the Application of an <hi>actual Cautery,</hi> or Searing-Iron; but thoſe who are afraid of <hi>Burning,</hi> may try the Succeſs of other Remedies.</p>
                        <p>For Example, Take equal quantities of <hi>Colcothar,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> Calcin'd till it grow red; <hi>Frankinſence,</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> in Powder; mix 'em with <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Honey,</hi> and add a convenient quantity of the Hair of a <hi>Hare</hi> cut ſmall.</p>
                        <p>If this Remedy prove ineffectual, add to it <hi>Dragon's-Blood, Man's-Blood</hi> dry'd, <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> and <hi>Calcin'd Vitriol,</hi> either all together, or only part of 'em, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtanch the Blood, if it be apply'd in a ſufficient quantity.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame effect is produc'd by the <hi>Ligature,</hi> which Surgeons call the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Bandage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the Blood is ſtopt, you muſt ſuffer the Wound to remain untouch'd, for the ſpace of three Days, that you may know whether the Veſſel be exactly clos'd. The Simples that are indu'd with a Virtue to ſtop and prevent <hi>Bleeding,</hi> are the Roots and Leaves of <hi>Nettles;</hi> the Bark of a <hi>Pomgranate</hi> and <hi>Pine</hi>-Tree; the Leaves of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> and <hi>Willows, Services,</hi> or <hi>Sorb-Apples;</hi> burnt <hi>Galls,</hi> quench'd in <hi>Vinegar; Bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, Starch, Soot, Litharge, Ceruſs, Vitriol, Colcothar, Allom,</hi> a <hi>Sponge</hi> dry'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Powder, and dry <hi>Coriander-ſeeds.</hi> But in caſe of neceſſity, there cannot be a more pleaſant and effectual Remedy than <hi>Cauſtics</hi> or <hi>Cauteries,</hi> either in Powder or any other form, which raiſe a Scab or Eſchar that ſtops the Paſſage; and I have ſeen Powder of <hi>Arſenic</hi> apply'd on certain occaſions, which quickly makes a large Eſchar. When the Scab falls off, great care muſt be taken to prevent a new Flux of Blood; and conſequently the Wound muſt neither be irritated by ſharp Remedies, nor by putting in of a <hi>Probe.</hi> You may eaſily compoſe a Powder of the above-mention'd Simples to ſtop <hi>Bleeding;</hi> for example, take the dry Bark of a <hi>Pomgranate, Roman-Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Allom,</hi> of each an equal quantity; mix and apply it to the Wound.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CVI. <hi>Of a Horſe that is</hi> Wrung <hi>or</hi> Hurt <hi>in the</hi> Withers.</head>
                     <p>HAving treated of the Cure of <hi>Simple Wounds,</hi> I ſhall in the next place proceed to conſider thoſe that are occaſion'd or preceded by Tumours.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe be hurt, by the biting of another Horſe, on the Neck or near the <hi>Withers,</hi> keep the Part clean, and waſh it with <hi>Lime-Water</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> or chafe it with <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Soap,</hi> or waſh it with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> obſerving the Directions preſcrib'd for the Cure of Wounds. If there be only a ſimple Contuſion, uſe <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> and if the Wound be ſmall, anoint it with <hi>Oil of Walnuts,</hi> mixt with <hi>Red-Wine,</hi> and apply'd cold. If the Horſe have large and fleſhy <hi>Withers</hi> the Cure will be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than in thoſe who have nothing but Skin and Bone, by reaſon of the Moiſture contain'd in the Fleſh, and increas'd by the Phlegmatic Humour furniſh'd by Nature to facilitate the motion of the Joints; for the redundant Humidity occaſions the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179659:313"/>growth of Proud-Fleſh, hinders the drying of the Part, and makes the Cure diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and tedious.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a hurt in the <hi>Withers</hi> is occaſion'd by the largeneſs of the Saddle-Bows which bruiſe and cruſh the Fleſh; and in that caſe 'tis the uſual Cuſtom of Farriers to apply a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> of Powder of <hi>Bole-Armenic, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs.</hi> I approve of that which follows, and dare affirm, that it will cure the Hurt, if it be not very great.</p>
                     <p>Beat the <hi>Whites</hi> of ſix <hi>Eggs</hi> with a piece of <hi>Allom</hi> almoſt as big as an Egg, for the ſpace of half a quarter of an Hour without intermiſſion, till the whole be reduc'd to a very thick Scum or Froth, with which you muſt rub the Swelling, and afterwards cover it with the reſt of the Froth, ſuffering it to dry upon the Part. Ten or twelve Hours after repeat the Application, neither muſt you be ſurpris'd, if the Heat and Swelling ſtill remain; for a repelling and an aſtringent Remedy, ought not only to drive the Humours from one part to another, but to expel it thro' the Pores, by preſſing and binding the Part that was dilated by the Humour deriv'd from the Veins.</p>
                     <p>If the Hurt be great, you muſt begin the Cure with letting the Horſe Blood in the Neck, and the Bleeding muſt be repeated two Days after, to prevent the impetuous deſcent of the Humours upon the Part affected; but if there be only a ſmall Hurt, you may ſafely omit the letting of Blood. If the Contuſion occaſion'd by the <hi>Saddle-bows,</hi> be follow'd by a Tumour and Inflammation, anoint the Sore place with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and cover the <hi>Withers</hi> with a Lamb-Skin; after you have bath'd them with <hi>Lime-Water,</hi> prepar'd without <hi>Sublimate;</hi> for that Remedy does very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully allay the Inflammation; and if there be no Matter generated, may alone ſuffice to aſſwage the Swelling; if not, apply the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and cover the Sore place with a Lamb's-Skin, laying the Woolly ſide next the Part, and continue to anoint it thrice every Day; which Method is infinitely more natural than the Application of <hi>Defenſives,</hi> which produce no effect if there be a great Swelling and Heat preceded by a violent Contuſion; but if the Swelling continue accompany'd with Heat, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſion, and Beating, ſo that you have reaſon to believe, that there is already Matter generated, or that the Tumour tends to Suppuration, you muſt alter your Method, and waſh off the Ointment with luke-warm <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> mixt with a handful of <hi>Salt;</hi> and as ſoon as the Part is dry, chafe it with an Ointment made of half a Pound of <hi>Populeon,</hi> a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> and the like quantity of <hi>Black-Soap</hi> mixt cold, and diluted with a large Glaſs of <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Ointment being apply'd gently to prevent a further Contuſion of the Part will diſſipate the Humours and take away the Heat; after which the Sore place muſt be cover'd with a Lamb's-Skin to promote the Operation of the Ointment. <hi>Note,</hi> That the Application muſt be renew'd at leaſt four times a Day, to divert the Humour, and prevent any danger of Corruption.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time give your Horſe a Doſe of <hi>Cinnabar-Pills</hi> for two Days together, keeping him Bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after every Doſe; two Days after adminiſter the Pills again, repeating the ſame Doſe from time to time; for they are endu'd with a wonderful efficacy to aſſiſt Nature in the Expulſion and Concoction of the Matter contain'd in the <hi>Withers;</hi> from whence 'tis plain, that they are very proper to promote the Cure, if you perſiſt in the uſe of 'em, till you perceive the Matter to be already generated.</p>

                           <hi>To</hi> draw <hi>and</hi> ripen <hi>a</hi> Swelling.</head>
                        <p>When Nature requires your aſſiſtance to digeſt the Humour and haſten Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you cannot procure the above-mention'd <hi>Ointments,</hi> prepare that which follows.</p>
                        <p>Take the Powders of <hi>Cummin-ſeed</hi> and <hi>Linſeed,</hi> of each an equal quantity, boil 'em in <hi>Cow's-Milk,</hi> with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Pigeon's-Dung</hi> in Powder, rather too much than too little, and make a Pulteſs, which will ripen the Swelling, and aſſwage the Pain. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take four Ounces of the Roots of <hi>Marſh-Mallows</hi> beaten, boil 'em in Water, and afterwards add Leaves of <hi>Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Brankurſin,</hi> of each a handful. After they are well boil'd, beat 'em to a Maſh, adding <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> of each two Ounces, Flower of <hi>Fenugreek-Seed,</hi> as much as may ſuffice to thicken the whole, and apply it warm to the Part. When you have brought the Tumour to Suppuration,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:179659:313"/>that is, when the Matter is generated, and ready to be let out, make one or more Holes in the lower part of the Swelling, with a red-hot Iron, about the bigneſs of the end of your Finger, and having preſt out the Matter, dreſs the Holes with ſoft Tents, beſmear'd with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> which will both make the Tents ſtick, and prevent an Inflammation. Or you may put in Tents of <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> reaching from one Hole to the other, and carry on the Suppuration ſo long as it ſhall be neceſſary; but above all, you muſt take care to make the Holes in the lower part of the Swelling, and leave no boggy or hollow place underneath, that the whole Matter may be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated; and if you perceive that there is ſome Matter left, or that the Skin is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Fleſh below the Holes, you muſt immediately pierce the Skin with a red-hot Iron at the end of the hollow Place; for without that Precaution the Skin would never be united to the Fleſh. Then put in Tents moiſten'd with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> from one Hole to another, to draw out all the Matter. <hi>Note,</hi> That the Tents muſt be rowl'd hard, leſt they hurt or bruiſe the Part.</p>
                        <p>Having put in the Tents, you muſt take care to keep the Swelling moiſt with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> to allay the Inflammation, continuing to dreſs the Holes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Tents till the Cure be compleated. And beſides, if there be a large hollow within, you muſt inject with a Syringe ſome of the <hi>Waters</hi> for <hi>Gun-ſhot Wounds,</hi> or the <hi>Yellow-Water,</hi> if there be a great deal of Putrefaction.</p>
                        <p>Swellings upon the <hi>Withers</hi> are ſooner cur'd by this Method than by Inciſion; for the Fleſh that is cut or touch'd with the Razor, rots and falls away; the Part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains deform'd, and not unfrequently the Sore is very much enlarg'd without neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>You may ſafely uſe this Method when the bottom of the Sore is ſound, and when the Bones are not infected with any <hi>Caries</hi> or Corruption. But if you perceive that there is a Scale to be ſeparated, or a <hi>Felander,</hi> or ſuch like putrefy'd Matter ſticking to the Bone, the ſureſt way is to cut off all that is Corrupted; and even the Mane, if there be occaſion, without touching the Nerve that runs along it, diſcovering at once the bottom of the Sore, and piercing to the Quick. You muſt not leave any high or ſwelling Lips, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> cut the Sore ſloping; and above all, you muſt take care to give the Matter a Vent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> keep it from ſtagnating. The Operation muſt be heedfully perform'd, for the cutting of the <hi>Neck-Sinew</hi> wou'd certainly ſpoil the Horſe; and therefore you muſt carefully ſeparate the corrupt Fleſh from the Sinew. Having thus freed the Sore from all Impurities, and cut off all the corrupt and putrefy'd Fleſh, ſtrew the place with red-hot Aſhes taken out of a burning Fire, continuing to caſt on the Aſhes till the Blood be ſtopt. Let the Sore remain untouch'd till the next Day, and then waſh it with the Water of a <hi>Smith's-Forge,</hi> luke-warm, or with warm <hi>Wine, Urine,</hi> or the <hi>Second Water,</hi> and powder it again with hot Aſhes. Repeat the ſame two or three times once in twenty four Hours; after which you will find the Sore in a very hopeful condition, without Swelling, Heat, or any other ſymptom that may retard the Cure; for the Salt contain'd in the Aſhes is heated and melted by the moiſtneſs of the Sore, and being a kind of <hi>Alkali,</hi> it deſtroys the <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Humour</hi> that falls by way of Defluxion upon the Part, and that being deſtroy'd, the Swelling abates and the Heat vaniſhes. This is an excellent Method; but ſince 'tis not always eaſie, nor ſometimes poſſible to procure Aſhes, eſpecially in an Army, you may obſerve the following Directions. After you have made the Inciſion, take a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Green Copperas</hi> (that of <hi>Germany</hi> is cheapeſt) diſſolve it in Water, till the Water be fully ſaturated, and incapable of diſſolving any more; and with this Solution bathe the Wound or Sore, applying afterwards Flax dipt in the ſame Water, and binding it on carefully. Forty eight Hours after take off the Dreſſing, and if you perceive any Inflammation or Swelling, renew the Application of the Flax dipt in the Solution of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which will certainly aſſwage the Heat and Swelling. Then waſh the Sore with the <hi>Water</hi> of a <hi>Smith's-Forge</hi> lukewarm, and after that with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or with <hi>Lime-Water,</hi> and beſmear it with <hi>Ox-Gall,</hi> covering it very ſoftly with Flax, or Powder of <hi>old Ropes,</hi> which being remov'd the next Day, will leave the Sore fair and clean. Waſh it again with the <hi>Second Water,</hi> or with <hi>Lime-water,</hi> to allay the <hi>Itching</hi> that uſually obſtructs the Cure, and afterwards anoint it with <hi>Ox-Gall,</hi> and cover it ſoftly with <hi>Flax</hi> or Powder of <hi>old Ropes,</hi> as before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing after the ſame manner till it be heal'd. If you perceive any corrupt or bruis'd Fleſh, apply <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or one of the above-mention'd <hi>Cauſtics,</hi> or (which is the ſureſt way) burn the Part, and after the Scab falls off, anoint it again with <hi>Ox-Gall,</hi> and continue as before till it be perfectly heal'd. To conſume <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi>
                           <pb n="168" facs="tcp:179659:314"/>ſince 'tis not always convenient to apply <hi>Cauſtics,</hi> you may ſtrew it with the Powder of <hi>white Vitriol,</hi> which will quickly eat it away.</p>
                        <p>If the Application of the <hi>Ox-Gall</hi> do not anſwer your expectation, you may have recourſe to one of the Ointments preſcrib'd for the Cure of Wounds, eſpecially the <hi>Hermit's Ointment,</hi> applying ſometimes <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> or Powder of <hi>Colcothar</hi> to conſume the corrupt Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>I have already intimated, and I cannot too often repeat it, that as ſoon as you perceive corrupt Fleſh in a Wound or Sore, or fleſhy Excreſcencies that riſe like Buttons above it; you muſt burn 'em with a hot Iron, or apply the Powder of <hi>Colcothar;</hi> that is, common <hi>Vitriol</hi> calcin'd till it grow red; and after the falling away of a very little Scab, the Wound will remain fair and clean.</p>
                        <p>During the cure of Hurts in the <hi>Withers,</hi> or other Parts of the Body, you may waſh the Part with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> which heals, cleanſes, and allays the <hi>Itching;</hi> and the ſame Effects are alſo produc'd by the <hi>Second Water.</hi> If theſe Ointments be not ſtrong enough, powder the Sore with <hi>white Vitriol,</hi> and lay a convenient Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over it, continuing to dreſs it after that manner till the Fleſh be ſufficiently firm.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Water,</hi> far from cauſing any Inflammation, allays and tempers the heat of a Wound; and beſides, it does not occaſion any conſiderable Pain, for the <hi>Opium</hi> benumbs the Senſe of Feeling, and blunts the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol.</hi> It ſtrengthens and promotes the growth of a new Sole, and there cannot be a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for <hi>Quitter-bones,</hi> Pricks with a <hi>Nail</hi> or <hi>Stub, Falſe-Quarters, Proud-Fleſh, Scab'd-Heels,</hi> and in one word, for all ſorts of Wounds and Sores, if the Bones do not appear uncover'd. It allays the <hi>Itching</hi> of Hurts in the <hi>Withers</hi> and other Parts of the Body, and ſo prevents the Inconveniencies that are occaſion'd by tying up the Horſe ſo ſhort, that he cannot lie down, to hinder him from ſcrubbing the Sore. If you waſh the Part with this <hi>Water</hi> every Day, and apply a convenient Ointment, the Wound or Sore will be quickly heal'd without that troubleſome Itching which retards the Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of great Wounds is alſo obſtructed by <hi>Felanders,</hi> which breed in 'em; and therefore you muſt burn 'em to the very Bone, and apply a <hi>Digeſtive</hi> to haſten the falling of the Eſchar.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> do not cleanſe the Wound ſufficiently from all Corruption, dip a little Cotton in the <hi>Liquid Cauſtic,</hi> deſcrib'd in the Eighth <hi>Chapter,</hi> or in pure <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> and apply it to the part of the Wound that is to be ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the ends of the <hi>Tendons</hi> and <hi>Sinews</hi> are hurt, and weaken'd by the Contuſion that accompanies the Wound, or are corrupted by the long continuance of the Matter, or even by the violence of the Remedies; and in theſe caſes there remains ſo much weakneſs in the Nervous Parts, that the Horſe continues ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards leſs fit for Service than formerly. As ſoon, therefore, as you perceive the Wound to be fair and clean, and wholly free from foul and corrupt Fleſh, take two Ounces of <hi>Aloes,</hi> and one Ounce of <hi>Myrrh</hi> in Powder, and put them into a large
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:179659:314"/>Matraſs, with half a Pint of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> ſtopping the Veſſel very cloſe, and ſetting it on hot Aſhes till the <hi>Spirit</hi> be ſufficiently Impregnated with the Tincture of the Subſtances; this <hi>Tincture</hi> being apply'd cold on Bolſters of Flax to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Nerves, aſſwages Pain, promotes the healing of Wounds, deſtroys Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and prevents a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and therefore it ought to be apply'd to all ſorts of Wounds, when there is any ſign or fear of a <hi>Mortification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Powder of <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> deſcrib'd in the beginning of the following <hi>Chapter,</hi> is excellent for incarnating and drying up Wounds; and when they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt clos'd, if there remains no Swelling or Deformity, you may rub the Lips of the Wound with <hi>Unguentum Aureum,</hi> mixt with the <hi>Emetic</hi> or <hi>Angelical Powder</hi> once waſh'd, which is of great efficacy to joyn and renew the Skin, when the Cure is already brought to ſuch a degree of Perfection, that the Application of Remedies ſeems to be altogether uſeleſs. I have often with very good Succeſs, anointed the Scar with <hi>Oil of St. John's-wort,</hi> which makes a fine ſmooth Cicatrice, without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any Lips, unevenneſs, or any other Deformity, which are the uſual effects of the ignorance of the Farrier. If you have no <hi>Angelical Powder,</hi> you may uſe inſtead of it the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony;</hi> or (if that be alſo wanting) with a little <hi>Colcothar,</hi> mixt with <hi>Unguentum Aureum,</hi> anoint the <hi>Callous</hi> Lips of the Wound; for theſe Applications will take away the <hi>Callus,</hi> and make a fine Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, That a Horſe will put himſelf into all manner of Poſtures to rub the Wound, when it begins to heal, and ſometimes thruſt his Head under his Flank to bite and ſcrub it. Theſe Inconveniencies muſt be prevented with all poſſible Care, leſt after you have left the Wound fair and clean, you find it at your return bloody, foul, and bruis'd, and be oblig'd to begin the Cure again; for all the Fleſh that is rubb'd will certainly fall away.</p>
                     <p>I cur'd a Horſe of a hurt in the <hi>Withers,</hi> who was obſtinately inclin'd to rub the Part, and ſo induſtrious in finding out means to do it, that we were oblig'd to tye him up in ſuch a manner that he could not ſtir any part of his Body; his Head and Tail were ty'd; and beſides, he was hung up for the eaſe of his Legs, but ſo low that his Feet touch'd the Ground. Yet for all our Precautions, he found a way to hinder the cloſing of the Wound by the motion of the Skin of his Neck, ſo that if I had not ty'd his Head very low, I cou'd never have perfected the Cure.</p>
                     <p>When the Wounds are fair and clean, you muſt, in the next place, proceed to dry 'em with Powders, and you will find thoſe that are leaſt Compound, to be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, eſpecially this; Take a convenient quantity of old pitch'd <hi>Boat-Ropes,</hi> dry 'em in a Furnace till they may be eaſily beaten to Powder in a Mortar, ſtrain it thro' a Hair-Sieve, and having bath'd the Wound with the <hi>Second,</hi> or the <hi>Yellow-Water,</hi> ſtrew this Powder upon it, leaving the Wound untouch'd, till the Scurfs caus'd by the Powder fall away; after which renew the Application as before, and continue after the ſame manner till the Wound be heal'd. The ſureſt way is to tye up the Horſe in ſuch a manner that he may neither be able to touch the Wound with his Tongue, nor to rub or ſcratch it; and even you may hang him up, and in ſome caſes keep him ſix Months in that Poſture, as I have oftentimes done, waſhing their Legs every Day with cold Water.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of great Hurts in the <hi>Withers,</hi> the Matter that ſtagnates in the Part does frequently corrupt the Fleſh that ſurrounds it, and the Corruption ſlips in between the flat and broad Bone of the Shoulder and the Body, as you may perceive by ſearching the Wound with your Probe. In this caſe you muſt lay the whole Part bare, and cut a Paſſage for the Matter and Corruption, that none of it may be left at the bottom of the Sore, and afterwards cure the Wound according to the ordinary Method. And ſince the Shoulder-Blade can never be re-united to the Body, ſo long as the Motion of the Shoulder keeps it ſeparated, you muſt Shackle the two Fore-Legs, that the Horſe may be kept conſtantly in one Poſture, dreſſing the Wound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the above-mention'd Directions. If you perceive a large Cavity, make uſe of the <hi>Waters,</hi> or <hi>Potions</hi> for <hi>Gun-ſhot</hi> Wounds, deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CX. Syringing the Wound twice every Day, and exhibiting the <hi>Cinnabar Pills</hi> inwardly, to haſten the Cure.</p>

                     <p>TAke <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> reduc'd to Powder, and ſearc'd, of each a Pound; mix 'em and put 'em into a Pot over a moderate Fire, ſtirring perpetually till they be throughly dry'd, and as it were Calcin'd, ſo that the Matter may be beaten and reduc'd to a fine Powder, which will incarnate and dry up a clean and red Wound. The only inconveniency of this Powder is, that it draws Flies to the Part in the Summer; nor will you find a more effectual Remedy among all that vaſt variety of Powders, with which Books of this Nature are ſtuff'd, if it be apply'd in a Seaſon when there are no Flies. <hi>Charcoal</hi> beaten, old <hi>Shooes</hi> burn'd, ſifted <hi>Aſhes,</hi> Powder of <hi>Roſemary,</hi> or <hi>Sage,</hi> &amp;c. are alſo very proper.</p>

                           <hi>Other</hi> Powders <hi>to dry up Wounds.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Thoſe who live in a place where <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> is made, may eaſily prepare a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to dry up Wounds, and prevent the growth of <hi>Proud-Fleſh;</hi> for the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> that remains in the <hi>Retort</hi> after the diſtillation of <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> beaten to Powder and apply'd to the Wounds, is more effectual than <hi>Burnt Allum, Calcin'd Vitriol,</hi> and other ſuch like Powders. The Diſtillers of <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> ſell the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> at a very low rate, for if they do not meet with a Cuſtomer, they throw it away as uſeleſs; ſo that you may have a Porter's Burthen of it for Ten Pence. The diſtillation extracts only the moſt Spirituous and Volatil Parts of the Ingredients; but the Fixt Salts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and perform the effect requir'd in this caſe. <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> is diſtill'd from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Bock-Allum,</hi> and <hi>Salt-Peter;</hi> and that which remains in the <hi>Retort,</hi> after the firſt Method of Diſtillation, is indu'd with the Virtues of <hi>Calcin'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> as that which remains after the ſecond, produces the effect of <hi>Burnt-Allum.</hi> I am not ignorant that there are ſeveral other ways of diſtilling <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> but theſe are moſt uſual; and beſides, the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> is always proper in theſe caſes, whatever be the Ingredients or Method of the Diſtillation; for example, <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, Sal Gemmae,</hi> and <hi>Bole-Armenic</hi> are join'd to <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> in the diſtillation of thoſe Waters that are known by the Name of <hi>Aqua-Regia,</hi> and leave in the <hi>Retort</hi> a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which is very effectual for the drying of Wounds, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the growth of <hi>Proud-Fleſh,</hi> if they be reduc'd to Powder, and apply'd to the Part. This Advice is particularly directed to Farriers, who uſe a great quantity of theſe ſorts of Powders.</p>
                        <p>Before all other drying Powders, I prefer thoſe that are made of the <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> remaining in the <hi>Retort</hi> after the diſtillation of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> becauſe there is always ſome <hi>Bole-Armenic,</hi> mixt with the <hi>Vitriol</hi> to prevent its melting in the <hi>Retort,</hi> ſince it would not yield any <hi>Spirit,</hi> if it were in a ſtate of Fuſion. And the <hi>Bole</hi> mixt with the <hi>Calcin'd Vitriol,</hi> which is endu'd with a certain Balſamic Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, makes a Compoſition that hinders the falling down of any Defluxion upon the Part, and dries the Wound very effectually and ſpeedily.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Borax</hi> in fine Powder is an excellent Remedy to dry up Wounds and hinder the growth of <hi>Proud-Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arſmart</hi> or <hi>Water-Pepper,</hi> dry'd and beaten to Powder dries up Wounds; and even if it be ſtamp'd while 'tis green, and put between the Wound and the Saddle, it cures a ſmall Hurt.</p>

                           <hi>Another</hi> Powder <hi>to dry up</hi> Wounds.</head>
                        <p>The drying up of Wounds is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe the beſt <hi>Ointments</hi> keep the Parts moiſt, and are apt to breed Matter. Suppoſing, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that you have dreſs'd a <hi>Quitter-bone,</hi> ſo long till there remains no bottom in the Sore, that is, till you can diſcover no cavity with your Probe, the Matter at the ſame time ceaſing to run, you may conclude that 'tis time to apply Powders, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you ride your Horſe.</p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:179659:315"/>
                        <p>The following Powder is excellent in ſuch Caſes, for it ſticks ſo faſt that a Horſe cannot poſſibly ſhift it off by any Motion; beſides, it raiſes a Scurf on the Sore, that prevents the Corruption of the Fleſh, and after the Scurf is fall'n, you will find the Sore all over Cicatriz'd. Renew the Application of the Powder, continuing after the ſame manner; and the Sore will be ſooner Cured by this Method than any other whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>The Powder is thus prepar'd; Take a ſufficient quantity of good <hi>White Tartar,</hi> which is only the dry Lees of Wine that ſtick to the Bottom of the Cask; burn it in an Earthen Pot, ſurrounded with live Charcoal, till the Pot grow red; then ſuffer it to cool, and reduce it to a Powder, which in the Language of Art is call'd Powder of <hi>Calcin'd Tartar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It drys all ſorts of Wounds or Hurts in the <hi>Withers,</hi> or any other part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; 'tis good for a Weeping or Frothy Sole, that cannot be dry'd with the uſual Remedies. When 'tis apply'd to a Wound, it raiſes a Scurf, which muſt be ſo forc'd to fall away before the Application be renew'd.</p>
                        <p>Burn ſome <hi>Oiſter-Shells</hi> in the Fire till they grow perfectly white; then take 'em out, and after they are cold, beat 'em to a very fine Powder, which is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſucceſsful Remedy for Wounds and Scars, becauſe it is a true <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> ſeparated entirely from all its <hi>Acid</hi> Particles by the Action of the Fire: And therefore as ſoon as 'tis apply'd to the Wounds, it imbibes and ſucks up as much of the <hi>Acid</hi> Juice, or Humour, as 'tis capable of containing, and ſo frees the Wound or Sore from the force of all the Diſorders with which 'tis attended, ſuch as Pain, Inflammation, Eating or Corroding of the Fleſh, Swelling and every thing elſe that obſtructs the healing or cloſing of the Wound. Thus Nature being deliver'd from her Enemy by the frequent Applications of the burnt or calcin'd <hi>Shells,</hi> exerts all her Vigour for the ſpeedy Cure of the Wound. I know few Farriers that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of comprehending the force of this way of Reaſoning, ſince the moſt ingenious Perſons of that Profeſſion content themſelves with judging of Cauſes by their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, without penetrating further into the Nature of Diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who are troubl'd with external <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> or <hi>Piles,</hi> may uſe this Powder with ſucceſs, applying it to the Tumours when they bleed, mixt with <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> or ſome other convenient <hi>Liniment;</hi> for it deſtroys the <hi>Acid</hi> that occaſions the Pain and Heat.</p>
                        <p>The Powder of calcin'd <hi>Muſcel-Shells</hi> produces the ſame Effect, if it be apply'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Wound in Horſes, or <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> in Men, becauſe it is a powerfull <hi>Alkali</hi> that abſorbs all <hi>Acid</hi> Juices.</p>
                        <p>The Bones of a <hi>Cuttle-Fiſh</hi> that are every where to be found in Druggiſts Shops, and commonly us'd by Goldſmiths for caſting of Rings in a Mould, are endu'd with almoſt the ſame Virtues, for they contain an excellent <hi>Alkali</hi> that dries up all ſorts of Wounds. They are very brittle, and may be eaſily reduc'd to a very fine Powder.</p>
                        <p>All ſorts of <hi>Bones</hi> that are of a porous or leſs compact contexture, if they be burnt till they are very white, and eaſily reducible to Powder, are of excellent uſe for the drying up of Wounds or Sores; for they are fixt <hi>Alkali's</hi> ſeparated from their reſpective <hi>Acids</hi> by calcination, and immediately ſuck up the <hi>Acid</hi> contain'd in the Wound, which is the only Sourſe of all the Diſorders that hinder the Cure.</p>

                     <p>THE Hurts that affect this Part are almoſt as dangerous as the <hi>Wringing</hi> of the <hi>Withers,</hi> and therefore as ſoon as you perceive a Swelling, you muſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay <hi>hot Dung</hi> in a Bag to the Tumour, and if it be not aſſwag'd in ſix Hours, apply <hi>Whites of Eggs</hi> beaten and thickned with a piece of <hi>Allum,</hi> according to the Directions preſcrib'd for Hurts in the <hi>Withers.</hi> If you cannot prevent Suppuration, proceed as in the above-mention'd Caſe, making a Paſſage to let out the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' you ſhou'd even open the Sore to the Bone; and continue to dreſs it, as you were taught before in the Cure of Wounds.</p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:179659:316"/>
                     <p>After you have pierc'd the Swelling with a hot Iron, as for Hurts in the <hi>Withers,</hi> draw out the Tents twice a Day, <hi>ſyrenge</hi> the Holes with the <hi>Waters</hi> for <hi>Gun-ſhot-Wounds,</hi> and beſmear the Tents with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> chafing the whole Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with the ſame Ointment, and covering it with a Woolly Lamb-Skin, to ſecure the Wound againſt the Injuries of the Air or Wind. But if the Swelling have no vent, as it happens not unfrequently, you cannot make a perfect Cure, and therefore you muſt immediately make an Inciſion, as in the <hi>Withers,</hi> piercing to the Bottom of the Sore, and taking away all the dead and rotten Fleſh. After you have wip'd off the Blood, apply hot Embers to the Wound, and the next Day waſh it with warm <hi>Wine, Urine,</hi> or a convenient <hi>Lye,</hi> renewing the Application of the hot Embers three or four times after the ſame manner, and dreſſing the Wound like a Hurt in the <hi>Withers.</hi> If the Tumour tend to Separation, and cannot be diſſolv'd, the beſt way is to rub the lower part of it with a <hi>Retoire,</hi> which opens the Swelling, and draws forth a red Water, and afterwards haſtens the Generation of the Matter. If the firſt Application of the <hi>Retoire</hi> increaſe the Tumour conſiderably, there will be no need of a ſecond: But if the Swelling be not much augmented, you moſt proceed to a ſecond Application. If you have no <hi>Retoire,</hi> open the Swelling in the lower part with a red hot Iron, if the Matter be already form'd. If the Matter that runs out be bloody, or only a red Water, you may conclude that the Swelling is too ſoon open'd; but if it be white, the Sore will heal of it ſelf, and your only care muſt be to keep the Hole open, and renew the Application of the red-hot Iron in caſe of Neceſſity. We are oftentimes oblig'd, if the Matter take up a large ſpace, to make ſeveral Holes with a red-hot Iron, that we may have the Conveniency of thruſting a Tent from one Hole to another, for the more ſpeedy uniting of the Skin to the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>If the Matter that runs out be <hi>Black,</hi> you have reaſon to fear a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and muſt immediately ſearch the bottom of the Sore with your Probe; for 'tis a certain Sign that the Seat of the Matter is remote, and the ſureſt way is to make a large Inciſion to the bottom of the Sore, with a Razor, and ſo dip the Bolſters of Flax in the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> or <hi>Lime-Water</hi> with <hi>Sublimate,</hi> ſtopping the Wound with Tents, and anointing all the external parts of it with the <hi>Duke's Ointment.</hi> If you perceive the Matter that runs out next Day to be very ſtinking, 'tis a ſign of great Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and therefore you muſt cut away all the corrupt Fleſh, till it appear fair and clean; ſtrew the Sore with Salt, and afterwards for the greater Security waſh it with the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> or the <hi>Yellow-Water,</hi> as before, applying the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> about the Sore to all the parts from whence you ſuſpect the Matter may come. Afterwards when you perceive no more dead or rotten Fleſh, ſtrew the inſide of the Sore with <hi>Salt,</hi> and apply a <hi>Deterſive,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Neat-herd's Ointment</hi> for <hi>Gauling,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> mixt with <hi>Aqua-fortis;</hi> and when it begins to grow of a fair red Colour, dreſs it with <hi>Schmit's</hi> or the <hi>Doctor's Ointment,</hi> uſing your utmoſt Diligence to prevent a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> in the <hi>Summer;</hi> for during the <hi>Winter</hi> Wounds are not ſo much ſubject to that fatal inconveniency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lapis Mirabilis</hi> is good to reſiſt Corruption, as alſo the above-mention'd <hi>Vulnerary-Water,</hi> and for want of that the <hi>Yellow-Water;</hi> but the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beſides ſeveral others; all theſe Remedies ought to be apply'd in caſe of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when the Matter that runs out appears of a <hi>Black</hi> Colour, which is one of the greateſt ſigns of Corruption.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot ſtop the Blood after the opening of an <hi>Abſceſs,</hi> ſear the part; for beſides the conveniency of ſtanching the Flux of Blood, the falling away of the Scab will promote the Cure; and at laſt when 'tis time to compleat the Cure, the regular application of the <hi>Hermit's Ointment</hi> will quickly perform the Work.</p>

                        <p>Take <hi>Hog's Greaſe</hi> and <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> of each one pound; melt the <hi>Greaſe</hi> in the <hi>Oil,</hi> and after they have boil'd a little, add two handfuls of the freſh Roots of <hi>Sharp-pointed Dock,</hi> beaten and ſlic'd ſmall. Continue to boil for the ſpace of half an Hour, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from time to time; after which add two handfuls of <hi>Self-heal,</hi> and boil half an Hour longer; then ſqueeze the Subſtances thro' a Linen Cloth in a Preſs, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Dreggs, put the ſtrain'd Liquor in a Baſon over a gentle Fire, with a pound of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and as ſoon as they begin to incorporate, add four Ounces of <hi>Verdigreeſe</hi> reduc'd to a fine Powder, boiling and ſtirring 'em over a ſlow Fire; then remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and add two Ounces of <hi>Borax</hi> beaten very ſmall, and ſix Ounces of <hi>unſlak'd Lime</hi> in very fine Po wder, ſtirring 'em till they be quite cold.</p>
                        <p>This Ointment will be of a lovely <hi>Green</hi> Colour. When you have occaſion to uſe it, apply it cold to the Wounds, and ſtrew 'em with the Powder of <hi>old Ropes,</hi> powdering the Tents with the ſame.</p>
                        <p>It cleanſes, heals, conſolidates, and cicatrizes the <hi>Wound,</hi> without hurting it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will convince you of its Excellency.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CX. <hi>Of</hi> Waters <hi>for</hi> Gun-Shot Wounds, <hi>or</hi> Vulnerary Potions.</head>
                     <p>'TIS not always convenient to make large Inciſions in <hi>Gun-ſhot Wounds,</hi> eſpecially in the Army during the Heat of the Summer, where there are no places to ſhelter the Horſes, either from the Sun or from Flies.</p>
                     <p>To diſcover the bottom and depth of theſe Wounds, you muſt ſearch them with a long Iron Probe, placing the Horſe in the ſame poſture he was in when he receiv'd the Shot. The Wounds by a <hi>Muſquet</hi> Bullet are uſually ſo deep, that 'tis impoſſible to reach the bottom of 'em with <hi>Ointments</hi> or <hi>Powders;</hi> and therefore 'twas neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent certain Remedies in form of <hi>VVaters</hi> to be injected ſeveral times a day. There is alſo a moiſtn'd Tent put into the Wound to keep it open; the Hole is covered with a wet Linnen Cloth, and half a pint of the ſame <hi>VVater</hi> is given inwardly to the Horſe once a day. Thus ſeveral Wounds are happily cur'd, that wou'd have certainly prov'd fatal without the aſſiſtance of theſe Remedies. 'Tis true, this Method is not always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs, but at leaſt a man has the ſatisfaction of thinking that his Horſe did not periſh by his neglect.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be ſeiz'd with a Fever, you muſt adminiſter <hi>Clyſters</hi> prepar'd with the <hi>Scoriae of Antimony,</hi> and abſtain from the inward uſe of the above-mention'd <hi>VVaters,</hi> which are compos'd of hot Ingredients, and wou'd conſequently augment the heat and agitation of the humours, and precipitate 'em on the wounded part. But 'tis frequently obſerv'd that very large Wounds in Horſes are not accompany'd with a Fever; nor muſt we condemn theſe Medicines for Horſes, tho' the uſe of 'em be almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aboliſh'd for Men, unleſs among the <hi>Switzers,</hi> where they are ſtill in great Credit.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXI. <hi>Of</hi> Wounds <hi>or</hi> Hurts <hi>on the</hi> Paſtern-Joint, <hi>and other</hi> Nervous <hi>or</hi> Sinewy <hi>Parts.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> is a very conſiderable Part, full of <hi>Sinews</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and conſequently very ſenſible of Pain. <hi>Wounds</hi> in this Part are very dangerous, when they are deep, and when the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Ligaments</hi> receive the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes when a Horſe happens to ſlip or fall, he has the Misfortune to be prick'd with a piece of Wood or Iron, which pierces the Skin, and if it enter into the Part, tho' but a very little way, you may certainly conclude, that the <hi>Sinew</hi> is cut, or at leaſt bruis'd. If it were a ſimple Wound it might be eaſily and ſpeedily heal'd; but there are ſo many <hi>Sinews</hi> about this Part, that for the moſt part ſome of 'em are hurt. Wounds in the <hi>Sinews</hi> are very dangerous, for the leaſt Hurt they receive ſpoils the Motion of the Part, and even all the Neighbouring parts ſuffer very conſiderably by reaſon of their mutual Communication.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as your Horſe is hurt or wounded in the <hi>Paſtern</hi> or <hi>Fetlock-Joint,</hi> if he be very Lame, you muſt immediately let him Blood in the Neck, to make a <hi>Revulſion,</hi> and to prevent the falling down of the Humours upon the Part; Feed him with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> giving him no Oats, and charge the whole Leg with the <hi>red Honey-Charge,</hi> or for want of that with <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> boil'd with <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Flower,</hi> or with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier.</hi> Chafe the Joint with ſtrong <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and apply to the Wound a Bolſter of Flax with <hi>Diapalma</hi> melted in a little <hi>Oil of Roſes.</hi> Then lay the <hi>Pultiſs</hi> deſcrib'd at the end of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> about the whole Joint, to allay the Pain, that the Horſe may be able to ſet his Foot to the Ground.</p>
                     <p>The next Day bleed him again, for there is nothing more profitable for Horſes that are Wounded in this Part, than <hi>Bleeding,</hi> repeated two or three times when the Wound is freſh. It makes a Revulſion of the Humours, allays the Inflammation, and promotes the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Dreſs the Leg every Day after the ſame manner, renewing the Application of the <hi>Charge</hi> or <hi>Ointment,</hi> and laying on the <hi>Pultiſs</hi> as before. If the Matter appear white and well digeſted, 'tis a very good ſign, and you may expect a ſpeedy Cure, by perſiſting in this Method. If the Hole be at the top of the Joint, and you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by examining it with a Probe, that it reaches downwards, after two or three Days you muſt pierce the Skin at the bottom of the Sore with a red-hot Iron to give a vent to the Matter that wou'd otherwiſe ſtagnate in the Joint as in a Bag; but you muſt only pierce the Skin, without touching any other Part, and ſtop the Hole with a Tent dipt in the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> after which you may dreſs the Joint as before.</p>
                     <p>If the Maſter-Sinew be gourded, ſwoll'n, hard, and hot, if inſtead of well concocted Matter, only <hi>Red-Water</hi> (which is a Nervous Juice) run out of the Sore; and if the Horſe fears to ſet down his Foot, you have reaſon to ſuſpect the event; and the beſt way in this caſe is to <hi>hang up</hi> the Horſe to eaſe his Legs; for if he cannot imitate thoſe Horſes who lie conſtantly, and even eat in that Poſture; or if he be not vigorous enough to riſe again; or of the number of thoſe Horſes who are naturally ſo heavy and unweildy, that the apprehenſion of not being able to riſe again if they ſhould lie down, keeps 'em perpetually ſtanding; he runs the hazard of being <hi>Founder'd</hi> if he be not <hi>hung up.</hi> This Method of <hi>hanging up</hi> a Horſe is certainly very troubleſome, but 'tis ſometimes neceſſary; nor ſhou'd it ever be attempted in any other caſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Nervous Water,</hi> that runs out of Sores in the <hi>Paſtern-Joint,</hi> ſometimes the Matter that comes forth is <hi>Yellow</hi> and tough, reſembling <hi>Glue,</hi> but much harder, and ſometimes Slimy. This is certainly a very bad ſign, for the Matter is in ſome reſpect the Marrow of the <hi>Sinew,</hi> or rather the Subſtance by which 'tis nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, and conſequently when 'tis depriv'd of its uſual and neceſſary ſupplies of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, it remains dry, wither'd, uncapable of Motion, and ſhrinks up, leaving the <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> diſtorted and bending forward. As ſoon as you perceive this yellow
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:179659:318"/>and hard Matter (which for the moſt part is alſo ſtinking) with the other above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Symptoms, namely, the ſwelling and heat of the <hi>Maſter-ſinew,</hi> and the Horſe's holding up his Foot from the Ground, you muſt, in the firſt place, allay the Pain with good <hi>Honey-Charges,</hi> and then proceed to <hi>give the Fire</hi> all along the <hi>Sinew,</hi> and round the <hi>Paſtern-Joint,</hi> drawing the Lines or Raſes very near each other, without piercing the Skin; then apply a convenient <hi>Plaiſter</hi> or <hi>Sear-Cloth</hi> to the burnt Part, cover it with Saddle-ſtuffings, ſet on a Shooe on the Sore Foot, jetting out two Inches at the Toe like a Mule's-Shooe, and renew the Application of the <hi>Anodyn Pultiſs,</hi> with the Bolſters or Flax, as before; the ſame Day give the Horſe a <hi>Clyſter</hi> with <hi>Sal-Polychreſt,</hi> to allay the beating of his Flanks, caus'd by the Pain of the burning, and continue the uſe of theſe <hi>Clyſters</hi> for five or ſix Days. <hi>Note,</hi> That you muſt never <hi>give the Fire</hi> along the Sinew, till you have aſſwag'd the violent Pain of the Leg with good <hi>Honey-Charges</hi> or <hi>Ointments;</hi> and before theſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations you muſt frequently chafe the <hi>Sinew</hi> and <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The deſign of <hi>giving the Fire</hi> is to ſtop the courſe of the Nervous Humour, which leaving the Sinews, deprives 'em of Nouriſhment; for <hi>Fire</hi> is the moſt powerful <hi>Reſtringent,</hi> and this is the only way to prevent irrecoverable Lameneſs, and the diſtortion of the <hi>Paſtern-Joint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The uſe of the above-mention'd Remedies muſt be continu'd, till the Sores on the Joint, and thoſe occaſion'd by the Fire be abſolutely heal'd; and if the Horſe be <hi>hung up,</hi> you muſt take him down as ſoon as you perceive that he can ſet his Foot to the Ground.</p>
                     <p>If, during the progreſs of the Cure, the Horſe loſe his Appetite, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Accident in theſe Caſes, eſpecially when the Grief is ſeated in the <hi>Paſtern-Joint</hi> of the <hi>Hinder-Leg,</hi> tye a <hi>Chewing-Ball</hi> to the Bit, and make him champ upon it every Morning, till his Appetite be reſtor'd.</p>
                     <p>To prevent his being <hi>Founder'd,</hi> which is the uſual effect not only of this, but of ſeveral other Diſtempers that are accompany'd with a violent Pain in the Legs or Feet, give him <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> in Powder, for five or ſix Days together, an Ounce every Day, in a Point of Wine, keeping him Bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after every Doſe; for this Medicine contributes effectually to the Cure of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                     <p>I promis'd to communicate the deſcription of an <hi>Anodyn</hi> and <hi>Aſtringent Pultiſs,</hi> that is, a Remedy to aſſwage Pain, and ſtop the defluxion of Humours.</p>

                     <p>THis Subject is ſo excellently handl'd in a Pamphlet Printed at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear tranſcribing it without the leaſt alteration; and to begin with the Printer's Addreſs to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Secret which I diſcover, ſays he, is as uſeful and neceſſary as 'tis rare, and hitherto unknown. It diſcovers the infallible Cure of a Diſtemper, for which <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> have not yet preſcrib'd a certain Remedy, and all the hope of thoſe that are ſeiz'd with it depends either on a Miracle, or dipping in the Sea; whereas there are many places ſo remote both from <hi>St. Hubert</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> that 'tis impoſſible for thoſe who inhabit 'em to have recourſe to either. The uſefulneſs of this Remedy is attended with another very conſiderable advantage, I mean, the eaſineſs of its Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for without ſearching the Shop of an Apothecary, the Ingredients that enter its Compoſition are to be found every where, except one that is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and might be Planted or Sow'd in every Garden. The Knowledge of this Secret was confin'd for ſeveral Ages to a certain Family, who freely communicated its ſalutary Influences to thoſe who ſtood in need of 'em, but ſtill kept the Secret as an honourable Inheritance of the Family. It was lately diſcover'd to me by a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of the ſame Family, with an obliging Permiſſion to Communicate it to the Publick; which I do the more willingly, ſince he aſſur'd me, that the efficacy of this Remedy is confirm'd by ſo many Experiments, and ſo univerſally eſteem'd in the Country where his Family reſides, that tho' it be not above ſeven ſmall Leagues diſtant from the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the Waters of which are known to be a ſure Remedy for that Diſtemper; yet all the Inhabitants of the Country, who have the Misfortune to be bitten by Mad-Beaſts, chuſe rather to uſe this Medicine, than to have recourſe to the Sea. The ſame Perſon added, That it has hitherto preſerv'd all thoſe who took it, whether <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Cattle,</hi> from the <hi>Madneſs</hi> occaſion'd by thoſe Accidents; and that he was lately inform'd, by one of his Relations, That he had ſeen ſeveral Perſons Cur'd by it, after they had ſuffer'd one or two Fits of <hi>Madneſs.</hi> 'Tis hop'd, that the Publick will receive favourably ſo rich and precious a Treaſure, which I communicate with the <hi>Father</hi>'s Permiſſion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I dare confidently warrant the Succeſs of this Remedy, ſince I have conſtantly obſerv'd, that it anſwers the Deſire and Expectation of thoſe who make uſe of it; and I know a conſiderable Family, about thirty Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Secret, and communicated to the Neighbours, the advantageous effects of ſo noble a Remedy, which they believ'd was only known to themſelves; but as ſoon as they were convinc'd of their Miſtake, by the Publication of this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, they imparted the Receipt to all thoſe who deſir'd it.</p>

                           <p>The Wound being thus cleans'd, take <hi>Rue, Sage,</hi> and <hi>Field-Daiſies,</hi> both Leaves and Flowers, of each one Pugil, or as much as you can lift with the ends of your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which is ſufficient for one Perſon and one Wound; but the quantity muſt be proportionably encreas'd, if there be more Perſons or Wounds to be heal'd; and beſides, you may take ſomewhat more of the <hi>Daiſies</hi> than of the other two Herbs.

                           <p>This done, pour half a Glaſs of <hi>White-wine,</hi> or (for want of that) any other ſort of Wine, on the remaining part of the Maſh, which will amount to the quantity of a large Hen's Egg; incorporate 'em together in a Mortar, and ſqueeze 'em thro' a Linen Cloth, giving the ſtrain'd Liquor to the Patient to be drunk faſting, and ordering him afterwards to waſh his Mouth with Wine and Water, to take away, or qualifie the unpleaſant taſte of the Potion, and to abſtain from eating three Hours after.

                     <p>THo' I have already propos'd an excellent Remedy for the Cure of Horſes, and other Cattle that are bitten by <hi>Mad Beaſts,</hi> 'twill not be improper to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join a Method of Cure appropriated to the bitings of certain venemous Creatures reſembling <hi>Mice,</hi> but of a greyer Colour and ſharper Noſe. The biting of theſe Creatures are ſo dangerous and fatal, that Horſes and Dogs die of it, without a ſpeedy and well-regulated Aſſiſtance. And even Cats who eat 'em are waſted by the Malignity of thoſe little Animals, and die in a kind of Conſumption. They breed among rotten Straw in Barns and Stables.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is bitten by one of theſe <hi>Mice</hi> in the <hi>Paſtern</hi> or <hi>Fet-lock</hi> Joint, the next Day the Part ſwells, and the Tumour aſcends to the <hi>Hough,</hi> ſtretching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Cods</hi> and <hi>Fundament,</hi> which ſwell to a prodigious height, and the Horſe dies in forty eight Hours, if a Remedy be not ſeaſonably apply'd.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes theſe Animals bite Horſes under the <hi>Belly,</hi> which ſwells extremely, and the Tumour either riſes towards the <hi>Throat,</hi> or extends to the <hi>Sheath,</hi> and grows ſo exceſſively big, that the Horſe is quickly kill'd by its Malignity.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you perceive the Swelling, if it be in the <hi>Leg,</hi> tie a Ribbon or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the breadth of an Inch above the Swelling, to ſtop its Progreſs, and beat the ſwoll'n part with a Branch of a <hi>Goosberry</hi> Buſh, till it be all over bloody. Then chafe it with a large quantity of <hi>Orvietan</hi> or <hi>Treacle,</hi> and at the ſame time make the Horſe ſwallow an Ounce of either of theſe Medicines in Wine; the next Day anoint the part again, and exhibit inwardly half an Ounce of the ſame Remedy.</p>
                     <p>If you have neither <hi>Treacle</hi> nor <hi>Orvietan,</hi> anoint the ſwoll'n Parts with the <hi>Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of Kermes, Mithridate,</hi> or the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> mixt with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and exhibit inwardly a convenient Doſe of the ſame Remedy with which you anoint the Part.</p>
                     <p>After the ſecond Doſe and anointing of the ſwoll'n Leg, untie the Garter, chafe the Leg with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and ſow a Cloth dipt in the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> about the Swelling; after which rub the Part with the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> to aſſwage the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The ſame Remedy cures the bitings of all ſorts of Venemous Creatures that are follow'd with a Swelling; but you muſt never forget to preſerve the Heart from Malignity with proper Cordials.</p>
                     <p>I never try'd this Method for the biting of <hi>Serpents,</hi> whoſe Poiſon is ſo ſubtil, that immediately it reaches the Heart; for I'm perſuaded that the <hi>Eſſence of Vipers</hi> is the only effectual Remedy in thoſe Caſes.</p>

                     <p>I Shall in the Second Part inform the Reader how he may know a Horſe thatis ſubject to theſe Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> is a difficulty of Breathing caus'd by ſtuffing of the Lungs, or Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Veins and Arteries, eſpecially in the Paſſages or Chanels of the Lungs, and accompany'd with a beating and heaving in the Flanks, and a Dilatation or ſtretching of the Noſtrils. The Diſeaſe is ſeated in the Lungs, and proceeds from an Obſtruction of the Paſſages by ſtagnating and thick flegmatick Humours. 'Tis
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:179659:320"/>to be obſerv'd, that the Lungs conſume more Nouriſhment than any Part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſince they are nouriſh'd only by the pureſt and moſt ſubtil or bilious part of the Blood, as it appears evidently from the Conſideration of thoſe Animals who are deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tute of Lungs; for they may be almoſt ſaid to live upon nothing. Thus <hi>Fiſhes</hi> who have no <hi>Lungs</hi> are eaſily fatten'd by a ſmall quantity of Nouriſhment; and even it ſeems not improbable that the <hi>Kidneys</hi> were deſign'd by Nature for the Evacuation of the Impurities of the <hi>Lungs;</hi> for <hi>Fiſhes</hi> are equally deſtitute of both theſe Parts; and uſually Horſes who are troubl'd ſome Days with a Flux of <hi>Urine,</hi> are ſeiz'd with a <hi>Cough</hi> by reaſon of the drineſs of their <hi>Lungs.</hi> I thought fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert theſe Remarks for the Information of thoſe who have lean and waſted Horſes; for if the <hi>Lungs</hi> be affected, they will hardly ever be able to fatten 'em, becauſe that Part will conſume a conſiderable part of the Nouriſhment, which otherwiſe wou'd have been turn'd to Fleſh; and beſides, 'tis obſerv'd that all <hi>Purſive</hi> Horſes <hi>ſtale</hi> very much during the Cure, becauſe the Impurities of the <hi>Lungs</hi> are voided that way. This is a very true and curious Obſervation, and was never mention'd by any Writer on this Subject, or inſerted in any Book, whether <hi>French, Italian, German,</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Veſſels and other ſpermatical Parts that enter the Compoſition of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> they will appear to be <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dry.</hi> If we take a View of the fleſhy, ſoft, and ſpongy Subſtance of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> they ſeem to be <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi> and if we reflect on their Lightneſs and aptneſs for Motion, we can hardly forbear concluding that they are of a <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt</hi> Nature.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lungs</hi> are divided into ſeveral parts call'd <hi>Lobes</hi> which ſurround the Heart, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially into two, by a double Membrane, which in Humane Bodies is call'd the <hi>Midriff:</hi> They are of a ſpongy Subſtance, eaſily dilateable, which ſucks in the Air, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels it again with ſome ſmoaky and fuliginous Vapours, by the two different Motions of Reſpiration. This Part is fuller of <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> than any other Part of the Body, which make it ſo ſubject to Inflammations and Obſtructions, as the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are either hot and ſubtil, or thick and heavy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> proceeds from ſeveral Cauſes: Thus, a ſlight Obſtruction in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> in the <hi>Veins,</hi> or ſome of the <hi>Arteries,</hi> may cauſe a ſhortneſs of Breath, which is cur'd with eaſie Remedies.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Diſtemper proceeds uſually from ſome Humours ſtagnating in the Paſſages of the Lungs, in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> or in the <hi>Arteries;</hi> for the free Circulation of the Blood being ſtopt, a great quantity of it gathering together in one place, preſſes the Ducts or Paſſages of Reſpiration, and obſtructs the Freedom of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: When the Blood is hot and boiling, it quickly degenerates into Putrefaction, and cauſes a dangerous Inflammation in that Part, which muſt be allay'd with powerful Coolers.</p>
                     <p>This Obſtruction is uſually caus'd by flegmatick and <hi>pituitous</hi> Humours; and tho' in this Caſe 'tis not attended with ſuch violent Symptoms, as are produc'd by the other Cauſes of this Diſtemper, 'tis very ſtubborn, and hardly to be conquer'd by the beſt Medicines; for thoſe ſlimy and tough Humours cannot eaſily be looſen'd and ſeparated from the Parts where they ſtick, and therefore the Cure muſt be attempted with cutting and attenuating Remedies. And beſides, ſince the Motion of the Blood is obſtructed, and that Liquor depriv'd of the Advantage of Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, this kind of <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> is quickly accompany'd with a ſort of Putrefaction, and ſome other Symptoms, which ſeem to proceed from a <hi>hot</hi> Principle; tho' the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe is rarely of that Nature.</p>
                     <p>'Tis plain that <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> proceeds from a <hi>cold</hi> Principle, and yet the Symptoms that attend it ſeem to denote the <hi>heat</hi> of the Cauſe, tho' it be really of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Nature; for this Diſtemper is uſually occaſion'd by <hi>pituitous</hi> Humours, and the thick Flegm which ſtuffs the Paſſages, and cauſes a difficulty of Reſpiration. This may ſerve to diſcover the Error of thoſe who turn out their <hi>Purſive</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>Graſs,</hi> and are uſually much ſurpriz'd when they take 'em up with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to confine 'em to <hi>dry Feeding,</hi> to find them ſhorter-winded then ever; for the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Graſs</hi> augments the Flegm, and makes it thicker and heavier, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more apt to obſtruct the Motion of the Blood and Air in the <hi>Lungs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be objected that <hi>Graſs</hi> has been ſometimes obſerv'd to relieve <hi>Purſive</hi> Horſes; 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe that in ſuch a Caſe there was an Inflammation occaſion'd by a redundancy of Blood, that might be cool'd and allay'd by the coldneſs of the <hi>Graſs,</hi> which moiſtening the <hi>Lungs,</hi> might give ſome eaſe to the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:179659:320"/>Horſe ſo long as he continu'd to feed on it. And after a due Conſideration of this Caſe, I am perſuaded of the Juſtneſs of that General Rule, which enjoyns a total abſtinence from <hi>Graſs</hi> to all <hi>ſhort-winded</hi> Horſes, ſince the Benefit they receive by that ſort of Nouriſhment laſts no longer than they actually feed on it.</p>
                     <p>The moſt dangerous kind of <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> is that which is occaſion'd by hard Riding and violent Labour; for ſometimes in ſuch caſes a Vein is open'd, and the Blood falls into the Cavity of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> where it putrefies and turns to Matter, which, for want of a Paſſage, ſtagnates about the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and breeds an Ulcer in 'em. And the danger is ſo much the greater, becauſe a large Ulcer, from what Cauſe ſoever it proceeds, waſtes and conſumes the Horſe to ſuch a degree, that 'tis impoſſible to make him thrive, or render him fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is uſually caus'd by the heat of the Aliments by which the Horſe is nouriſh'd, as old <hi>Clover,</hi> too great abundance of <hi>Hay,</hi> and ſeveral other kinds of Food; and the ſame Infirmity proceeds for want of Exerciſe, by reaſon of the Multitude of Flegmatick and Corrupt Humours that are bred in a Horſe's Body, and in a particular manner affect the <hi>Lungs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Watering of a Horſe when he is over-heated is apt to make him <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When this Diſtemper is hereditary, 'tis abſolutely incurable; for the Horſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his Body the Principle of the Defect which can never be corrected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by the uſe of Remedies. A Natural Weakneſs of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which renders 'em ſuſceptible of the corrupt Humours that abound in the Body, can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd by Art; and the ſame may be affirm'd of the irregular Structure or Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Part, as when 'tis either too narrow, or faſten'd to the Sides.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is curable in the beginning, eſpecially in young Horſes, if it be not accompany'd with a <hi>Cough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purgative</hi> Remedies are of little uſe in this Diſtemper, ſince the Flegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from which it uſually proceeds, can never be evacuated by theſe Medicines, and the only Paſſages that give any hope of drawing thoſe Humours from the <hi>Lungs,</hi> are either the <hi>Kidneys, Noſtrils,</hi> or <hi>Mouth:</hi> And ſince all Evacuations that tend <hi>upwards</hi> are contrary to the Nature of Horſes, as they who are acquainted with the internal Oeconomy or Diſpoſition of a Horſe's Body, will readily acknowledge, 'tis plain that the Cure muſt be perform'd by <hi>Cutting, Attenuating,</hi> or <hi>Diuretic</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is accompany'd with a dry and often-returning <hi>Cough,</hi> or when the Motion of Reſpiration reaches as far as the <hi>Croup,</hi> and appears viſibly on the Rump, you may conclude the Cure to be abſolutely impoſſible. If your Horſe void Flegmatick Humours by his Noſtrils and Mouth, you will find it a very hard Task to reſtore him to his Health.</p>

                        <p>If a diligent Obſervation of the various Circumſtances with which the Diſeaſe is accompany'd, convince you that your Horſes <hi>Lungs</hi> are very much <hi>heated,</hi> among all the Remedies that I propoſe, you muſt chooſe ſuch as are moſt <hi>temperate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if you perceive no ſign of <hi>heat,</hi> you may uſe the moſt <hi>cutting</hi> Remedies. However, I will endeavour to moderate and qualifie 'em all to ſuch a degree that they may be able to looſen and remove the Obſtructions of the <hi>Lungs</hi> without heating 'em; and after I have propos'd the moſt gentle Remedies at firſt, I ſhall gradually proceed to the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                        <p>The Cure ought always to be attempted in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Horſe muſt eat no Hay; and after the ordering of his Diet, you may prepare and exhibit the following Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Melt two pounds of <hi>Lead</hi> in a convenient Veſſel, and removing it from the Fire, ſtir it till it be reduc'd to Powder; then continuing to ſtir it without intermiſſion add two Pounds of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> in Powder, and ſtir 'em together till they be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorporated. Give your Horſe an Ounce of this Powder every Day in <hi>moiſten'd Bran;</hi> and it will not only give him Eaſe, but not improbably compleat the Cure, if your Horſe be young, and the Diſeaſe not very inveterate.</p>
                        <p>If your Horſe's <hi>Lungs</hi> be heated, with a violent beating in his Flanks, <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> may give him Relief; but by reaſon of the coldneſs of that Remedy, 'twill be convenient to add half the quantity of <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> or <hi>Nutmegs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:179659:321"/>
                        <p>Thus you may give him an Ounce of <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> with half an Ounce of <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs</hi> or <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> and continue after the ſame manner for a conſiderable time. If he refuſe to eat the <hi>Bran,</hi> give him the Remedies in a Pint of Wine, after they have ſtood in Infuſion a whole Night, keeping him bridl'd two Hours before, and three Hours after every Doſe, and perſiſting in this Method for fifteen Days. If his Belly be looſn'd by the continu'd uſe of this Remedy, you may entertain more certain hopes of the Cure; for ſo it will evacuate the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Humours, dilute the Flegm that cauſes the Obſtructions, clear and unſtop the Paſſages that cool the <hi>Lungs,</hi> purifie the Blood, and reſiſt Corruption. If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe be not very ſtubborn and deſperate, this Remedy will at laſt mitigate its Violence; and ſince that which gives Eaſe may at length perfect the Cure, you ought to perſiſt in a careful Obſervance of this Method, if you perceive that the Horſe receives any benefit by it.</p>
                        <p>This Remedy is moſt proper for <hi>young</hi> Horſes, who oftentimes ſtand in need of <hi>cooling</hi> Medicines, which is ſeldom or never the Caſe of thoſe that are <hi>old.</hi>

                           <hi>Another Remedy for</hi> Purſiveneſs.</head>
                        <p>The proper time for preparing this Remedy is when the Herbs are endu'd with their entire Virtues, eſpecially when <hi>Broom</hi> begins to put out its Flowers.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Mallows, White Mullein, Colts-Foot,</hi> Green <hi>Broom</hi> Tops of the ſame Year, <hi>Succory, Bramble</hi> Tops, Bitter <hi>Succory, Hyſop,</hi> and White <hi>Horehound,</hi> of each three Handfuls. Chop 'em ſmall, and put 'em into a Kettle capable of containing a Pail full of Water; fill the Kettle with Water, and boil the Herbs two Hours, after which remove the Veſſel from the Fire, adding a quarter of a Pound of Juice of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> and ten handfuls of <hi>Broom</hi> Flowers. After 'tis half cold, ſtrain out the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and diſſolve in it two Pounds of <hi>Honey;</hi> then melt a like quantity of <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in an Iron Spoon or Ladle, and caſt it into the Decoction; and after it ſinks to the Bottom, take it out, melt it a ſecond time, and throw it again into the Liquor, repeating the ſame Operation five or ſix times, that the Decoction may be impregnated with the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> After you have kept your Horſe bridl'd two Hours in the Morning, give him a fourth part of this <hi>Potion</hi> with a Horn, walking him gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly half an Hour after it; then give him another fourth part, walking him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the next Day make him drink the other half, obſerving the ſame Directions; after which ſuffer him to reſt one Day, and on the fourth renew the Potion for two Days, as before, which muſt be follow'd by a Day of repoſe, and the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod continu'd till he has drunk the Decoction ten Days, and reſted four.</p>
                        <p>In the Intervals he muſt eat neither <hi>Hay</hi> nor <hi>Oats,</hi> but <hi>Bran</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi> during the uſe of this Remedy, and you will find him if not abſolutely cur'd, at leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much eas'd; for the Operation of the Medicine depends on the State or Degree of the Diſeaſe when it was firſt exhibited.</p>

                        <p>The former Remedy is only proper in the Summer, and therefore ſince Horſes are troubl'd with this Diſtemper in other Seaſons of the Year, you may obſerve the following Method.</p>
                        <p>Give your Horſe a ſufficient quantity of <hi>White Mullein</hi> chopt ſmall, and mixt with moiſten'd <hi>Oats;</hi> the larger you make the Doſe, the more effectually it will work.</p>
                        <p>If he will not eat <hi>Wheat-Straw,</hi> moiſten his <hi>Hay;</hi> and for his ordinary Drink diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve a Pound of <hi>Honey</hi> in a Pail-full of Water; for tho' at firſt he may ſeem unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to drink it, he will quickly be reconcil'd to it.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen Horſes abſtain from drinking fifty Hours together; but at laſt thirſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind 'em to drink the <hi>Hony'd Water.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The continu'd uſe of this Remedy will either cure the Horſe, or at leaſt make him fit for Service. You muſt give the <hi>Mullein</hi> as long as you can; but 'twill be ſufficient to make him drink <hi>Hony'd Water</hi> for a Month, more or leſs, according to the ſtubbornneſs of the Diſtemper; and in the mean time the Horſe may be ridden.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXV. <hi>The way of Exhibiting</hi> Honey <hi>to Horſes that are</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five, <hi>or troubl'd with Diſorders in the</hi> Flanks, <hi>and other Diſtempers.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HOney</hi> is an excellent Remedy for lean Horſes, who are troubl'd with Diſorders in the <hi>Flanks,</hi> or tir'd and ſpent with hard Exerciſe; for it comforts the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and allays the ſharpneſs of the Humours. But ſince it muſt be given Methodically, I thought fit to inſert all the particular Directions that muſt be obſerv'd in thoſe caſes; Some give it with <hi>Oats</hi> to Horſes that are <hi>Short-Winded.</hi> Nor do I condemn this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but 'tis incomparably better to make the Horſe eat it hot with <hi>Bran,</hi> if he can poſſibly overcome his Reluctancy; for there are ſome Horſes ſo obſtinate that 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible to make 'em eat it hot; and therefore you muſt either ſuffer it to cool, or not heat it at all.</p>
                     <p>Some mix a Pound of <hi>Honey</hi> with two Pecks of <hi>Bran,</hi> ſtirring 'em together with a little luke-warm Water.</p>
                     <p>Others boil two Buſhels of <hi>Bran</hi> in a Kettle, with a proportionable quantity of <hi>Honey</hi> and Water, and give it to their Horſes.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe Methods are good, and the <hi>Honey</hi> prepar'd either way, cures the <hi>Cough,</hi> takes away the diſturbance in the Flanks, and fattens the Horſe, if he be lean and waſted after long Fatigues.</p>
                     <p>This is an excellent way of giving <hi>Honey;</hi> you may begin with half a Pound, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Doſe afterwards to a whole Pound, and at laſt to two Pounds a Day, one in the Morning, and the other at Night, and preparing the <hi>Honey</hi> according to either of the above-mention'd Methods.</p>
                     <p>If you wou'd have the <hi>Honey</hi> perform its Operation effectually, and reſolve to give a large quantity of it, you muſt neither ride your Horſe, nor give him any Oats, feeding him only with <hi>Bran,</hi> and perſiſting in an exact obſervance of this Method till his Body be ſufficiently purg'd; for tho' the <hi>Honey</hi> occaſion a copious Evacuation, you muſt ſtill continue to give him the ſame quantity of it, till the Purgation ceaſe, provided it do not exceed ſix Days; but if it continues to the ſeventh you muſt lay aſide the uſe of the <hi>Honey,</hi> tho' this Caution be very rarely neceſſary; for the heat of the Evacuation ſeldom or never laſts above three or four Days together, tho' the Horſe continue ſtill to take his uſual Doſes of <hi>Honey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſeen Horſes eat <hi>fifty Pounds</hi> of <hi>Honey</hi> before they were throughly purg'd; but at laſt they voided very ſtinking and corrupt Matter, and afterwards grew very Fat. This Example ought not to fright the Reader, for I only mention it as an extraordinary caſe; and if all Horſes requir'd ſo vaſt a quantity of <hi>Honey,</hi> the whole <hi>Indies</hi> cou'd not furniſh enough for ſo extraordinary an Expence. The only inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency that attends this Method, is, that the <hi>Worms</hi> that are in a Horſe's Body, are nouriſh'd and ſtrengthn'd by the ſweetneſs of the <hi>Honey,</hi> and afterwards vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him. To deſtroy theſe troubleſome Inſects, the uſual Method is to give the Horſe <hi>Rye</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> during the time of his eating <hi>Honey.</hi> The <hi>Rye</hi> is caſt into boiling Water, and immediately remov'd from the Fire; then the Water is ſuffer'd to cool, and the <hi>Rye</hi> laid on a Hurdle to drain. But without engaging in ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a Method, after he has taken all the <hi>Honey</hi> that you intend to give him, you may content your ſelf with giving him a Doſe of <hi>Aloes,</hi> which will kill all the Worms in his Body.</p>
                     <p>You may eaſily deſtroy <hi>Worms</hi> without <hi>Purgation,</hi> by giving the Horſe every Day an Ounce of <hi>Filings</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> or of fine <hi>Needles,</hi> mixt with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> for eight or ten Days together. The <hi>Steel</hi> being diſſolv'd by the penetrating <hi>Acid</hi> contain'd in the Stomach, the <hi>Vitriolic</hi> Particles exert their Force, and inſinuating themſelves a mong the Aliments, poyſon and deſtroy the Worms. Beſides, <hi>Steel</hi> is indu'd with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Faculty to open and clear the Paſſages, and conſequently makes way for the Blood, to nouriſh and fatten the Parts.</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:179659:322"/>
                     <p>Any <hi>Needle-maker</hi> will furniſh you with a ſufficient quantity of theſe <hi>Filings;</hi> and you may try the goodneſs of 'em, by throwing 'em againſt the Flame of a Candle, for they will take Fire like <hi>Gun-Powder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Twou'd be needleſs to alledge any Arguments to demonſtrate that the <hi>Vitriolic</hi> part of the <hi>Steel</hi> is diſſolv'd and ſeparated in the Stomach, and afterwards mixt with the digeſted Aliments, ſince the very Excrements of the Horſe, during the uſe of this Remedy, furniſh me with a convincing proof of the truth of that Aſſertion; for they appear black, ſhining, and ting'd with the <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> ſo long as the Horſe continues to take the Powder of <hi>Steel,</hi> and no longer. The <hi>Filings of Steel</hi> in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is an excellent Remedy, and the laborious ways of Preparing it produce the ſame effect in this caſe as in the Preparation of <hi>Pearls,</hi> deſtroying the efficacy of the Remedy inſtead of exalting its Virtues; and <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> teaches us on ſeveral occaſions, that <hi>Nature</hi> is a better Preparer of Medicines than <hi>Art.</hi> Any Phyſician may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally convinc'd of this Truth, by giving a Dram of the <hi>Filings of Steel</hi> every Day in ſome convenient <hi>Conſerve</hi> to his Patients, to open Obſtructions and deſtroy <hi>Worms;</hi> and the ſame may be given, with Succeſs, to Maids that are troubl'd with the <hi>Green-Sickneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or you may give the Horſe four Ounces of Powder of <hi>Cinnabar</hi> in a Pound of freſh Butter, which will not leave a Worm alive in his Body, and the Doſe may be repeated upon occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> is alſo an excellent Remedy, with a double quantity of the <hi>Cordial-Powder,</hi> that is, half an Ounce of <hi>Mercury,</hi> mixt with an Ounce of <hi>Powder.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXVI. <hi>A</hi> Powder <hi>for heat and diſturbance in the</hi> Flanks.</head>
                     <p>THE following Powder is of excellent uſe for Horſes that are troubl'd with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd <hi>Flanks,</hi> and begin to be <hi>Short-Winded,</hi> tho' it does not abſolutely Cure 'em. To keep their Flanks freſh and cool, you muſt give it once a Year for twenty Days together; by which Method I preſerv'd a Horſe as freſh as a Colt, for ſix Years, who was manifeſtly <hi>Short-Winded,</hi> but not much troubl'd with a <hi>Cough.</hi> Take <hi>Bay-Berries,</hi> gather'd from a <hi>Laurel-Tree</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Provence, Myrrh, Gentian,</hi> and <hi>Round Birthwort,</hi> of each eight Ounces; <hi>Agaric</hi> four Ounces; <hi>Saffron,</hi> two Drams; beat each Ingredient ſeverally to Powder, then mix and ſearce 'em thro' a fine Hair-Sieve. The Doſe is a Silver-Spoonful every Morning in a Quart of White-Wine, and the Horſe muſt be kept Bridl'd an Hour before, and as long after. Repeat the Doſe once a Day till the whole Powder be conſum'd; and if you have not the conveniency of giving it with a Horn, you may give it in <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> fifteen Days together, or longer.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Horſe may be moderately ridden, but you muſt never make him Sweat, if you can poſſibly avoid it: if his Body be full of corrupt Humours, they may hinder the Operation of the <hi>Powder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Experience will convince you of the uſefulneſs of this Remedy for Horſes that are troubl'd with the <hi>Flanks</hi> before they are evidently <hi>Purſive,</hi> for it cools their Flanks, and perfectly allays the diſturbances of thoſe Parts; and beſides, it gives eaſe for a time to thoſe that are <hi>Short-Winded.</hi> I am not ignorant, that 'tis the uſual Method of Farriers, to adminiſter <hi>Cooling</hi> Remedies to <hi>Purſive</hi> Horſes; but the efficacy of this Powder, which is of a very different Nature, muſt certainly oblige 'em to own, that tho' there are ſome ſigns of <hi>Heat</hi> in the Flanks, the original cauſe or principle of all theſe Diſturbances is <hi>Cold,</hi> that is, a viſcous and heavy Flegm, that obſtructs the Veins, or the Paſſages of reſpiration. And this obſervation may ſerve to deter all thoſe who are not perfectly acquainted with the Cauſes and Effects of a Diſeaſe, from attempting the Cure of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purgation</hi> is very troubleſome to <hi>Short-Winded</hi> Horſes, and therefore ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but in caſes of extream neceſſity you may looſen your Horſes Belly without any diſturbance, after the following manner.</p>
                     <div type="section">

                           <hi>How to</hi> Looſen <hi>a</hi> Purſive <hi>Horſe's</hi> Belly.</head>
                        <p>Keep your Horſe two Days without Drinking, and in the mean time give him his uſual allowance of Food, but you muſt not ride him; then offer him a Pail-full of Water, and as ſoon as he has ſwallow'd one Draught, pull up his Head, and reſtrain him from drinking more, till you have pour'd two Pounds of the beſt <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> into the Pail; after which, ſuffer him to drink up all the Water and Oil, which will looſen his Belly, and ſupple the ſurface of the Guts, that were dry'd by the heat occaſion'd by Putrefaction. Thus the Excrements or peccant Humours that were lodg'd in the Paſſages will be evacuated, without diſturbing or over-turning the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy or natural diſpoſition of the Body, and the Horſe will be very ſenſibly reliev'd, ſuppoſing that you were convinc'd by certain and evident ſigns of the neceſſity of <hi>Purgation.</hi> To prevent the loſs of the Oil, if the Horſe ſhould refuſe to drink it, you may make an Eſſay, by pouring a little Oil upon the Water, and offering it to the Horſe, for there are ſome Horſes who will not taſte it, tho' at the ſame time they are extreamly tormented with Thirſt, by reaſon of the averſion they have for all unctuous things; and therefore the ſureſt way is to give him two Pounds of freſh and ſweet <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> with a Horn, keeping him Bridl'd four Hours before, and as long after; for thus you need not make him abſtain ſo long from Drinking, as you muſt do if you give him the Oil mixt with Water; however, you may chooſe which Method you like beſt, but the laſt is certainly the ſureſt. After the <hi>Purgation</hi> you may repeat the uſe of the above-mention'd <hi>Powder,</hi> which in that caſe will operate very powerfully; and if, after all, the Horſe continue <hi>Short-Winded,</hi> you may conclude that the Cure will be very difficult, if not impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>If you adminiſter the Oil, without very apparent ſigns of an urgent neceſſity, you muſt expect to be allarm'd with the ill Conſequences of a <hi>Prepoſterous Purgation;</hi> for if your Horſe be of a Choleric Conſtitution, or have too much Fire in his Temper, he will abſolutely forſake his Meat, and ſwell eight or ten Hours after the Doſe in ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious a manner, that you wou'd think he was juſt ready to burſt: But the danger is not ſo great as the Swelling ſeems to threaten, and you may eaſily preſerve your Horſes Life by obſerving theſe Directions. After you have walk'd him half an Hour, give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of <hi>Beer,</hi> and the <hi>Scoriae of Antimony,</hi> ſuch as you will find deſcrib'd in ſeveral parts of this Book; half an Hour after walk him again for the ſpace of an Hour; and as ſoon as you bring him into the Stable inject another <hi>Clyſter,</hi> which will open your Horſe's Body, and produce a plentiful Evacuation for twenty four Hours; nor muſt you be ſurpriz'd, if he refuſe to eat during that time, for his Appetite will return after the Purgation is over.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Diſorders never happen to Horſes that are of a <hi>moſt Conſtitution,</hi> lazy, and full of Humours; in which caſe you may adminiſter a <hi>Purgative</hi> Remedy ſafely, and with good Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>This diverſity of Conſtitutions muſt be obſerv'd with a great deal of care and ſagacity.</p>

At Noon and at Night mix a Spoonful with his <hi>Oates,</hi> which muſt be alſo moiſten'd; and in the mean time give him no <hi>Hay,</hi> but only good <hi>Wheat-Straw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If your Horſe be not eas'd by a methodical uſe of this Remedy, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Diſeaſe to be incurable.</p>
                     <p>I thought it needleſs to treat particularly of the <hi>Cough,</hi> becauſe the above-mention'd Remedies cure that Symptom as well as the Diſtemper for which they are preſcrib'd, ſince both proceed from the ſame Cauſe. I am not ignorant that the Cure proceeds more ſucceſsfully when <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> is the only Diſtemper, than when 'tis accompany'd with a <hi>Cough;</hi> and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that either a <hi>Cough</hi> or <hi>heaving in the Flanks,</hi> may be ſingly cur'd without much difficulty, but when they are both joyn'd together, they are not eaſily to be remov'd.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſsful effects of thoſe Powders gave me occaſion to conſider, and endeavour to diſcover the reaſon why <hi>cooling</hi> Remedies are not only uſeleſs, but oftentimes hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Diſeaſe that is accompany'd with ſo many ſigns of <hi>Heat.</hi> And after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Examination of the Nature and Circumſtances of this Diſtemper, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe (as I hinted before) that its original cauſe is almoſt always <hi>Cold,</hi> ſince it uſually proceeds from tough and flegmatick Humours that obſtruct both the Veins and Paſſages of Reſpiration: The adventitious and accidental Heat communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Water by the Fire does not change or deſtroy its natural coldneſs; and the ſame Obſervation may be apply'd to thoſe cold and flegmatick Humours when they are heated by Putrefaction, which occaſions a Fermentation and Ebullition, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with external ſigns of Heat, tho' the Humours are ſtill really Cold. From hence 'tis plain, that tho' a cooling Remedy may allay the Fermentation for ſome time, the Diſeaſe will be afterwards more confirm'd, ſince the Flegm that cauſes it is not only increas'd by the coldneſs of the Medicine, but grows thicker, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more apt to obſtruct the paſſage of the Blood that ought to nouriſh and refreſh the Lungs, which are dry'd and corrupted for want of thoſe uſual and neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. Thus 'tis evident, that the cooling of the Lungs does not remove the cauſe of the Diſtemper, or the obſtruction of the Veſſels, which can never be taken away by cold Remedies; and therefore we are oblig'd to have recourſe to cutting and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Medicines, mixt with <hi>Cordials,</hi> without which they are wholly ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing the truth of this Aſſertion, it may be enquir'd, why <hi>Hay,</hi> which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hot, is ſo hurtful in this caſe, and always encreaſes the <hi>Cough,</hi> and the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the <hi>Flanks?</hi> This difficulty may be eaſily remov'd, by conſidering, that <hi>Hay,</hi> by reaſon of its Heat, augments the Ebullition and Fermentation of the corrupt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and beſides, produces a greater quantity of Blood than what is uſually generated by <hi>Straw,</hi> which being interrupted in its Motion, is putrefy'd, and augments the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Humours. It may be alſo alledg'd, that the Water which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows the Fields and Meadows, covers the <hi>Hay</hi> with a thin and ſharp Slime, almoſt imperceptible to the Eye, that dries the Lungs, and occaſions a <hi>Cough.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Hay</hi> is full of a piercing <hi>Nitre,</hi> that irritates and dries the Lungs; whereas <hi>Straw</hi> is a Drier, and leſs ſubſtantial Nouriſhment, and contains a ſmaller quantity of that <hi>Nitre</hi> which abounds in the ſubſtance of <hi>Hay,</hi> as might be eaſily demonſtrated by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Analyſis</hi> or Examination of its conſtituent Particles.</p>
                     <p>I ſubmit this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to the Judgment of the Candid Reader; but ſince all the Obſervations I have hitherto had occaſion to make, confirm the truth of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I muſt beg leave to retain it, till it be diſprov'd either by Reaſon or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and to conclude, that purely <hi>Cooling</hi> Remedies are rather hurtful than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in this caſe; and that the only effectual Medicines for the Cure of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimper are ſuch as are of a <hi>temperate</hi> Nature, or inclin'd rather to <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Cold.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXVIII. <hi>Of the Cure of</hi> Purſivenſs <hi>with</hi> Eggs.</head>
                     <p>SInce nothing ought to be neglected for the Cure of Horſes that are troubl'd with <hi>Purſiveneſs,</hi> or an Indiſpoſition in their Flanks, you may try the Virtues of the following Remedies, which, tho' very common, are certainly good.</p>
                     <p>Take a Dozen of new-laid <hi>Eggs,</hi> and pour a ſufficient quantity of ſtrong <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> upon 'em, that is, till it riſe an Inch above 'em, leaving 'em to macerate in the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> till the <hi>Shell</hi> be wholly conſum'd, and only the Film or Skin remain that incloſes the Egg. Then having kept your Horſe bridl'd all Night, make him ſwallow all the <hi>Eggs</hi> entire, one after another, giving him ſo much of the <hi>Vinegar</hi> with every <hi>Egg</hi> that the whole may be conſum'd with the <hi>Eggs.</hi> As ſoon as you have given him the laſt <hi>Egg,</hi> cover him well, and walk him gently for the ſpace of two Hours; then unbridle him, and give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to eat no <hi>Hay.</hi> This <hi>Vinegar</hi> loſes its ſharpneſs; and I have ſeen it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Cure of <hi>Quartan Feavers,</hi> with a prodigious Succeſs: And indeed 'tis the <hi>Vinegar</hi> alone that performs the Cure; for the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Egg-Shells</hi> is a true <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi> which having blunted and ſweetn'd the <hi>Acid</hi> of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> takes hold of the <hi>Acid</hi> that cauſes the Diſorders in the <hi>Lungs;</hi> and from this Union there reſults a kind of <hi>Saline</hi> Subſtance agreeable to Nature, whereas before it fretted and prick'd the Lungs by its vehement <hi>Acidity;</hi> for the ſweetn'd <hi>Vinegar</hi> ſerves only for a <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> to convey the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Egg-ſhells,</hi> which quickly leaves its <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and ſucks up the above-mention'd <hi>Acid.</hi> 'Tis plain then that this Remedy is endu'd with more excellent Vertues than the Commonneſs of the Ingredients ſeems to promiſe. The uſe of it may be repeated if need require; and there cannot be a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and leſs chargeable Remedy propos'd.</p>

                           <hi>The</hi> Emetic <hi>or</hi> Angelic Powder <hi>for</hi> Purſiveneſs.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>Angelic Powder</hi> is an excellent Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> call'd by <hi>Chymiſts, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garot, Butter of Antimony, Oleum Glaciale, Emetic Powder,</hi> and the <hi>White Eagle.</hi> I ſhall firſt deſcribe the Method of preparing it, and afterwards conſider its Virtues.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Corroſive Sublimate</hi> and crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> of each one Pound in Powder, mix 'em in a <hi>Glaſs Retort,</hi> ſo large that two third parts of it may remain empty, and place it in an Earthen Pot of ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt the Fire, with a Lay of Aſhes of the thickneſs of two Inches between the bottom of the Pot and that of the Retort. Then fill the Pot with Aſhes till the Retort be almoſt cover'd with 'em. The Beak of the Retort muſt hang down, and the Matter contain'd in it muſt not be above an Inch lower than the beginning of its Neck. Set the Pot in a common Furnace, with a very moderate heat for the ſpace of two hours, after which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Fire, and ſet a Glaſsfull of Water under the Beak of the Retort at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from it. When the Diſtillation begins, the Drops that fall into the Water will turn to a very <hi>White</hi> Powder, if there be no Error committed in the Operation; but if the Fire was too violent at firſt, the Powder will be of a <hi>Grey</hi> Colour, and of no value. If the Powder be white, continue the Diſtillation, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Fire by degrees. Sometimes the Liquor in its Paſſage thro' the Neck of the Retort, congeals, and ſtops the Diſtillation: But if you hold a Cole for ſome time near the Neck, and blow upon it, the <hi>Butter</hi> will melt, and begin again to drop into the Water. Towards the end of the Operation encreaſe the Heat to the higheſt degree; and after the Diſtillation is over, and the Veſſels cold, pour off the Water, and waſh the <hi>White</hi> Powder with freſh Water ſo often, till that which is pour'd off at laſt be wholly inſipid. Then dry the Powder, and preſerve it as one of the beſt Preparations of <hi>Antimony.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that in this Preparation the Acid Spirits of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> that kept the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Form of a <hi>Cryſtalline Salt,</hi> call'd <hi>Corroſive Sublimate,</hi> are ſeparated by the Fire from the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and united to the <hi>Reguline</hi> part of the <hi>Antimony</hi> which they raiſe, and bring along with 'em thro' the Neck of the Retort, in form of a thick Liquor. In the mean time the <hi>Mercury</hi> being freed from thoſe Spirits, joins
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:179659:324"/>it ſelf to the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> and both together are ſublimated in the form of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> to the top of the Retort. To proceed to the Uſe and Virtues of this Preparation.</p>
                        <p>Infuſe half an Ounce of the <hi>Angelical Powder</hi> all Night, ſtirring it two or three times, and in the Morning pour off the clear Wine, without raiſing or ſhaking the Powder at the bottom.</p>
                        <p>Having kept your Horſe two Hours bridl'd, give him the Quart of Wine and the Powder mixt together, and afterwards rinſe the Pot or Horn with half a Pint of Wine, that none of the Remedy may be loſt; then let the Horſe ſtand two Hours bridl'd, and renew the Doſe once every two Days for the ſpace of a Month, till the Cure be perfected.</p>
                        <p>Or you may with leſs trouble give half an Ounce of the Powder every Morning in <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> for fifteen or twenty Days.</p>
                        <p>Whatever Method you think fit to take for adminiſtring the Powder, you muſt always remember to walk your Horſe gently an Hour or two every Day; and even you may make him perform his uſual Service; only you muſt neither ride him too hard, nor make him ſweat too much.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Angelical Powder</hi> may be exhibited very ſafely, and with good Succeſs to Men, for the curing of <hi>Intermitting Feavers.</hi> The Doſe is from two to ſix Grains in any convenient Vehicle, or from two to four Ounces of its Infuſion in Wine. It cures the <hi>Plague</hi> being given in Subſtance, when the Diſeaſe begins to appear, before the Patient's Strength be waſted.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis is an excellent Remedy, and infallibly performs the Cure, if it be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Take half an Ounce of <hi>Gum Tragacanth,</hi> one Dram of <hi>Oriental Saffron</hi> in Powder; infuſe and macerate 'em in a Pint of <hi>Colts-Foot-Water</hi> till it turn to a Gelly: Then take two Pounds of <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> very tranſparent, and of a Citron Colour, beat it to a fine Powder, and mix it in a Mortar by degrees, with the <hi>Gelly</hi> or <hi>Mucilage</hi> of <hi>Gum Tragacanth,</hi> beating and incorporating them with the Peſtle, till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a Maſs that will retain any Figure: Make it up into <hi>Pills</hi> weighing nine Drams each, and having dry'd 'em on the bottom of a Strainer turn'd upwards, keep 'em in a Box. Theſe Pills are incorruptible.</p>
                     <p>Make your Horſe eat one of 'em every Day reduc'd to Powder, and mixt with <hi>moiſtne'd Bran;</hi> and in the mean time you may ride him, and if he forſake his Meat, forbear repeating the Pills till he begin to recover his Appetite. If the heaving in his Flanks be encreas'd inſtead of being abated, 'tis a Sign that the Lungs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably ulcerated, and therefore you muſt entirely lay aſide the uſe of the <hi>Pills,</hi> which in this Caſe wou'd only haſten his Death.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Doſe may be alſo given in a Pint of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> after the Horſe has ſtood bridl'd two Hours. You muſt alſo keep him bridl'd two Hours after, and in the mean time may give him his uſual Allowance of Food, obſerving the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Directions concerning the Heaving or Palpitation of the Flanks, and the loſs of Appetite. If you perceive that he begins to reliſh his Meat again, repeat the Doſe for thirty Days together, obſerving ſtill that if the Palpitation of his Flanks be augmented, the uſe of the Pills muſt be abſolutely diſcontinu'd. But if neither that Symptom be increas'd, nor his Appetite quite loſt, you muſt continue the uſe of the Pills till the whole quantity that was prepar'd be conſum'd; for, as I intimated before, the moſt ſtubborn <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> will yield to this Remedy, if the Diſeaſe be not altogether incurable.</p>
                     <p>At firſt your Horſe perhaps will grow lean, and ſeem to be waſted; but he will afterwards recover his Fleſh, and grow fatter than before. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy muſt never be adminiſter'd to Horſes that have weak and tender Stomachs; for even the greateſt Feeders are wont ſometimes to forſake their Meat on this Occaſion, and will neither taſte Bran nor Oats; in which Caſe you muſt forbear
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:179659:324"/>giving 'em any more Pills till their Appetite be reſtor'd; but many Horſes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the whole Courſe without loſing one Stroak of their Teeth. When the Lungs are ulcerated or putrefi'd, theſe Pills will certainly kill your Horſe, if you continue the uſe of 'em after he has loſt his Appetite; but when the Diſeaſe is incurable, as 'tis in this caſe, the beſt way is to diſpatch him ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> may be alſo prepar'd and exhibited after this manner. Mix half a Pound of it with two Pounds of the Dough of a Loaf, kneading 'em together till the Powder be throughly incorporated with the Dough; then bake the Loaf, and two Days after give the Horſe an eighth part of it, repeating the ſame Doſe every Morning, till he has eaten two Pounds, if he do not loſe his Appetite, and if the heaving in his Flanks be not augmented.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy removes obſtructions, and opens the Paſſages very effectually, cooling the Lungs that were heated for want of Air; and the Natural Temperament of that Part being reſtor'd, the Horſe will recover his Health and Breath without any Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>The Charge of the two Pounds of Pills will not amount to above <hi>Seven Livres,</hi> allowing a moderate Gain to him who prepares 'em; for <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi> is ſold very cheap at <hi>Paris.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>Since <hi>Sulphur</hi> is the <hi>Balſam of the Lungs,</hi> the <hi>Tincture,</hi> containing its pure Subſtance, or <hi>Eſſential Salt,</hi> muſt certainly be a very effectual Remedy in this Caſe; for this Diſtemper being accompany'd with a Redundancy of putrefi'd, tough, and viſcous Humours, requires a powerful cutting Medicine; and 'tis certain that the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Minerals</hi> is more effectual than what can be expected from <hi>Vegetables.</hi> The Remedy is thus prepar'd.</p>
                        <p>Take Powder of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> and <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> of each one Pound, put 'em into a glaz'd Earthen-Pot, capable of containing fifteen Quarts, placing it in a Furnace full of live Coals, and ſtirring uninterruptedly, till the Matter break forth in a blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Flame, which proceeds from the <hi>Sulphur;</hi> then pour in about twelve Quarts of boiling Water, ſtirring the Matter perpetually to prevent its growing hard. After ſix or ſeven Waums, the boiling Water will be ting'd with the Colour of the <hi>Brimſtone;</hi> and after it has boil'd half a quarter of an Hour, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the Tincture, and muſt be pour'd off from the Matter.</p>
                        <p>Take four Pints and a half of this Tincture, and boil it for the ſpace of half a quarter of an Hour in a large Pot, with three handfuls of the Leaves of <hi>Colts-Foot</hi> chopt ſmall, three Roots of <hi>Ellecampane</hi> ſtampt in a Mortar, and three Stalks of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice</hi> beaten; then infuſe them in hot Aſhes all Night, and in the Morning ſet it over the Fire till it grow hot; after which ſtrain out the Liquor, and make your Horſe drink it up, keeping him bridl'd two Hours before and as long after, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him gently for the ſpace of half an Hour. Repeat the Doſe five Days together, after which let him reſt two Days; then give him his Potion five Days, as before, and after two Days of Intermiſſion, finiſh the Courſe by exhibiting the Remedy five Days longer; at the end of which the Horſe will recover his Health if the Diſeaſe be not abſolutely incurable.</p>
                        <p>If during the uſe of this Remedy your Horſe forſake his Meat, you muſt ſuffer him to reſt till he recover his Appetite, and then proceed as before. The <hi>Tincture</hi> may be exhibited alone with very good Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Tincture of Sulphur</hi> is by many eſteem'd a great <hi>Secret;</hi> but whatever it might be call'd before, it cannot pretend a Right to that Title, ſince 'tis now communicated to the Public. You may pour in twelve Pints of freſh Water into the ſame Pot, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as before, make a new Tincture; and even may repeat the Operation three or four times; but 'tis in vain to prepare ſo great a quantity of the Remedy, unleſs you have three or four Horſes to cure; for the Tincture does not continue good above ten or twelve Days, after which the <hi>Sulphur</hi> leaves the Water, and is precipitat edat the bottom of the Veſſel.</p>
                        <p>An excellent <hi>Ptiſan</hi> for <hi>Aſthmatic</hi> Perſons may be made of this <hi>Tincture,</hi> with the Addition of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> and other convenient Druggs.</p>
                        <p>Some Gentlemen will perhaps complain of the tediouſneſs of this Preparation: But if they can find a Remedy to cure their Horſes with leſs trouble, I promiſe them not to be offended at the happineſs of their Invention.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXX. <hi>Of the</hi> Cough.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PUrſiveneſs</hi> is almoſt always attended with a Cough; but the latter of theſe Diſtempers is frequently unaccompany'd with the former.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cough</hi> is an extraordinary Motion of the Parts that ſerve for Reſpiration, by which Nature endeavours to expel the Matter that offends her out of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper uſually proceeds from Flegm lodg'd in the Canals of the <hi>Wind-Pipe,</hi> which is the Paſſage of the Air or Breath. 'Tis the vulgar Opinion that a great quantity of Flegmatick Humours diſtill from the Brain into the Cheſt; but the Lungs of a Horſe are ſo large, and water'd with ſo many Veſſels, that they are ſufficiently able to furniſh Matter for a <hi>Cough,</hi> without borrowing it from any other part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cough</hi> is a ſtruggling of Nature to throw off the Humour that oppreſſes her.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes 'tis the effect of a great Cold, or of the Drineſs of the Paſſages of the Lungs, for want of Moiſture, or of the irritation of that Part by Smoak or Duſt either in the Field, or the Duſt that ſticks to his Hay or Oats; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Cough</hi> is occaſion'd by Drinking either Muddy, or too cold Water.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a Horſe is ſeiz'd with a <hi>Cough,</hi> when, eating too greedily, ſome part of his Food ſlips into the Paſſage of Reſpiration; but in this caſe there is no need of any Remedy. When an old Horſe Coughs, you may know whether he is <hi>Purſive,</hi> by an attentive Conſideration of the Circumſtances of the Symptom; for if the <hi>Cough</hi> be <hi>moiſt,</hi> you have no reaſon to ſuſpect that your Horſe is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded; but if he be <hi>dry,</hi> and often repeated, you muſt obſerve his Flanks carefully, to know certainly whether he be <hi>Purſive.</hi> An old <hi>Cough</hi> is oftentimes more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than a beginning <hi>Purſiveneſs.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Cough</hi> may be occaſion'd by the Relicks of a <hi>Rheum,</hi> or <hi>Foundering in the Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Powder is an excellent Remedy for all ſorts of <hi>Coughs.</hi> But before I proceed to the Deſcription of that Medicine, it will not be improper to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate an Eaſie and Cheap, but very Eſſectual Remedy. Put into each of the Horſe's Ears half a Silver Spoonful of <hi>Oil of Sweet-Almonds,</hi> rubbing the Ear very hardto make it penetrate, continuing after the ſame manner five or ſix Days.</p>
                     <p>By this Method you may cure any <hi>Cold</hi> that proceeds from <hi>Foundering</hi> and <hi>Rheums,</hi> even tho' it be accompany'd with a Running at the Noſe. And 'tis to be obſerv'd, that this Remedy may be adminiſter'd during the uſe of the following Powder, ſince the Operation of the one doth not in the leaſt hinder or retard that of the other.</p>

                           <hi>A</hi> Powder <hi>for a</hi> Cough, <hi>whether old or newly taken.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Take <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Hyſſop, Colt's-Foot, white Mullein, Fenugreek Seed and Juice of Liquorice,</hi> of each ſix Ounces, <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> Roots of <hi>Elecampane</hi> and <hi>Flower de Luce</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> of each five Ounces; <hi>Cardamoms, Gentian, Birthwort long</hi> and <hi>round,</hi> of each three Ounces; Seeds of <hi>Anniſe, Cummin,</hi> and <hi>Fennel,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half; <hi>Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> of each half an Ounce; <hi>Live Sulphur</hi> half a Pound.</p>
                        <p>Beat all the Ingredients apart, and ſearce 'em thro' a fine Hair Sieve; then mix the Powders, and keep 'em hard preſs'd in a cloſe-ty'd Leathern Bag. This Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be kept long, and is ſuperiour in Virtues to moſt other Remedies. 'Tis Methodically compos'd, being a Mixture of Cordials and ſpecific Remedies for the Lungs; for ſince the Cough is occaſion'd by Flegmatic Humours riſing from the Lungs into the Wind-Pipe; the cure of it requires a cutting and attenuating Remedy; and all the Indications are anſwer'd by this Powder.</p>
                        <p>To a large Horſe you may give <hi>two Ounces</hi> of the Powder, in a Quart of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Beer; to thoſe of a middle ſize, an <hi>Ounce and a half;</hi> and only an <hi>Ounce</hi> to ſmall Horſes; let it ſtand in a cold Infuſion in the Beer all Night, and in the Morning make your Horſe drink it luke-warm, keeping him Bridl'd two Hours before, and as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:179659:325"/>long after, and repeating it once a Day for fifteen Days. Thoſe who live in a Country where there is no <hi>Beer,</hi> may, inſtead of it, mix a Pint of <hi>Water</hi> with a Pint of <hi>Wine;</hi> or you may give your Horſe an Ounce every Morning in <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If your Horſe be very fat and fleſhy, and conſequently of a flegmatick Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, you muſt give him the Powder in unmixt <hi>Wine</hi> inſtead of <hi>Beer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since there are ſome Horſes who cannot be eaſily made to ſwallow any thing with a Horn, and the lifting up of his Head and keeping it in that Poſture, may raiſe the <hi>Cough;</hi> and ſince there are ſome Perſons who have not the conveniency of Horns, and others who are not willing to uſe 'em; you may give the Powder in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> beginning with a ſmall quantity, and afterwards augmenting the Doſe to a handful, or two Ounces.</p>
                        <p>Some Horſes at firſt have an Averſion to this Remedy, and therefore you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a ſmall Doſe; but afterwards they became ſo fond of it, that they eat their Bran more heartily when that is mixt with it. And I have even ſeen ſome Horſes eat the Powder without any Mixture, from a Man's Hand.</p>
                        <p>It will not be improper to preſent the Reader with a particular deſcription of all the Ingredients that enter the Compoſition of this excellent Remedy; that ſuch as are Novices in this Art may know the peculiar Virtues of each Simple.</p>
                        <p>If this digreſſion ſeem tedious or uſeleſs to ſome Critical Readers, 'tis preſum'd they will not be offended, ſince they may skip over it without any trouble; and that they will be ſo juſt as to conſider, that the deſcription, which they cenſure, may be perus'd by others with Pleaſure and Advantage.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> is a very uſeful Herb, which is ſown, and proſpers very well in our Gardens. 'Tis moderately hot; it comforts, ſtrengthens, and rejoyces the Heart, corroborates the noble Parts, expels peccant Humours by Sweat, reſiſts Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, aſſwages Pains in the Kidneys, and deſtroys Worms.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>Hyſſop</hi> is a very common Herb, and hot in the ſecond Degree; it attenuates Humours, and being joyn'd to Purgative Medicines, augments their Virtue; tis one of the Specifics for Diſeaſes of the Breaſt, helps Reſpiration, and ſtrengthens the natural Heat.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Coltsfoot,</hi> call'd in <hi>Latin, Tuſſilago,</hi> grows in moiſt, ſandy, and cold Places, and is cold and moiſt in the firſt degree.</p>
                        <p>It cures Inflammations, being externally apply'd, and is a ſpecific Medicine for the Lungs that are dry'd by a preternatural Heat which cauſes a Cough. You will find a large account of its Virtues in <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>White Mullein</hi> grows every where in the Fields, but its commonneſs does not leſſen the excellency of its Virtue.</p>
                        <p>It ſends forth a high Stalk ſet round with yellow Flowers, 'tis cold and moiſt in the ſecond degree, and Cures Fluxes of the Belly, caus'd by Choleric Humours, 'tis an excellent Remedy for the Cough, and allays the heat of the Breaſt; it may be given either Green, or dry'd and reduc'd to Powder, and cures the Cough in Horſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Remedy.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Fenugreek,</hi> call'd by <hi>Hippocrates Epiceras,</hi> is a Seed commonly us'd for the Cure of the Diſeaſes of Horſes, whom it alſo fattens. 'Tis almoſt Temperate; it ſoftens hard Swellings, and expels Wind. <hi>Galen</hi> affirms, that it cures Inflammations that are hard, and not very hot, by Digeſtion; it provokes Sweating and Urine, and makes a Horſe void by the Noſe, the Humours that are lodg'd in the Wind-Pipe.

                        <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Juice of Liquorice</hi> is made of the Roots of that Plant, which at preſent is very common in <hi>France;</hi> 'tis ſomewhat moiſt, but temperate, as to Heat or Cold. 'Tis a ſpecific Remedy for the Breaſt, ſweetens and allays the ſharpneſs of Humours, and helps Nature to expel 'em. And to conclude, it is an excellent Remedy for all Diſeaſes of the Breaſt and Lungs.</p>

                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:179659:326"/>VII. <hi>Juniper</hi> is ſo well known, that it does not ſtand in need of a deſcription. The Berries are indu'd with admirable Virtues, they continue green two Years before they come to Maturity, and are hot in the third Degree. They provoke Urine, are good for the Stomach and Breaſt, reſiſt Poyſon, and expel Wind. The efficacy of theſe Seeds can never be ſufficiently prais'd, and this Simple alone is worth a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Drugs.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Elecampane</hi> grows in ſandy places, the Leaf is of no uſe, and the Root alone is commended by Phyſicians; 'tis hot in the third degree, and of an Aromatic Smell; it provokes Urine very powerfully, reſiſts Poyſon, helps the Cough, is good for the Breaſt, ſtrengthens the Heart, and cures ſpitting of Blood, and the biting of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Creatures.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> grows plentifully in wet places, but that which is brought from <hi>Florence</hi> is moſt effectual; the Root is very odoriferous, hot in the ſecond degree, comforts the Breaſt, and conſumes ſuperfluous and excrementitious Moiſture. It purges watry Humours, if a large quantity of it be given; and its Smell chears and comforts the Brain. It enters the Compoſition of Waters for the Eyes; and it is an excellent internal Medicine for Horſes.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. <hi>Cardamoms</hi> are hot; they chear and comfort the noble Parts, ſtrengthen the natural Heat, expel Wind, and promote the digeſtion of Aliments.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. <hi>Gentian</hi> has its name from <hi>Gentius,</hi> King of <hi>Sclavonia;</hi> the Root is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by all Authors; <hi>Renodaeus</hi> ſays, That 'tis a famous Preſervative againſt the Plague; that it reſiſts Putrefaction, and is an Antidote againſt Poyſon. It comforts the Stomach, kills Worms, and is an excellent Remedy for the biting of Venemous Beaſts.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. The <hi>Birthworts round</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> are dedicated to the Spleen; they diſpel Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, reſiſt Poyſon and Putrefaction, heat and dry up ſuperfluous Moiſture, cloſe and heal Ulcers in the Lungs and other internal Parts, and aſſwage Pains in the Kidneys.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Anniſeed</hi> is one of the four great hot Seeds, and, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is hot and dry in the third degree. 'Tis a powerful Reſolvent, provokes Urine, and expels Wind. <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in the Sixty ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Third Book, ſays, That none of the Seeds that are uſually eaten are more agreeable to the Stomach.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Cummin-ſeed</hi> is hot and dry in the ſecond degree. 'Tis a good Remedy for Griping of the Guts caus'd by Wind, it dries up Milk, and ſtrengthens the Stomach. 'Tis preſcrib'd to correct Purgative Medicines.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. <hi>Fennel</hi> is hot in the ſecond degree; it ſtrengthens the Stomach, diſcuſſes Wind, diſpels Vapours that cauſe the Head-ach, and provokes Urine.</p>

                        <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Brimſtone</hi> is a fat, unctuous, and inflammable Mineral, found in the Bowels of the Earth, either pure or mixt, and ſometimes ſeparated by Art from certain Waters. We call that <hi>Live Brimſtone</hi> which is found in certain Mines, where 'tis Refin'd, and afterwards brought to us in Rolls. 'Tis the <hi>Balſam of the Lungs,</hi> a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Remedy for the Cough, and ſhortneſs of Breath, and purifies the Blood. 'Tis a vulgar Error, that 'tis of a hot Nature, becauſe 'tis eaſily Inflammable.</p>
                        <p>If you examine this Account of the Drugs that enter the Compoſition of the above-mention'd <hi>Powder,</hi> you'll find that they are all agreeable to the Stomach, and that ſome of 'em attenuate thick Humours, and aſſiſt Nature to expel what offends

You may make the Powder more durable by reducing it into the form of an <hi>Electuary.</hi> Boil a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Honey,</hi> (that is, about ſix times the weight of the Powder) to half the thickneſs of a Syrup; then mix the <hi>Powder</hi> with the <hi>Honey</hi> while 'tis moderately hot, without ſetting it again upon the Fire. The Doſe is four Ounces in a Quart of Wine.

                        <p>When the Matter is tough and clammy, it ſticks too faſt; and when 'tis very thick it reſiſts too long; ſo that notwithſtanding Nature's endeavours to expel it, it ſinks and falls down again by its own proper weight, and eſpecially if the Paſſages by which Nature uſually throws it forth, are obſtructed. And therefore if Nature be not aſſiſted by a powerful Remedy, ſuch as this <hi>Powder,</hi> the Diſeaſe will be of long continuance, and at laſt degenerate to <hi>Purſiveneſs.</hi>

                     <p>TAke <hi>Sal-Polychreſt,</hi> and ripe <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> of each one Pound; Roots of <hi>Marſh-Mallows</hi> and <hi>Elecampane,</hi> and Juice of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> of each half a Pound; <hi>Zedoary</hi> and <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Speedwel</hi> dry'd, two Ounces; beat all the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients ſeverally to Powder; then take a ſufficient quantity of the Leaves of <hi>Colts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, White-Mullein,</hi> and <hi>Red Maiden-hair;</hi> boil 'em in Water to four Quarts; ſtrain out the Liquor, and add ten Pounds of <hi>Honey,</hi> boiling 'em to half the thickneſs of a Syrup till two Quarts of the Decoction be conſum'd, and skimming all the while; mix the Powders with the <hi>Honey,</hi> while 'tis half cold, till they be well incorporated, and reduc'd to an Electuary, which muſt be ſet to ferment in a Pot for the ſpace of twenty or thirty Days in Summer; but in cold Weather the Fermentation will require a longer time, and you muſt never uſe the <hi>Electuary</hi> till it be duly Fermented. <hi>Electuaries</hi> and <hi>Confections</hi> are more effectual than <hi>Powders,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that Concentrates, and afterwards exalts the Virtues of the Ingredients. <hi>Avicen</hi> was certainly of this Opinion, for he expreſly affirms, That the <hi>Virtue, or Efficacy of a Medicine is doubl'd by Fermentation.</hi> And beſides, a Remedy may be kept longer in this form, without loſing its Virtue, 'tis more eaſily ſwallow'd, and ſooner wrought upon by the natural Heat in the Stomach. This <hi>Electuary</hi> does very powerfully allay the boiling and preternatural heat of the Stomach; and therefore is an excellent Remedy for fiery and mettleſome Horſes, that pine away after hard Labour or violent Exerciſe, even tho' they be not troubl'd with a Cough: In this caſe you muſt take away their <hi>Oats,</hi> feed 'em with hot <hi>Bran,</hi> and give 'em a Doſe of this <hi>Electuary</hi> once every Day for fifteen or twenty Days; after which they will be in a thriving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>For the ſatisfaction of the curious, I ſhall, in few Words, explain the Nature of <hi>Fermentation.</hi> It derives its Name from <hi>Fermentum</hi> or <hi>Leven,</hi> which is a Contraction of <hi>Fervimentum</hi> from <hi>Fervere,</hi> to <hi>be hot</hi> or to <hi>boil.</hi> It may be thus defin'd, <hi>Fermentation is a Motion, by which, in a Mixture of different Subſtances, thoſe that are moſt ſubtil, agitate and dilate the reſt.</hi> We may ſee Examples of it in Dough, in Wine, and ſeveral other Subſtances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Golden</hi> or <hi>Red Maiden-hair</hi> is one of the Ingredients of the <hi>Syrup,</hi> call'd the <hi>Syrup of the Capillary Herbs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marſh-Mallow</hi> Roots are common at <hi>Paris;</hi> but thoſe who cannot procure 'em may take double the quantity of the dry'd Leaves of <hi>Coltsfoot.</hi> The Doſe is four Ounces for Coach-Horſes, infus'd all Night in three Pints of <hi>Beer,</hi> and drunk luke-warm in the Morning. The Horſe muſt be kept Bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after the Doſe; and in thoſe Countries where there is no <hi>Beer</hi> to be had, the Medicine may be Infus'd in an equal mixture of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>Electuary</hi> is endu'd with all the Virtues of the above-mention'd <hi>Powder;</hi> and beſides, allays the preternatural Heat that uſually accompanies the <hi>Cough.</hi> But if that Diſtemper be occaſion'd by cold, tough, and flegmatic Humours, you muſt not adminiſter ſo cooling a Remedy; and therefore, if after the firſt and ſecond Doſe, you perceive that his Hair begins to ſtare, or that he forſakes his Meat, or Shivers, you muſt give him the <hi>Powder</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Electuary;</hi> but if none of theſe ſigns ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, perſiſt in the uſe of the latter, which will effectually cure the oldeſt and moſt inveterate <hi>Cough.</hi> It happens not unfrequently, that after ſeven or eight Doſes of the <hi>Electuary</hi> the Horſe begins to ſcour as if he had taken a purging Medicine; but you muſt ſtill continue to give him a Doſe once a Day, for it's a ſign that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy operates effectually.</p>
                     <p>You muſt perſiſt in the daily uſe of the <hi>Electuary,</hi> till the <hi>Cough</hi> be perfectly cur'd. 'Tis a ſingular Remedy for thoſe Horſes whoſe Lungs are dry'd up by exceſſive Heat, for it moiſtens the Part, and reſtores it to its natural temper.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the Cure of this Diſtemper may be ſometimes perform'd with leſs Charge and Trouble, I ſhall propoſe ſome other Remedies.</p>

                           <hi>The</hi> Engliſh Pills <hi>for an Old</hi> Cough.</head>
                        <p>An Inveterate <hi>Cough</hi> is one of the moſt ſtubborn Diſtempers incident to Horſes. I have already propos'd ſeveral Remedies, that have been often, but not always attended with Succeſs. The following Pills cur'd Horſes that were troubl'd with this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſix Months, and ſometimes a whole Year, after a fruitleſs Tryal of other Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Flower of Brimſtone</hi> four Ounces, <hi>Anniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beat 'em in a Mortar till they be well incorporated, and mix 'em with four <hi>Eggs</hi> beaten in a Diſh without the Shells, breaking 'em all together in a Mortar till they be reduc'd to a hard Maſs or Paſte. Make Pills weighing ten Drams each, and dry 'em in the Shade on a Hair Sieve turn'd upſide down.</p>
                        <p>When you intend to give your Horſe this Remedy, let him have his uſual Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Meat, and then make him ſwallow a whole Pill in a Pint of Red or White Wine. 'Tis not abſolutely neceſſary to keep him Bridl'd, before you exhibit the Medicine; but 'tis certainly moſt convenient to let him ſtand Bridl'd an Hour before: You muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember to walk him about an Hour after, and then you may ride him; and in the mean time you may either work or ride him, or put him in a Coach; or if not, you muſt keep him Bridl'd two Hours after the Doſe. Continue after the ſame manner to give him a <hi>Pill</hi> once a-day till the <hi>Cough</hi> be wholly cur'd; if the Diſtemper be inveterate the Cure will at leaſt require twenty Doſes.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Pills may be alſo beaten, and mix'd with <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They may be kept very long, and never grow moudly, tho' they are almoſt always moiſt. Tho' your Horſe be not troubl'd with the Cough, to preſerve him from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Inconveniencies, you may give him one of theſe Pills in the Morning before Hunting, or hard Riding.</p>

                        </gap>ſt-Foundering, <hi>and</hi> Foundering <hi>accompany'd with a</hi> Fever.</head>
                     <p>THis Kind of <hi>Foundering</hi> is a preternatural Heat, caus'd by the Fermentation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Guts, and Paſſages of Reſpiration, and is accompany'd with the ſame Signs that denote <hi>Purſiveneſs;</hi> but the Symptoms are more violent: Only there is this difference between theſe two Diſtempers, that there are few Horſes troubl'd with <hi>Purſiveneſs</hi> at the Age of ſix Years, whereas there are many <hi>founder'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is often occaſion'd by riding a Horſe from his Wind, and beyond his Strength. It frequently accompanies the <hi>Melting of the Greaſe,</hi> and ſometimes 'tis oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Application of a violent <hi>Cauſtic,</hi> or <hi>giving the Fire</hi> too roughly, for the Cure of Diſeaſes in the Feet; but in this laſt Caſe the Diſtemper is not dangerous, ſince it may be eaſily Cur'd, by injecting one or two <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Sal Polychreſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes this follows ſome other Diſtempers, when the Humours that fomented 'em are not entirely evacuated, and continue to ſend up ſharp, hot, and malignant Vapours, which irritate the Lungs, and cauſe the extraordinary Motion that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in 'em.</p>
                     <p>Horſes are alſo Subject to this Diſtemper, if they be ſuffer'd to feed on corrupt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender when they are Young as Graſs; frozen in the Meadows, during the Winter, which putrefies in the Body, and breeds a Ferment that occaſions either this, or ſome other dangerous Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>'Tis caus'd by an Obſtruction in the Paſſages of the Lungs, which hinders Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; if this Obſtruction be newly generated, or proceed from hot and ſubtil Matter, it may be eaſily cur'd by the Application of convenient Remedies, if it be not accompany'd with a Fever, in which Caſe 'tis frequently Mortal.</p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:179659:328"/>
                     <p>The Remedies preſcrib'd for the Cure of this Diſtemper ought to be temperate, and rather inclining to Cold than Heat, to allay and ſtop the Fermentation and Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Humors; whereas the Medicines that are preſcrib'd to <hi>purſive</hi> Horſes, muſt be rather Hot than Cold. In the Cure of this Diſtemper we muſt endeavour to allay the Heat that occaſions the Boiling of the Humors, preſcribing all the Medicines in a liquid Form, to dilute and qualifie the Heat of the Ingredients; The <hi>Electuary</hi> preſcrib'd in the preceding <hi>Chapter</hi> for the Cough, is very uſeful in this Caſe, and will certainly perform the Cure if it be adminiſter'd regularly and repeated for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe eat heartily you may cure him of his Diſtemper by giving him every Day from one to two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> mix'd with <hi>moiſten'd Bran;</hi> but if he be naturally ſqueamiſh, or has loſt his Appetite on this Occaſion, 'twill be in vain to attempt this Method.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be Young, and not troubl'd with a Fever, the ſureſt and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Method of Cure is to turn him out to Graſs, when the Herbs begin to ſpring forth, and to leave him in the open Fields under the Dew, during the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> for the young dewy Graſs will ſcowre his Body, and open the Paſſages. <hi>Green Barley</hi> is alſo an excellent Remedy for this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>If this Method be impracticable, by reaſon of the Inconveniency of the Place, or of the Seaſon of the Year, you may obſerve the following Directions.</p>
                     <p>Feed your Horſe with <hi>Wheat-Sheaves</hi> and <hi>Barley,</hi> without allowing him either <hi>Hay</hi> or <hi>Oats;</hi> Let him blood in the Flanks at the New Moon, and the next Day give him a <hi>ſoftening</hi> and <hi>opening Clyſter,</hi> which may be thus prepar'd. Take of the <hi>five opening Roots</hi> beaten, that is, the Roots of <hi>Graſs, Madder, Eringo,</hi> or <hi>Sea-holm, Capers</hi> and <hi>Reſt-Harrow,</hi> of each an Ounce, <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> half an Ounce; boil the Ingredients in five Pints of Water for a Quarter of an Hour: after which add the <hi>five ſoftening Herbs,</hi> namely, <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows, Mercury, Violets,</hi> and <hi>Pellitory of the Wall,</hi> of each a Handful; Boil 'em a quarter of an Hour longer, then ſtrain the Decoction, add half a Pound of <hi>Honey</hi> prepar'd with the Herb <hi>Mercury,</hi> and inject it by way of <hi>Clyſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> in the Evening, repeating the ſame five or ſix Days together.</p>
                     <p>The Day after the adminiſtring of the laſt Clyſter, take <hi>White Mullein</hi> and <hi>Coltsfoot,</hi> of each two Handfuls: Chop 'em, and boil 'em in three Pints of Water for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour, with half an Ounce of <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> in Powder. Aſſoon as you remove the Veſſel from the Fire, add three Handfuls of freſh <hi>Corn-Poppy</hi> Flowers, or half an Ounce of the ſame Flowers dry'd, and covering the Pot, let 'em ſtand in Infuſion, till the Liquor be half cold; then ſtrain, and adding an Ounce of <hi>Juice</hi> of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> give the whole <hi>Decoction</hi> to your Horſe with a Horn, at Night inject the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and next Morning repeat the <hi>Decoction.</hi> Adminiſter the ſame Remedies once every two Days, for the Space of twelve Days; but if, during that time, the Horſe forſake his Meat, you muſt endeavour to reſtore his Appetite, by making him champ on a <hi>Chewing-Ball</hi> two Hours in the Morning, and as long after Dinner, and forbear the Uſe of the Decoction till he begins to eat heartily: but this Inconveniency may be prevented, notwithſtanding the Uſe of the above-mention'd Remedies, by giving him two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Bran every Day, when he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to take the Decoction; which will not only preſerve his Appetite, but promote the Cure.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Remedies prove ineffectual, and the Diſeaſe continue for a conſiderable Time, it may at laſt degenerate to <hi>Purſiveneſs;</hi> to prevent which, if your Horſe be of a phlegmatic Conſtitution, Slow, and Lazy, you may give him the following Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to expel the thick and ſlimy Phlegm; but if he be of a dark Sorrel Colour, or fiery and full of Mettle, this Medicine wou'd make him extremely ſick, tho' a Couple of Clyſters adminiſter'd in the Height of the Sickneſs, might perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ill Effects of it, if you take care in the mean time to walk him frequently. And beſides 'tis to be obſerv'd, that this Remedy muſt not be given to a Horſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, or when 'tis accompany'd with a Fever; for it wou'd purge his Life out of his Body.</p>
                     <p>Take two or three Pounds of <hi>Fat of Bacon</hi> cut into thin Slices, ſteep it in Water till it be freſh, changing the Water five or ſix times once every two Hours; in the mean time take red <hi>Colewort,</hi> not a headed <hi>Cabbage,</hi> and white <hi>Mullein,</hi> of each two large Handfuls, <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> one Handful; Chop 'em ſmall, and beat 'em to a Maſh in a Mortar, with the freſh <hi>Fat of Bacon.</hi> Form this Maſs into <hi>Pills</hi> like Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-Balls, and roll 'em up with Powder of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> that they may not ſtick to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:179659:328"/>your Fingers when you put 'em into the Horſe's Mouth. After the Horſe has taken ſix or ſeven of theſe Pills, give him a little Wine with a Horn, or even after every Pill, if you perceive that your Horſe ſwallows 'em with Difficulty; and after he has taken all the Pills, waſh his Mouth with a Pint of Wine, and afterwards pour it down his Throat; beſides which you muſt allow another Pint to be taken with the Pills. The Horſe muſt ſtand bridl'd four Hours before, and as long after.</p>
                     <p>If this Remedy be attended with Succeſs, to compleat the Cure you muſt begin the former Courſe with the <hi>Decoctions</hi> and <hi>Clyſters;</hi> but if it proves ineffectual, adminiſter the following Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Take the Leaves of <hi>Red Colewort</hi> (not <hi>headed Cabbage,</hi> which is not only uſeleſs but hurtful) and <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> of each three Handfuls, <hi>White Mullein</hi> and <hi>Colt's-foot,</hi> of each three Handfuls; <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> one Handful: Boil 'em half an Hour in two Quarts of Water; then remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and add to the boiling Decoction two Handfuls of freſh <hi>Corn-Poppy</hi> Flowers, or one Handful of 'em dry'd; Cover the Pot immediately, and when 'tis almoſt cold, ſtrain out the Liquor, adding as much <hi>Saffron</hi> as is ſufficient to tinge it with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Colour, with two Ounces of <hi>Liquid Conſerve of Roſes;</hi> and having given your Horſe a Clyſter the Day before, make him drink up this <hi>Decoction,</hi> repeating the ſame Clyſter in the Evening, and continuing after the ſame manner for twelve Days, if your Horſe's Stomach be not diſorder'd; in which Caſe you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Uſe of the Remedies till his Appetite be reſtor'd.</p>
                     <p>After the twelve Days are expir'd, if his Flanks be ſound without any Palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you muſt not overwhelm Nature, with a Heap of Remedies, but allow her Time to compleat the Victory, and utterly to deſtroy her Enemy that is already weaken'd by the Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Since uſually the preternatural Heat which cauſes the Diſtemper, is augmented by the Remedies, and the internal Parts heated and waſted, 'twill be neceſſary to reſtore the Natural, and deſtroy the Preternatural Heat; and to remove the remaining Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, by giving the Horſe every Day an Ounce of <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> in Powder, and two <hi>Nutmegs</hi> grated and mixt with moiſten'd Bran. The Uſe of this Remedy muſt be continu'd for a long time, unleſs the Horſe forſake his Meat; in which Caſe inſtead of <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> 'twill be convenient to give him two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Powder, which procures an Appetite without cooling the Body ſo much as the other.</p>

                     <p>A Young Horſe who had ſo great an Oppreſſion in the Flanks, that he was thought to be <hi>Purſive,</hi> and given over for loſt, was perfectly cur'd by the following Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Moſſie Lung-wort,</hi> chopt ſmall, of each one Handful, <hi>Miſsleto of the Oak</hi> beaten, an Ounce, Roots of <hi>Marſh-Mallows</hi> and <hi>Elecampane</hi> ſtampt in a Mortar, half an Ounce, <hi>Hyſſop</hi> two Handfuls; boil the Ingredients about half an Hour; then preſs out the Liquor, and add half an Ounce of <hi>Juice of Liquorice,</hi> an Ounce of <hi>Liquorice</hi> beaten to Powder, <hi>Anniſeed</hi> and <hi>Fennelſeed</hi> reduc'd to fine Powder, of each half an Ounce, a Scruple of <hi>Saffron,</hi> half a Pound of <hi>Clarify'd Honey,</hi> and a Quart of <hi>White Wine;</hi> Mix and make a <hi>Decoction,</hi> to be given blood-warm to the Horſe at two Doſes, who muſt ſtand bridl'd ſix Hours before, and after you have walk'd him an Hour, muſt be kept bridl'd four Hours longer.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Decoction</hi> muſt be exhibited four Days together, then intermit three Days, and afterwards give him four Doſes more. This Remedy will eaſe him very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and even abſolutely cure him if he be Young. But if you perceive no Benefit by the Uſe of it, you may exhibit the <hi>Purging Medicine</hi> deſcrib'd in the preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> obſerving diligently all the Circumſtances and Directions mention'd there: And afterwards give him the following <hi>Powder,</hi> which may be alſo given ſafely and with good Succeſs, without any preceding Evacuation.</p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:179659:329"/>
                     <p>Take three Pound of <hi>Linſeed,</hi> dry'd in a Furnace, (according to the Method de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in one of the preceding <hi>Chapters,</hi>) <hi>Gentian</hi> three Ounces, <hi>Fenugreek</hi> two Ounces, <hi>Elecampane</hi> an Ounce and a half, <hi>Sage</hi> and <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> of each three Ounces, <hi>Brimſtone</hi> half a Pound; Mix and make a <hi>Powder.</hi> The Doſe is two Spoonfuls, mixt with Bran every Morning, till the whole Powder be taken; and the Horſe muſt ſtand bridl'd an Hour and a half after every Doſe. If the Diſeaſe continue ſtill, give him a Clyſter; for tho' it will not perfect the Cure, it may perhaps give him Eaſe, if it be frequently repeated. And afterwards ſuffer Nature to act, for ſhe will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdue her Enemy, if you aſſiſt her with a well-regulated Diet.</p>
                     <p>The moſt dangerous Kind of theſe Diſtempers is that which is accompany'd with a Fever, which not only torments the Horſe extremely, but makes ſo quick a progreſs, that it will not admit of ſo long a Delay as is requir'd for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the above-mention'd Remedies.</p>

                     <p>The next Day at Four in the Afternoon, adminiſter one of the above-mention'd <hi>Clyſters;</hi> at Six, let your Horſe blood in the two <hi>Plate-Veins</hi> of the Thighs, keeping him bridl'd two Hours after. You may repeat the Doſe of the Remedy two or three times; but not the Bleeding, without Neceſſity. In the mean time, the Horſe muſt eat little <hi>Hay;</hi> you muſt frequently waſh his Mouth, with <hi>Verjuice, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> and oftentimes inject one of the above-mention'd <hi>Clyſters.</hi> Since I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerv'd, that the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ask an exceſſive Rate for this Remedy, I thought fit to advertiſe thoſe who may have Occaſion to uſe it, that the higheſt Price of it does not amount to above<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>This Remedy ought to be highly eſteem'd by thoſe who are Maſters of good Horſes; for by the Uſe of it in leſs than a Month, I cur'd Four Horſes of Value, after they were paſt Hope of Recovery.</p>
                     <p>For your Horſes Ordinary Drink. You may diſſolve in a Pailful of Water the Remedy for Fevers, conſiſting of <hi>Salt of Tartar, Sal Armoniac, &amp;c.</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXXXVI. If that cannot be procur'd, you may infuſe in a Pailful of Water, the <hi>Dough</hi> of a Peny-Loaf ready to be put into the Oven, which makes the Water white, cools the Body of the Horſe, and affords ſome Nouriſhment; and is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better than Flower, which is commonly us'd on this Occaſion.</p>

                     <p>This is an excellent Remedy for ſimple Fevers, and almoſt for all Horſes that are troubl'd with a violent beating in the Flanks, proceeding from a hot Cauſe; and I have even given it with good Succeſs to <hi>Morfounded</hi> Horſes, when the Diſeaſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with a beating in the Flanks; for tho' in this caſe hot Remedies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to ſtrengthen Nature, and enable her to expel that which offends her; yet ſince the Fever is augmented by the heat of the Medicins, we muſt find out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a good Remedy that ſtrengthens without much Heat, which is the peculiar Character of the above-mention'd <hi>Julep,</hi> or mixture of Waters.</p>
                     <p>When the Fever is violent, the Sick Horſe either does not lie down at all, or if he does, ſtarts up again immediately, by reaſon of the difficulty of Breathing, that oppreſſes him when he lies; and therefore, if in this caſe your Horſe lie down, and remain long in that Poſture, you may conclude him to be in a hopeful Condition; nor muſt you reckon it a bad ſign, tho' he complain more when he lies than when he ſtands, for even the ſoundeſt Horſes are wont to complain when they are in that Poſture. This is an important remark in the caſe of all Horſes that are extreamly Sick, and a diligent obſervance of it, will enable you to make a better Judgment of the Nature of the Diſtemper.</p>

Keep him Bridl'd three Hours before and two Hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at Night give him the following <hi>Clyſter.</hi> Take <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> an Ounce and a half, <hi>Pulp of Coloquintida</hi> without the Seeds, half an Ounce; boil 'em in five Pints of <hi>Beer</hi> half a quarter of an Hour, and in the ſtrain'd Liquor diſſolve a quarter of a Pound of good <hi>Populeum;</hi> make a <hi>Clyſter</hi> to be injected Lukewarm. If this Remedy prove ineffectual, you may conclude that your Horſe's Life is in danger; but if you perceive any ſigns of Amendment, you muſt frequently repeat the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> which will very much promote the Cure.</p>
                        <p>I have ſometimes given with Succeſs a Doſe of <hi>Stinking Pills</hi> to Horſes troubl'd with this Diſtemper; for tho' that Medicine ſeems at firſt to encreaſe the beating in the Flanks, it quiets all thoſe diſorders afterwards; tho' I muſt confeſs the ſame Remedy has diſappointed me at other times.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXXV. Crocus Metallorum.</head>
                     <p>TAke the beſt <hi>Crude Antimony,</hi> or that which is fulleſt of Points, and <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> of each an equal quantity; beat 'em ſeverally to Powder, and mix 'em in a Crucible. Then ſet 'em on Fire with a Match or live Cole, and as ſoon as the Flame is extinguiſh'd, and the Matter cold, you will find the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> under the <hi>Scoriae;</hi> which are alſo of good uſe in certain Caſes.</p>
                     <p>Separate the <hi>Liver</hi> and reduce it to a very fine Powder; then throw it into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and beat again in the ſame Mortar that which the Water cannot diſſolve, continuing after the ſame manner till the whole Matter be reduc'd to an impalpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Powder; then ſuffer the Water to ſettle, and you will find at the bottom a Liver-Colour'd Powder, which you muſt continue to waſh by pouring on freſh Water, till the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Nitre</hi> that is not conſum'd by the Flame be wholly ſeparated from the Powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or the Infuſion of it in Wine, is given inwardly to Men; but 'tis not proper for Horſes, and therefore inſtead of it uſe <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> which differs in ſome reſpects from <hi>Crocus,</hi> and is thus prepar'd.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Liver of Antimony.</head>
                        <p>Take choice <hi>Crude Antimony</hi> groſly beaten, ſix Pounds; <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> of the ſecond So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution four Pounds and a half, for that which is white and refin'd is too violent; beat the <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> very ſmall, and mix it with the <hi>Antimony</hi> in an Iron-Pot or Braſs-Mortar, two third Parts remaining empty; then kindle the Matter with a light Match or piece of Charcoal, and as ſoon as it takes Fire remove to a convenient diſtance from the Pot, to avoid the Fumes of the <hi>Antimony:</hi> when the Matter is cold, turn up the Mortar, for the <hi>Liver</hi> lies at the bottom, under the remaining part of the <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> which is join'd with the Impurities of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Scoriae.</hi> You may eaſily ſeparate 'em, for the <hi>Liver</hi> ſhines like Glaſs, and is of a very dark brown Colour; if not, 'tis a ſign that you have committed ſome error in the Operation; and eſpecially, if it be of a pale yellowiſh Colour, you may conclude that 'tis burnt and not fit for Horſes. You muſt not waſh the <hi>Liver of Antimony;</hi> for they who take that Method, deprive it of a conſiderable part of its Virtues. The <hi>Scoriae</hi> ſerve for other uſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for <hi>Clyſters;</hi> and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that in whatſoever part of this Book <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> is preſcrib'd as an Ingredient for a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> you may ſubſtitute a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Scoriae,</hi> which will produce a very good, and perhaps a better effect; for they are a true <hi>Polychreſt,</hi> compos'd of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Nitre;</hi> and the Virtue of the <hi>Antimony</hi> with which they are impregnated, makes 'em operate more effectually than common <hi>Polychreſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may give your Horſe once a Day, for the ſpace of a Month, two Ounces of the <hi>Liver</hi> reduc'd to fine Powder, and mixt with <hi>Oats</hi> or <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi> It reſtores loſt Appetite, kills Worms, promotes the Cure of Wounds, of the <hi>Farcin</hi> and <hi>Mange,</hi> purifies the Blood, by removing Obſtructions, and opening the Paſſages, fattens tyr'd and waſted Horſes; helps the Cough, and ſhortneſs of Breath.</p>
                        <p>The effect of this Remedy does not appear externally, for it acts by inſenſible Tranſpiration, cooling and refreſhing the inward Parts without evacuation, and if there be any univerſal Medicine for Horſes, it muſt certainly lurk in this Remedy; for Experience daily makes new diſcoveries of its Virtues, and 'tis generally good for all Diſtempers that do not require hot Remedies.</p>
                        <p>To convince you that it acts by <hi>inſenſible Tranſpiration,</hi> I ſhall only deſire you to be preſent while your Horſe is Curry'd; for when he begins to take this Medicine, you will perceive the Impurity and Filth that ſticks to his Skin to be wonderfully encreas'd; for the <hi>Antimony</hi> purifying the Blood, expels thro' the Pores of the Skin the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third Concoction, or thoſe fuliginous Vapours that corrupt the Blood.</p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:179659:330"/>
                        <p>Not long ago a Perſon who had given <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> to his Horſes, ask'd me, what <hi>Crude Antimony</hi> was before it was put into any other form; and told me, that I ought to have ſo much regard to the Reader's ſatisfaction, as not to leave him unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of that Remedy. <hi>Antimony</hi> is a Mineral Body, approaching to a Metallic Matter; it is of a black Collom, ſomewhat bluiſh, with large Points like Needles, ſhining like poliſh'd Tin; 'tis compos'd of two kinds of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> one very pure and fixt, and its Nature is not very much different from that of <hi>Gold;</hi> the other is inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable like common <hi>Sulphur.</hi> Beſides, it contains a great deal of <hi>Mercury,</hi> more ſolid and better concocted than the Metal that commonly bears that Name, with a little thick and ſalt <hi>Earth.</hi> The beſt <hi>Antimony</hi> is brought from <hi>Hungary;</hi> 'tis alſo brought from <hi>Germany</hi> and ſeveral other Places; 'tis now very cheap and common, ſince ſeveral excellent Mines of it have been diſcover'd in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In moſt of its Preparations it aſſumes the Figure of the <hi>Salts</hi> with which 'tis joyn'd; and almoſt all the moſt celebrated Powders that are made of it, are only diſguis'd Particles of the <hi>Regulus of Antimony,</hi> that act diverſly according to the Nature of the <hi>Salts</hi> or <hi>Corroſive Spirits</hi> with which they are entangl'd. I might confirm this Aſſertion, by obſerving, that many of the Preparations of <hi>Antimony</hi> may be reduc'd to a <hi>Regulus</hi> with <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Borax,</hi> which diſintangle 'em by the aſſiſtance of the Fire, and give 'em an opportunity to re-aſſume the form of a <hi>Regulus.</hi> The deſign of theſe various Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations is to open the Body of the <hi>Regulus,</hi> that being reduc'd to ſmaller Atoms, it may operate more effectually, and in a leſs quantity.</p>
                        <p>To make <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> you muſt Infuſe two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> reduc'd to fine Powder in three Pints of White-Wine, and after it has ſtood twenty four Hours in a cold Infuſion, you may pour off a Quart, and add another in its place, repeating the abſtraction of the old, and addition of freſh Wine five or ſix times. This Remedy is generally magnify'd by all Chymiſts; but ſince it was never given to Horſes till the uſe of it was introduc'd by me, 'tis not ſo well known as it ought to be. <hi>Rulandus</hi>'s <hi>Aqua-Benedicta</hi> is made of the <hi>Crocus,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Authors</hi> have treated particularly of its Virtues; among the reſt <hi>Schroder, Crollius,</hi> and <hi>Quercetan,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſeveral curious Obſervations and Experiments concerning <hi>Crocus Metallorum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ſatisfie the Scruples of thoſe who are not acquainted with the Operation of <hi>Antimony</hi> on the Bodies of Horſes, and that none may be afraid to adminiſter ſo excellent a Remedy, I ſhall once more aſſure 'em, that in what manner or form ſoever it is given to Horſes it never purges 'em, and that even the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> which is drawn from the <hi>Scoriae</hi> that remain after the Preparation of the <hi>Regulus,</hi> and is the moſt violent <hi>Emetic</hi> that is extracted from that Mineral, does not in the leaſt purge a Horſe. Before I was acquainted with the effects of prepar'd <hi>Antimony,</hi> having ſeen the <hi>perpetual Pills</hi> of <hi>Regulus of Antimony</hi> for Men, one of which may ſerve to purge a whole Army, being ſwallow'd by all the Soldiers one after another, as every Phyſician knows and will acknowledge: I caus'd two Pills of the <hi>Regulus</hi> to be made, of the bigneſs of a large Nut, and gave 'em to a Horſe with a deſign to purge him, but he voided 'em without any alteration, two Days and a half after he had taken 'em, without the leaſt ſign of Purgation, or change in the thickneſs or conſiſtency of his Dung. I gave the ſame Pills to another Horſe, who two Days after voided one, and the other remain'd in his Body the ſeven laſt Years of his Life, and was found by the Man that flay'd him in one of the folds of his Guts, who imagining that it was a <hi>Muſquet-Bullet,</hi> came to ſhew it me, wondring that ſo large a Bullet did not kill the Horſe when he receiv'd the Shot. Theſe two Experiments may ſerve to convince the Reader, that the <hi>Regulus of Antimony</hi> does not exert its Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative force on the Body of a Horſe.</p>
                        <p>Prepar'd <hi>Antimony</hi> may be ſafely given in the above-mention'd, and ſeveral other caſes. Its principal effect is to purifie the whole Maſs of the Blood by inſenſible Tranſpiration; and the frequent uſe of it conſumes the ſuperfluous watry Humours, which being Infected with Putrefaction, tranſmit malignant Vapours to the Brain, breed a ſlimy Matter that ſtops and obſtructs the ſmall Branches of the Veins, and mixing with the Blood corrupts the whole Maſs of it, and makes it unfit for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> does very powerfully open the Obſtructions of the Veins and Arteries, and ſo deſtroys the fomenting cauſe of moſt Diſtempers; and beſides, 'tis endu'd with this admirable quality, that it acts by way of <hi>Irradiation,</hi> an unbounded Virtue, peculiar to this Mineral, reduc'd to Medicines by a due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:179659:331"/>
                        <p>The ſame Remedy is both an excellent <hi>Preſervative</hi> from all Diſtempers, if it be given to a Horſe from time to time, and <hi>Cures</hi> thoſe that are actually troubl'd with Diſeaſes, excepting ſuch as require hot Remedies, as the <hi>Strangles, Glanders,</hi> and <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Noſe.</hi> I am extreamly ſurpriz'd not to find the leaſt mention of ſo noble a Remedy in the Works of ſo many Learned and Judicious Authors who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Maladies of Horſes.</p>
                        <p>It cools and refreſhes the Body, and thoſe who uſe it will have the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of believing, on moſt certain and reaſonable Grounds, that it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ill effect. I know the ancient Phyſicians who were generally Enemies to <hi>Antimony,</hi> endeavour'd to deſtroy the credit of that Remedy, by affirming that 'tis full of <hi>Arſenical Spirits</hi> that waſte and corrode the Internal Parts, and are uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fatal Conſequences, tho' it ſeems at firſt to be adminiſter'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Succeſs; but I muſt beg leave of thoſe Gentlemen to tell 'em, that at leaſt with reſpect to Horſes, thoſe <hi>Arſenical Spirits</hi> are only lodg'd in their <hi>Brains,</hi> for I have made ſeveral Horſes eat four or five Pounds of this Remedy without intermiſſion, and ſometimes four or five Ounces every Day, ſo that if there had been any <hi>Corroſive Spirits</hi> in the <hi>Antimony,</hi> the Stomach and Inteſtines of theſe Animals would have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been bor'd like Sieves: Whereas on the contrary the Horſes that devour'd ſo large a quantity of <hi>Antimony</hi> recover'd daily, grew brisk and luſty; and even ſome that were <hi>Hide-bound</hi> and waſted, were quickly fatten'd by the uſe of this Powder, which contains no malignant Particles, nor even produces any ill effect on the Body of a Horſe, as I might eaſily demonſtrate by the teſtimony of a thouſand Perſons that have us'd it. After ſo many Experiments I am ſo fully perſwaded of the harmleſneſs of this Remedy that I recommend it to all my Friends; and as for the <hi>Arſenical Spirits</hi> I'm no more afraid of 'em than of the <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Hobgoblins</hi> with which Children are uſually ſcar'd. If your Horſe's Diſtemper requires hot Remedies, you muſt abſtain from the uſe of <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> becauſe it cools the Body. And 'tis alſo to be obſerv'd, that when your Horſe begins to eat it, eſpecially during the firſt eight or ten Days, you muſt neither Gallop, Work, nor even Ride him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; for by the uſe of this Remedy the Blood is put into a kind of univerſal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition; and therefore if the Horſe be fatigu'd or over-ridden, while the Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be ſo briskly mov'd, he will eaſily become <hi>Founder'd,</hi> tho' he might have eſcap'd that Inconveniency, if he had not eaten the <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> ſince the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and eſpecially the Blood, wou'd not have been ſo violently agitated. In the mean time moderate Exerciſe is not only convenient but neceſſary, for it obliges Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to expel by the Pores thoſe Vapours, call'd <hi>Fuliginous Steams,</hi> that infect the Blood; but during the firſt eight or ten Days, vehement Exerciſe is extreamly hurtful, and you muſt always remember when your Horſe ſweats, to wipe and dry him very carefully, and to prevent his growing ſuddenly Cold; tho' after the firſt Ebullition of the Blood is over, you need not confine your ſelf to ſo ſtrict an obſervance of thoſe Cautions.</p>

                     <p>HOrſes are uſually reduc'd to a languiſhing condition by violent Exerciſe, and fatiguing Marches, eſpecially in an Army, and can hardly ever after recover their wonted Health and Vigour; for ſometimes they have good Forage, whereas at other times they are obliged to eat <hi>Rye, Millet,</hi> unwholſome Herbs and rotten Hay; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have abundance of Provender, and at other times very little or none at all; and beſides, they are ſometimes forc'd to drink corrupt Water at unſeaſonable times, not to mention the irregularity and hardneſs of their Marches; ſo that if a Horſe be not of a very ſtrong Conſtitution, and well Limb'd, 'tis almoſt impoſſible for him to undergo ſo many Fatigues.</p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:179659:331"/>
                     <p>'Tis not an eaſie Task on ſuch occaſions to direct the Intentions of the Cure to any particular Diſtemper; but you can hardly fail of ſucceſs, if you take care to exhibit and apply ſuch Remedies as are proper to ſtrengthen the internal, and refreſh the external parts of the Body, to expel and conſume the peccant Humours that are daily gather'd, either by <hi>Bleeding,</hi> or univerſal <hi>Purgations;</hi> and if you diſcover any particular Diſtemper, you muſt have recourſe to the ſpecific Remedies that are peculiarly appropriated to your Horſe's preſent Condition.</p>
                     <p>The Signs to know a Horſe that has been ill us'd in the Camp, are theſe; When he Breathes, there appears a ſort of Canal ſtretching along his Belly like a Rope or Cord; his Hair ſtares, and is diſcolour'd, his Dung is dry, black, and ſometimes full of Worms, and his Eyes are heavy; he never thrives, tho' he feeds heartily, when you walk him he ſeems ſullen and complains, and ſhews none of that briskneſs or livelineſs, which is uſually the effect of repoſe.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Signs appear in a tir'd Horſe, after his return from the Army, or from a long Journey, you muſt in the firſt place let him Blood in the Neck-Veins, and afterwards proceed to exhibit ſome digeſtive Powder that promotes the Concoction of Aliments, and prepares the ſuperfluous Humours, in order to their more eaſie and effectual Evacuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> produces the effect of a <hi>Digeſtive Powder,</hi> if two Ounces of it be given once a Day with <hi>moiſten'd Bran:</hi> But if your Horſe has an averſion to <hi>Bran,</hi> you may give him the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony</hi> in <hi>Wine,</hi> according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXXIX. which will operate more effectually than any other Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and quickly reſtore the Horſe to his wonted Strength and Vigour.

As ſoon as the Flame diſappears, ſtir the Matter at the bottom of the Crucible, and caſt in the reſt of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> by Spoonfuls, as before, ſtirring the Matter at the bottom with ſome Iron Inſtrument, that the Fire may penetrate it more effectually; after you have caſt in three or four Spoonfuls, you muſt ſtir the Matter for ſome time, and continue after the ſame manner till all the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> be caſt into the Crucible; then cover it, and lay Coals on the top, and every where round the ſides, ſuffering it to cool of it ſelf. After 'tis cold beat the Matter to Powder, which, if the Operation be rightly perform'd, and the <hi>Nitre</hi> very fine, will be of a pale <hi>Roſe-Colour,</hi> if not, 'twill be <hi>white</hi> as Snow, and fit for uſe, or <hi>grayiſh</hi> and of no value. Four Pounds of Matter will yield a Pound and half of <hi>Sal-Polychreſt,</hi> which is endu'd with qualities oppoſite to thoſe of ordinary <hi>Sulphur,</hi> for it diſſolves in Water, and grows red in the Fire without conſuming. That which reſembles the colour of a <hi>Roſe</hi> is better than the <hi>white;</hi> tho' I muſt confeſs, that ſuppoſing the Operation to be perform'd with the utmoſt exactneſs, and the <hi>Nitre</hi> to be pure and fine, 'tis not always poſſible to produce that <hi>Roſie Colour,</hi> which in ſome meaſure ſeems to be the effect of Chance.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy cools very effectually, and even ſometimes too powerfully; for ſuch Medicines as are moderately cold are moſt proper for Horſes; and for this reaſon 'tis ſeldom or never given alone, and not often internally. You may correct it with <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> or <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> mixing an Ounce of the Powder, with half an Ounce of the Berries, or ſcrapings of <hi>Nutmeg</hi> in moiſten'd Bran; or if the Horſe will not eat it ſo, you may Infuſe it all Night in a Quart of Wine, and in the Morning heat it luke-warm, and make the Horſe drink it up faſting. You may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the firſt or ſecond Doſe, whether your Horſe's Condition requires a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remedy; for if not, he will loſe his Appetite, and his Hair will briſtle and ſtare, eſpecially in the Flanks; and therefore if theſe ſigns appear, you may conclude, that his Body ought rather to be heated with good <hi>Cordial Powders,</hi> than cool'd with <hi>Sal-Polychreſt.</hi> 'Tis the general Opinion that ſick Horſes ought to be treated as Men, who for the moſt part ſtand in need of cooling Medicines, by reaſon of their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inordinate Deſires, which together with their Intemperance, heat the Blood, and conſequently all the Parts of the Body; but Horſes are free from thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Motions and Vexations that diſquiet Men, ſo that their Blood and Humours are not ſo apt to be heated and inflam'd, and conſequently they ſtand rarely in need of cooling Remedies.</p>
                     <p>You may give from one to two Ounces of <hi>Polychreſt</hi> in a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> to appeaſe the beating of the Flanks, and allay the heat of the Inteſtines; for tho' his Dung be dry and bak'd, three or four of theſe <hi>Clyſters</hi> will reduce it to its natural Temperament and Conſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>This is alſo an excellent Remedy for Men, and might be us'd with very good Succeſs by thoſe who are troubl'd with a ſtoppage in their Lungs, and ſpitting of Blood, or to prevent the ill conſequences of a fall from a high place; but beſides the above-mention'd Directions, it muſt be diſſolv'd in Water, filter'd, boil'd till there appears a Film on the top, put into a Wooden Veſſel, and ſet to Cryſtallize in a Cellar. The Cryſtals are of a ſquare Figure, almoſt like that of common Salt, and muſt be kept in a Glaſs cloſe ſtopt for Men; but the firſt Preparation is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Horſes. 'Tis alſo exhibited in Obſtructions of the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Meſentery;</hi> it looſens tough Matter, and purges gently by Stool: The Doſe is from two to four Drams, and it may be ſucceſsfully given after this manner. Take four Drams of <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> in Cryſtals, one ſtalk of <hi>Liquorice</hi> beaten, Flowers of <hi>double Damask Roſes,</hi> either freſh or dry, two Pugils; or inſtead of theſe, <hi>Violet Flowers,</hi> put 'em into an Earthen Pot with a Quart of boiling Water, and let 'em ſtand in Infuſion all Night. In the Morning drink a large Glaſs-full of the Water, and an Hour after another; for it purges very gently, and without heating the Body; or you may make a Diet-Drink to be us'd even at Meals, by diſſolving half an Ounce of this Salt in two Quarts of Water. I am ſo ſenſible of the excellency of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and of its uſefulneſs to thoſe who live in the Country, at a diſtance from Phyſicians, that I cou'd not forbear inſerting the Preparation of it for humane Bodies, contrary to my reſolution, not to invade the Province of <hi>Phyſicians;</hi> and

Cleanſe and ſtamp the Roots, and put a Handful of each Kind into a Kettle, with <hi>Lees of Wine;</hi> after they have boil'd for a conſiderable time, add a convenient Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>Herbs,</hi> and boil 'em three Hours longer: Then take a Handful of the Herbs and Roots as hot as you can endure to hold 'em in your Hand, and rub the whole Body of your Horſe, till it be well moiſten'd; and immediately after rub his Flanks, Belly, Throat, and all the reſt of his Body with <hi>Ointment of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier,</hi> chafing it in with your Hands to make it ſink: Then dip an old Table-Cloth, or any other worn and us'd Piece of Cloth, in the hot Lees that remain in the Kettle, and lay it double on the Horſe's Body, covering him entirely with it; and over that lay one or two Quilts, binding 'em on with a Surcingle or two, if there be occaſion; or you may few the Ends of the Quilts together. Twenty four Hours after unbind the Quilts and Cloth, and renew the Fomentation, repeating it twice afterwards, as before.</p>
                     <p>The main Scope and Intention of theſe <hi>Fomentations,</hi> is to draw the Spirits and Nouriſhment to the dry Skin, that it may be looſen'd from the Horſe's Body.</p>
                     <p>After the Fomentations, you muſt keep your Horſe cloſe cover'd for ſome Days, to prevent his catching of Cold, by reaſon of the Tenderneſs of his Skin; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give him the laſt <hi>Clyſter</hi> preſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXXIII.

                        <p>You muſt always obſerve to keep your Horſe bridl'd five Hours before the taking of a Purge, and at leaſt four Hours after; and aſſoon as he has taken it, you muſt walk him for the ſpace of half an Hour.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXXIX. <hi>The</hi> Golden Sulphur <hi>of</hi> Antimony.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GLauber</hi> has communicated the Preparation of this Medicine in ſeveral Parts of his Writings; but by collecting and comparing together theſe ſcatter'd Shreds, 'tis plain that his true Method is as follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of crude <hi>Antimony</hi> two Pounds, <hi>Tartar</hi> a Pound, fine <hi>Nitre</hi> half a Pound; make a <hi>Regulus</hi> according to Art, and reſerve the <hi>Scoriae,</hi> which are only uſeful for this Preparation; tho' the <hi>Regulus</hi> may ſerve for ſeveral other Uſes in Phyſic. Boil the <hi>Scoriae</hi> in a ſufficient quantity of Water, ſtirring it from time to time, till part of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> be diſſolv'd; Let the Solution ſtand till it ſettle, then pour off the clear Liquor, or, if you pleaſe, filtrate it thro' brown Paper, and throw away the groſs Subſtance that remains upon the Paper, reſerving the ſtrain'd Solution. At the ſame time, boil a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Tartar</hi> in Water, ſtirring it till it be diſſolv'd, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conſiderable time; then put the firſt Water into an Earthen Pot, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees pour the Solution of <hi>Tartar</hi> upon it, after which you will immediately feel a ſtrong and ſtinking Smell, and the mixt Liquors will precipitate, or let fall a brown Powder to the bottom. This is the <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> which muſt be dry'd on brown Paper, and preſerv'd for Uſe. The Doſe is from half an Ounce to an Ounce, mixt with a double quantity of fine white Flower; infuſe it all Night in a Quart of Wine, and give it to your Horſe every Morning, keeping him bridl'd two Hours before, and three Hours after; and repeating the Doſe once a-day for the ſpace of fifteen or twenty Days, which without any other Remedy will reſtore him to his perfect Health, by conſuming and diſpelling the Humours that hinder him from growing fat. Since the Flanks of lean and tyr'd Horſes are uſually lank and heated, this Remedy will alſo remove that Inconvenience, tho' they eat a great deal of <hi>Hay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They who are not skill'd in the Operations of Art, will perhaps be offended at the ſeeming Difficulty of this Preparation, tho' it be really eaſie, and very cheap; but they may free themſelves of that Trouble, by having recourſe to any <hi>Apothecary</hi> that has the leaſt Skill in <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> I order'd the <hi>Golden Sulphur</hi> to be mixt with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to keep it from falling to the bottom, that the Horſe may ſwallow it more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy does not purge Horſes; <hi>Glauber</hi> calls it his <hi>Univerſal Medicine,</hi> and gives us a long Catalogue of ſucceſsful Experiments, to demonſtrate its Uſefulneſs in all Diſeaſes incident to Men. It imitates the other Preparations of <hi>Antimony</hi> in its Operation on the Body of a Horſe, which is perform'd by inſenſible Tranſpiration: It purifies the Blood, looſens the Skin from the Bones, cools the internal Parts, expels watry Humours, opens and ſcowres the Paſſages, reſiſts Putrefaction, and increaſes the Natural Heat.</p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:179659:333"/>
                     <p>Beſides its Uſefulneſs for the Recovery of lean and tyr'd Horſes, it contributes to the Cure of the <hi>Farcin, Scab, Cough, Peeling of the Head,</hi> and a beginning <hi>Purſiveneſs:</hi> And in a Word, it may be ſaid, that there are few Remedies for Horſes of equal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Efficacy to this: And beſides 'tis of excellent Uſe in the Diſtempers of Humane Bodies.</p>
                     <p>It cools and purifies the Blood, and allays the Heat of the Intrails, without the leaſt Prejudice to the Horſe; whereas other cooling Remedies are uſually more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than profitable: For they make the Horſe lean and meager, ſpoil his Appetite, make his Hair ſtare, and confirm the Obſtructions of the inward Parts, eſpecially when they are unſeaſonably and prepoſterouſly exhibited; but this admirable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is not attended with any of thoſe Inconveniencies.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis Method has all the Advantages that can be deſir'd; for 'tis Eaſie, Cheap, and very Effectual.</p>
                     <p>After you have let your Horſe blood, put half a Buſhel of coarſe <hi>Barley-Meal</hi> into a Pailful of Water, ſtirring it about for a conſiderable Space of Time; then let it ſtand till it fall to the bottom, and pour out the Water into another Pail, for the Horſe's ordinary and only Drink; and make him eat the Meal that remains at the bottom of the Pail, thrice every Day, Morning, Noon, and Night. If he refuſe or ſeem unwilling to eat the Meal alone, mix it with a little Bran: The next Day leſſen the Quantity of the Bran, and at laſt give him none at all, for it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:179659:334"/>ſerves only to accuſtom him to eat of the Meal; or inſtead of the Bran you may mix a ſmall quantity of <hi>Oats</hi> with the Meal, and diminiſh it by degrees as before. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Barley</hi> muſt be ground every day as you uſe it; for it quickly grows ſowre, after which the Horſe will not taſte it.</p>
                     <p>There are few Horſes that may not be fatten'd by keeping 'em to this Dyet for the ſpace of twenty Days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barley,</hi> ground after this manner, purges the Horſe, and cools his inward Parts: But the greateſt Efficacy lies in the Water that is impregnated with the moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and uſeful Subſtance of the Meal. When you perceive your Horſe to thrive and grow luſty, you muſt take him off from this Dyet by degrees, giving him at firſt <hi>Oats</hi> once and <hi>Barley-Meal</hi> twice a-day; then <hi>Oats</hi> twice, and the <hi>Meal</hi> once, till your Horſe be perfectly recover'd. In the mean time you may give him <hi>Hay,</hi> and good <hi>Straw</hi> alſo if you pleaſe; but you muſt not ride him, only walk him ſoftly about half an Hour in the middle of the Day.</p>
                     <p>After your Horſe has eaten <hi>Barley-Meal</hi> eight Days, give him the following <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> if you find he ſtands in need of it. Take of the fineſt <hi>Aloes</hi> an Ounce and a half, <hi>Agaric,</hi> and Roots of <hi>Flower de Luce of Florence,</hi> of each an Ounce; beat all three to Powder, and mix 'em with a Quart of Milk warm as it comes from the Cow, if you can procure it, keeping your Horſe bridl'd ſix Hours before, and four Hours after the taking of it, without diſcontinuing his uſual Diet. This <hi>Purgation</hi> will operate effectually, ſince the Humours are already prepar'd, and the Body moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd and cool'd: And therefore the Medicine will not occaſion any Diſorder, or Heat, and the Horſe will viſibly amend. After the Operation of the Purgative is quite ceas'd, you muſt keep your Horſe eight Days longer to the Diet, as before.</p>
                     <p>If Horſes of Value, that are full of Mettle, and of a hot and dry Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were kept to this Diet, for a convenient ſpace of Time once every Year, 'twou'd infallibly preſerve 'em from ſeveral Diſtempers; and it is eſpecially uſeful at the End of a Campagne, or after a long Journey.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe looſe his Appetite when he begins to eat the <hi>Meal,</hi> (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not unfrequently) you may tye a <hi>Chewing-Ball</hi> to his Bit, renewing it ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till he begin to feed heartily on the <hi>Barley;</hi> for theſe <hi>Balls</hi> not only reſtore a loſt Appetite, but purifie the Blood, prevent Diſeaſes, and contribute to the Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of the Horſe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis Diſtemper has ſome Affinity with that which was laſt deſcrib'd, and is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd, when by reaſon of hard Labour, or ſome Indiſpoſition, as the Relicts of a <hi>Foundering,</hi> or exceſſive Heat of the Body, the Guts are ſtraiten'd, and the two <hi>Sinews</hi> that run along the <hi>Belly,</hi> from the <hi>Sheath</hi> to the <hi>Girding-place,</hi> reaching to that part of the <hi>Belly</hi> which the Horſe touches with his <hi>Thighs</hi> as he goes, grow hard and ſtiff, and ſo painful, that he loſes his Fleſh; and the Straitneſs of his <hi>Guts</hi> proceeds from the Dryneſs and Shrinking of the <hi>Sinews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure, you muſt let the Horſe blood in the <hi>Neck,</hi> and the next Day chafe the <hi>Sinews</hi> with this Ointment.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>An</hi> Anodyne Ointment.</head>
                        <p>For the Satisfaction of the Curious, I ſhall explain the Meaning of this Term of Art. Thoſe Remedies are ſaid to be <hi>Anodyne,</hi> which by a mild Heat, agreeable to that which is uſually call'd the <hi>Natural Heat,</hi> a temperate Moiſture, and a thin Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, inſinuating it ſelf into the Part where the Pain is ſeated, cheriſhes the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:179659:334"/>Heat, ſoftens and looſens the Part, and conſequently allays the Pain. From whence it may be infer'd, that an <hi>Anodyne</hi> Remedy is that which takes away the Pain from the Part to which 'tis apply'd.</p>
                        <p>Take the <hi>Ointments</hi> of <hi>Marſh-Mallows, Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Populeon,</hi> of each two Ounces, mix 'em cold: Or for want of theſe <hi>Ointments,</hi> the <hi>Fat</hi> of <hi>Chickens, Hens,</hi> or <hi>Capons,</hi> which is found near their Guts, or about their Breaſt, melted and ſtrain'd thro' a Linnen-Cloth, may be ſucceſsfully apply'd to the ſame uſes. Anoint the Sinews with the <hi>Ointment</hi> or <hi>Fat,</hi> holding a red-hot Bar of Iron near the part, to make the Remedy ſink into it.</p>
                        <p>The next Day, or ſome Days after, take hold of the <hi>Sinews</hi> with your two Fingers, and ſeparate 'em very gently from the <hi>Belly.</hi> The Day after renew the Application of the <hi>Ointment,</hi> and draw the <hi>Sinews</hi> as before, continuing after the ſame manner till they be ſufficient'y lengthen'd and relax'd; after which the Pain will ceaſe, and the Horſe regain his former Vigour and Luſtineſs.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time make a ſound Man, that Drinks unmixt Wine, Piſs on two double handfuls of <hi>Barley;</hi> and after it has ſtood in Infuſion a whole Night, pour off the <hi>Urine</hi> in the Morning. Then boil a handful of green (or, for want of theſe, dry) <hi>Fennel-ſeeds,</hi> in a Pint of Water for a quarter of an Hour, and ſprinkle the <hi>Barley</hi> with the <hi>Scum</hi> that ariſes in this Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Make your Horſe eat the <hi>Barley,</hi> thus prepar'd every Morning for the ſpace of fifteen Days, mixing it with a little <hi>Oats,</hi> if he ſeem to have an averſion againſt it, and keeping all other ſorts of Nouriſhment from him till he be accuſtom'd to eat this, which will promote the Cure effectually and reſtore his Appetite.</p>
                        <p>The Remedy deſcrib'd in the preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> conſiſting of a Preparation of <hi>Barley-Flower,</hi> is alſo very uſeful in this caſe, and with the aſſiſtance of the above-mention'd <hi>Ointment</hi> will reſtore the Horſe to his perfect Health.</p>
                        <p>Inſtead of <hi>Oats</hi> you may give your Horſe <hi>Rye</hi> ſprinkl'd with boiling Water, and afterwards drain'd and cool'd.</p>
                        <p>A double handful of <hi>Wheat,</hi> eaten always before you ſuffer him to Drink, will open his <hi>Flanks,</hi> and make him luſty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Honey'd-Water,</hi> or <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> prepar'd according to the Directions mention'd in one of the preceding <hi>Chapters,</hi> are very effectual in this caſe. If you perceive that your Horſe continues ſtill lean and meager, after the uſe of all theſe Remedies, give him either the <hi>Golden-Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in his <hi>Bran.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have often obſerv'd that <hi>lean</hi> Horſes are thought to be troubl'd with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, when their <hi>leanneſs</hi> proceeds from a multitude of <hi>Worms</hi> or <hi>Trunchions,</hi> that ſuck up all the Subſtance of their Food, and conſequently deprive all the parts of the Body of their uſual and neceſſary ſupplies of Nouriſhment. <hi>Trunchions</hi> are ſmall and ſhort Worms, ſmooth, and of a reddiſh Colour, which at laſt eat their paſſage thro' the Stomach, and occaſion preſent Death. They are never voided with the Dung, ſo that 'tis impoſſible to make a certain Judgment in this caſe: But when you have reaſon to ſuſpect that your Horſe is troubl'd with theſe pernicious Inſects, the ſafeſt way is to give him half an Ounce of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> with an Ounce of the <hi>Cordial Powder,</hi> in a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Butter,</hi> or an Ounce of <hi>Treacle</hi> without <hi>Butter,</hi> if the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> cannot be procur'd; or four Ounces of <hi>Cinnabar</hi> beaten to Powder, and mixt with a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter.</hi> Theſe Medicines will kill and deſtroy all the Worms, after which the Horſe will recover his Fleſh. If you propoſe the inward uſe of <hi>Cinnabar</hi> to a <hi>Phyſician</hi> that is not acquainted with the Conſtitution of <hi>Horſes,</hi> he will condemn it, and not without reaſon, knowing what a penetrating Faculty it has acquir'd by its <hi>Sublimation</hi> with <hi>Sulphur;</hi> ſo that 'tis certainly a very dangerous Medicine for <hi>Men,</hi> if it be not given with more than ordinary Caution: But you may adminiſter it to <hi>Horſes</hi> without any fear, and I dare warrant it both ſafe and effectual. The Confidence with which I recommend it, is grounded on a long Experience; and I have even made ſome Horſes eat ſeveral Pounds of it mixt with Bran, giving 'em one or two Ounces every Day with an equal quantity of the <hi>Cordial-Powder;</hi> by which Method I have cur'd the <hi>Farcin,</hi> without occaſioning the leaſt diſorder in the <hi>Gums,</hi> or any other part of the Body. I intend to deſcribe all the Remedies againſt <hi>Worms,</hi> in a <hi>Chapter</hi> that ſhall expreſly treat of that Subject; but if you are convinc'd that your Horſe is not troubl'd with <hi>Worms,</hi> you may give him one of the Remedies preſcrib'd for <hi>Surfeiting</hi> or <hi>Foundering in the Body.</hi> Or you may give him the <hi>Powder for a Cough,</hi> or the <hi>Lieutenant's Powder</hi> deſcrib'd in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part. Graſs,</hi> or <hi>Green Barley,</hi> if it be in ſeaſon, will Cure your Horſe without
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:179659:335"/>any other Remedy. In the Winter you may make him eat <hi>Beans</hi> moderately, and in the Summer give him <hi>Barley</hi> bruis'd (rather than Ground) in a Mill mixt with a little <hi>Bran.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXXXII. <hi>Of the</hi> Anticor.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Anticor</hi> is a preternatural Tumour caus'd by a ſanguine and choleric Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſeated on the <hi>Breaſt</hi> juſt oppoſite to the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Swelling is ſometimes generated in the ſpongy Membrane that ſurrounds the Heart, where the Humours eaſily lodge themſelves when they abound too much in the Body: The external Swelling diſcovers the Diſeaſe to the Eye; and beſides, 'tis accompany'd with a <hi>Palpitation of the Heart,</hi> and very often with a violent <hi>Fever.</hi> The ſick Horſe is heavy and ſad, hangs down his Head, and ſometimes falls to the Ground, and Swoons away.</p>
                     <p>This dangerous Diſtemper deſtroys the Appetite, and few eſcape when it enters into the Body: And even it proves oftentimes fatal, tho' it never enter into the Body, by reaſon of the redundancy or malignity of the Humours.</p>
                     <p>The uſual <hi>Ripening</hi> or <hi>Suppurating</hi> Remedies are of little uſe in this caſe; for the Venom contain'd in the Tumour wou'd infect the Heart by its malignant Vapours before it cou'd be expell'd by the Medicine.</p>
                     <p>You muſt begin the Cure with a <hi>Clyſter</hi> prepar'd after this manner. Boil two handfuls of <hi>Barley,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Polychreſt,</hi> reduc'd to a fine Powder, in the Quarts of Water, for the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour. Add to the ſtrain'd Liquor a Pint of the <hi>Urine</hi> of a <hi>Cow;</hi> or for want of that of a healthy and robuſt <hi>Boy,</hi> with a quarter of a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> and a like quantity of <hi>Oil of Rue,</hi> Repeat the <hi>Clyſter</hi> twice every Day, or oftner if need require: Then ſhave away the Hair in the lower part of the Swelling, and anoint the Part with one of the <hi>Retoires</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> LXXIV. two or three times ſucceſſively, till the Medicine pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, which will draw forth a reddiſh Water, and ſo either eaſe the Horſe, or ripen the Tumour, or at leaſt mark the place where you make an Inciſion. If the <hi>Anticor</hi> come to Suppuration, and the ſigns of the Concoction of the Matter appear, you may conclude that your Horſe is in a hopeful way of recovery.</p>
                     <p>The method of Cure commonly us'd by Farriers is not ſo ſure as that which I have already communicated; They draw a Circle with a hot Iron round the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and divide it equally by two Braſs Lines; then they pierce the Skin with an actual Cautery, or red-hot Iron, with a Button of the breadth of an Inch at the end of it, making ſeven or eight Holes beſides within the compaſs of the Circle. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they chafe the place once every Day with the following Ointment apply'd warm. Melt four Ounces of <hi>Baſilicum</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and adding four Ounces of old <hi>Treacle,</hi> and two Ounces of <hi>Oil of Rue,</hi> incorporate 'em well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether over the Fire. The <hi>Oil of Rue</hi> is endu'd with an excellent Virtue to draw or diſſolve theſe Tumours; and beſides, it ſeparates the Eſcar or Scab, and makes the corrupt Humours flow abundantly out of the Holes made with the hot Iron.</p>
                     <p>Before you proceed to <hi>give the Fire</hi> you muſt endeavour to make a <hi>Revulſion,</hi> by taking about a Pound and a half of Blood out of the <hi>Neck-Vein</hi> on the right ſide, taking care not to exceed that quantity, leaſt Nature be weaken'd by an immoderate expence of Blood, at a time when all her force is ſcarce ſufficient to reſiſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Humour. The next Day, if the Diſtemper be not accompany'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> or an extraordinary beating in the <hi>Flank,</hi> give your Horſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Potion.</hi>

                        <p>Inſtead of this <hi>Powder</hi> you may uſe the <hi>Treacle Powder,</hi> or the <hi>Electuary of Kermes;</hi> thus you may give him an Ounce of the <hi>Treacle Powder,</hi> with a like, or even double quantity of <hi>Confection of Hyacinth</hi> in a Quart of Wine; or two Ounces of the <hi>Electuary of Kermes,</hi> with half an Ounce of <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> in Powder.

                        </p>
                        <p>I know ſome that are wont, with very good ſucceſs, to begin the Cure with this <hi>Potion,</hi> preceded and follow'd by a <hi>Clyſter.</hi> You may alſo obſerve the following Method.</p>
                        <p>Make an Inciſion with your <hi>Fleam</hi> or <hi>Lancet</hi> in eight or ten ſeveral places on the Swelling, and thruſt into the Holes, between the Skin and the Fleſh, a piece of the Root of <hi>black Hellebor,</hi> of the bigneſs of the Tag of a Point. If the Tumour be very large you may uſe <hi>white Hellebor,</hi> and in either caſe you muſt remember to chafe the Part frequently with an Ointment, conſiſting of equal parts of <hi>Treacle,</hi> and the <hi>Ointments</hi> of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and of <hi>Marſh-Mallows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Roots of <hi>Hellebor</hi> raiſe the Swelling to a vaſt height, and draw forth the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom and Malignity of the Humour, which is the true deſign of the Application; and the <hi>Ointment</hi> ripens that ſtubborn and malignant Humour.</p>
                        <p>The next Day give your Horſe a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> boil'd in two Quarts of Beer, adding a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Oil of Bay,</hi> after the Decoction is remov'd from the Fire: And two Hours after the Injection of the <hi>Clyſter</hi> give him one of the <hi>Cordial Potions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe be very violent, 'twill be convenient to open a Vein a ſecond time, taking away about a Pound of Blood, and to continue the frequent uſe of <hi>Clyſters</hi> as before. You muſt alſo walk your Horſe from time to time, to provoke the natural Heat, to expel the offending Humour.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Retoire</hi> is more effectual than the Roots of <hi>Hellebor,</hi> tho' the laſt Method is not to be deſpis'd; but in either caſe the vehemency of the Diſeaſe does frequently prevent the Operation of <hi>external</hi> Remedies; and therefore the Cure chiefly depends on the timely and regular uſe of proper <hi>Cordials.</hi> The <hi>Eſſence of Vipers</hi> is a noble Remedy, if half an Ounce of it be mixt with a Pint of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Wine.</p>
                        <p>Since the Horſe has uſually few or no intervals of eaſe, and his Appetite is quite deſtroy'd by the violence of the Diſtemper, you muſt either give him an <hi>Armand,</hi> or feed him with cleans'd Barley: and obſerve the Method preſcrib'd in the Sixth and following Chapters.</p>
                        <p>Since the <hi>Oil of Rue</hi> is a good and cheap Remedy, it will not be improper to inſert the true deſcription of it.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>beating</hi> or <hi>palpitation</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> is a quick and violent Motion of that noble Part, by which it endeavours to expel ſomething that oppreſſes it. 'Tis uſually occaſion'd by a malignant Steam or Vapour, proceeding partly from a Melancholic Humour that ſtagnates in the Veins, and inſinuates it ſelf into the great Artery; hard Riding, violent Exerciſe, corrupt Water, bad Nouriſhment, and every thing that is apt to produce Heat or Obſtructions, are the remote Cauſes of this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Palpitation of the Heart</hi> is viſible to the Eye; for when the Diſeaſe is violent, the Heart beats with ſo much force againſt the Horſe's ſides, that you may plainly perceive the motion of the Skin at every ſtroke; and if you lay your Ear to the Part, you may hear, as it were, the Blows of a Hammer within the Horſe's Body, on both ſides together.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes in this Condition retain their Appetite better than others, and are not troubl'd with an extraordinary beating in the <hi>Flanks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remedies that ſtrengthen the Heart, cheriſh and revive the Spirits, diſpel thick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and reſiſt their Malignity, are proper in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleeding</hi> is the ſovereign Remedy of this Diſtemper; and it may be ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated oftner than once in one Day, if the violence of the <hi>Palpitation</hi> be not abated.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is ſometimes very vehement and impetuous, but not uſually Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, unleſs it be accompany'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> which does not happen very often.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is almoſt always ſucceſsfully perform'd by the frequently repeated uſe of convenient <hi>Clyſters, Bleeding,</hi> and <hi>Cordial</hi> Remedies.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cordials,</hi> you have the <hi>Electuary of Kermes,</hi> the <hi>Cordial-Powder,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenants-Powder,</hi> and the <hi>Cordial-Balls,</hi> which muſt be methodically exhibited, and the Doſe repeated two or three times according to the violence of the Diſtemper. If the <hi>Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> be accompany'd with a vehement beating in the <hi>Flanks,</hi> you muſt give your Horſe a Quart of a <hi>Cordial</hi> Mixture, of the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Scorzonera, Scabious, Carduus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> with an Ounce of <hi>Confection of Hyacinth,</hi> without <hi>Musk</hi> or <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſe,</hi> and one of the <hi>Cordial Balls</hi> reduc'd to Powder, rinſing the Pot and Horn with half a Pint of the ſame <hi>Cordial-Waters.</hi> The <hi>Cordials</hi> muſt be repeated every Day, or at leaſt once in two Days.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A Fever</hi> in Horſes is a preternatural and unuſual Heat in the Body, proceeding from an Ebullition or violent Fermentation of the Humours, which weakens the natural Heat, and renders it unfit for the regular diſcharge of its Functions. I cannot explain its nature better than by comparing it to the Ebullition of <hi>Wine</hi> in a Cask, where that Liquor is agitated, heated, dilated, and fermented; and if it be ſtraiten'd, or have no vent, it breaks impetuouſly thro' all obſtacles, ſpreads is Steams and Vapours all around, and appears ſo troubl'd and muddy that we cannot diſcern the leaſt drop of Wine in the Veſſel. But after theſe diſorderly Motions, all the Impurities that were contain'd in the Wine are ſeparated, the Lees fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, a ſort of Scum floats on the top, and the Concavity of the Veſſel is cover'd with a cruſty Subſtance. This is the true Idea and repreſentation of a <hi>Fever.</hi> When an unuſual Ebullition or Fermentation happens in the Maſs of the Blood, from what ever cauſe it proceeds, the Blood is agitated and put into a diſorderly Motion; it ſwells and breaks out of the Veſſels that are no longer able to contain it; it acquires a Heat that is obvious to Senſe, and fills the whole Body with Steams and Vapours, which ſtupifie the Head; and the Mixture of it is ſo extreamly perverted, that when you open a Vein, that which runs out of it ſeems to be corrupt Matter rather than
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:179659:337"/>Blood. When Nature gets the Victory over her Enemy, ſhe ſeparates and expels the impure and ſuperfluous Humours: And 'tis this ſtruggle of Nature that occaſions the burning Heat, extream Thirſt, heavineſs of the Body, difficulty of Breathing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive beating of the Arteries and Heart, and all that numerous Train of Symptoms which uſually accompany <hi>Fevers,</hi> and diſcover the Nature of the Diſtemper. 'Twou'd be an Undertaking of more Labour and Oſtentation than Profit, to engage in a long Diſſertation concerning the Cauſes, Differences, and Effects of <hi>Fevers.</hi> I am reſolv'd neither to give my Reader nor my ſelf ſo much Trouble, ſince few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are willing to employ their Time in ſuch nice Enquiries, and perhaps their want of Curioſity in this Caſe ought not to be eſteem'd a Fault. But I ſhall omit nothing that may ſerve to promote the Cure of this dangerous, and oftentimes fatal Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Some pretend to diſcover, by a diligent Obſervation of the <hi>Urine,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Nature in her Conflict with the Diſtemper, and the true State of the Body: But this Method is hardly practicable, in the Diſeaſes of Horſes, by reaſon of the Difficulty of procuring their <hi>Urine,</hi> to make Obſervations of that Nature.</p>
                     <p>The various Diſtinctions of <hi>Fevers,</hi> into <hi>Quotidians, Tertians, Quartans,</hi> &amp;c. are of no Uſe in this Caſe; and therefore I ſhall only take Notice of three Kinds of 'em.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>FEvers</hi> are uſually occaſion'd by all thoſe things that promote the Ebullition and Fermentation of the Humours; and particularly every thing that heats the Body, as violent Exerciſe, and the uſe of hot Aliments, eſpecially in Summer; to which we may add whatever is apt to breed Fulneſs or Repletion in the Body, which oppreſſes Nature, and renders her unable to ſubdue thoſe rebellious Humours that ſtagnate in the Veſſels, where they are putrefy'd and fermented. Sometimes a <hi>Fever</hi> proceeds from Obſtructions in the excretory Paſſages, eſpecially thoſe in the habit of the Body, which are very numerous; or by a ſtoppage of the free and natural Motion of the Blood, that performs ſo many Rounds every Day, paſſing from the <hi>Heart</hi> thro' the <hi>Arteries</hi> to the <hi>Veins,</hi> and from thence returning to the <hi>Heart.</hi> Thus if a Horſe, that is heated by hard Riding, or any violent Exerciſe, be ſuddenly expos'd to the cold Air, or drink very cold Water, the leaſt tendency, to a <hi>Fever</hi> will diſcover it ſelf, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally break forth into a Diſtemper, which perhaps lurk'd in his Body before. And to conclude, the leaſt Diſturbance in the natural Diſpoſition of the Body is apt on ſome Occaſions to produce a <hi>Fever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of a <hi>Fever</hi> are theſe; A violent <hi>Beating</hi> in the <hi>Flanks, Heat</hi> of the <hi>Mouth, Tongue,</hi> and all the reſt of the Body, <hi>Swelling</hi> of the <hi>Veins,</hi> and <hi>Beating</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> againſt the Sides: The ſick Horſe breathes thick, and with Difficulty, reels frequently as he goes, ſeldom lies down; and when he is laid, ſtarts up ſuddenly, becauſe the Difficulty of Breathing is increas'd by that Poſture; forſakes his Meat entirely, or eats only by Starts; takes no notice of thoſe who come near him, nor turns his Head, tho' you make a noiſe behind him: Takes no care of himſelf, and at laſt remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, as if he were perfectly ſtupid, and depriv'd of all his Senſes. His Lips and Ears hang down, his Eyes ſeem ſad and ſhining, a ſharp and piercing Heat is ſpread over all his Body, and all the Symptoms of a violent Oppreſſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appear.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall proceed to lay down ſome general <hi>Rules</hi> to be obſerv'd in the <hi>Cure</hi> of all Sorts of <hi>Fevers.</hi> And <hi>firſt,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt keep your Horſe to a very ſpare Diet; for if the Fever continue three Days without Intermiſſion, you may conclude that he is in extreme Danger, and therefore he may well faſt, or at leaſt be contented with a very ſmall Quantity of Nouriſhment in ſo ſhort a time; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells us in his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> That <hi>when a Diſeaſe is at the Height, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to obſerve a very thin Diet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you may eaſily perceive the dangerous Errour of thoſe, who if a Horſe be troubl'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> and faſt twenty four Hours, immediately give him <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Yolks</hi> of <hi>Eggs,</hi> which is a very unwholſome kind of Nouriſhment in this Caſe, and encreaſes the Diſtemper. Beſides it muſt be given with a <hi>Horn,</hi> and the Violence of that Method of Feeding him, augments the Difficulty of Breathing, and diſturbs him when he ſtands moſt in need of Reſt. You muſt therefore content your ſelf with endeavouring to make him eat ſomething of his own Accord; for a ſmall quantity of Nouriſhment given after this Manner, will produce a better Effect than all that you can pour into his Mouth with a <hi>Horn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis a Rule of great Importance in the Cure of <hi>Fevers,</hi> never to exhibit a <hi>purging</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; for in ſo great a Confuſion of the Humors, it's impoſſible for Nature to evacuate thoſe that offend her, till ſhe has ſeparated 'em from the reſt of the Maſs; and 'tis plain that the Execution of ſo laborious a Work requires a conſiderable ſpace of Time. And beſides, the Operation of a <hi>purgative</hi> Medicine heats the Body, and cauſes a Pain in the Guts, which may not improbably breed an Inflammation. 'Tis alſo convenient to keep the ſick Horſe always bridl'd, unleſs for ſo long time as muſt be neceſſarily allow'd him for Eating.</p>

                        <p>An Hour after he has voided the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> tye a <hi>Chewing-Ball</hi> to his Bit, and give him two Ounces of Powder of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in a Quart of Beer; or a <hi>Ptiſan,</hi> which may expel the Humours by Urine, without heating the Body.</p>
                        <p>The next Day after rubb his whole Body with a Wiſp of Straw or Hay, to open the Pores of the Skin, that the Steams or Excrements of the third Concoction may exhale; which, if they were ſuffer'd to remain in the Body, wou'd oppreſs the Blood that ſtands in need of a free and unobſtructed Motion.</p>
                        <p>His ordinary Drink may be thus prepar'd; Melt four Ounces of <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> in a ſufficient quantity of Water, and after 'tis cold, mix it with a little Flower, and let your Horſe drink as much as he pleaſes; for this Drink allays the Heat of the Entrails, reſiſts Corruption, and opens the Paſſages: Beſides, it ſtops that Ebullition or Fermentation, which is the uſual Cauſe of all <hi>Fevers,</hi> and evacuates the Humours by Urine, which is the right Paſſage thro' which they ſhou'd be expell'd.</p>
                        <p>As for his Food, you muſt give him Leaves of <hi>Succory, Lettuce, Dandelion,</hi> or of <hi>Vines,</hi> but little or no <hi>Hay,</hi> and leſs <hi>Oats;</hi> for either of theſe are apt to heat the Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipate the Belly, and harden the Excrements: If you conſider the ſhort continuance of the Diſeaſe, you will not be troubl'd at the ſmall quantity of Nouriſhment that your Horſe is allow'd to take. If it laſt above three Days, take <hi>Aſſa-faetida</hi> and <hi>Savin</hi> groſsly beaten, of each half an Ounce; <hi>Sugar</hi> and Raſpings of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> of each an Ounce; Tie 'em to the Bit in a Linnen Bag, and make him champ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it frequentlty. This Medicine will purge the Brain, and make him eat of his own Accord, which is abſolutely the beſt way of Feeding; afterwards you may give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> with <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Powder, which will infallibly reſtore his Appetite.</p>
                        <p>If his Averſion to his Meat continue, you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Horn,</hi> and give him cleans'd <hi>Barley,</hi> without the Addition of <hi>Butter</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> which will nouriſh and moiſten his Body. The <hi>Barley</hi> muſt be boil'd in Water for the ſpace of five Hours over a gentle Fire, then ſtrain and mix it with a convenient quantity of <hi>Sugar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take a Pound and a quarter of <hi>Barley</hi>-flower, well boulted, and ſeparated from the Bran; boil it in two Quarts of Water to the Conſiſtency of thick Broth, then add two Ounces of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and give it to your Horſe luke-warm. This Draught will ſerve to ſuſtain him twenty four Hours, at the end of which it may be repeated.</p>
                        <p>If the Violence of the Diſtemper be not abated, you may <hi>bleed</hi> your Horſe a ſecond time. The continu'd Uſe of <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and frequent rubbing of the Body are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very profitable in thoſe Caſes.</p>
                        <p>The Knowledge of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is of very great Importance for the right Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Cure,</hi> and therefore if the Fever be occaſion'd by expoſing your Horſe to the <hi>Cold</hi> or <hi>Night-Air,</hi> you muſt keep him cover'd, rubb his Body frequently, and continue the frequent Uſe of <hi>Clyſters.</hi> If the Diſtemper proceed from hard <hi>Labour</hi> and violent <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> you muſt boil the Water that ſerves for his ordinary Drink, and mix it with <hi>Barley</hi> Meal, feeding him with <hi>Vine</hi> Leaves, if they be in Seaſon; and if you can make him eat 'em without Reluctancy, or with <hi>Panado</hi> or <hi>Bread</hi> bak'd with <hi>Sugar,</hi> without <hi>Fat, Butter,</hi> or <hi>Salt.</hi>

                        <p>If the Fever be caus'd by <hi>unwholſome Food,</hi> 'twill be convenient to repeat the <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and to inject <hi>Clyſters</hi> compos'd of a ſufficient quantity of a Decoction of the <hi>ſoftening Herbs,</hi> with a Handful of <hi>Pigeon's Dung</hi> beaten ſmall, half a Pound of <hi>ſalt Butter,</hi> and a Pint of <hi>Emetic Wine.</hi> I have always obſerv'd the Efficacy of <hi>Emetic Wine</hi> in <hi>Clyſters;</hi> but you muſt take care not to abuſe ſo uſeful a Remedy; for ſince <hi>Fevers,</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, and oftentimes Fatal, 'tis the uſual Cuſtom to lay the Blame of the Horſe's Death on the <hi>Medicines,</hi> without taking notice of the Violence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>

                     <p>THis Kind of Fever commonly attacks young Horſes, eſpecially thoſe who are vigorous, and of a ſlender Make. It may be eaſily known by theſe Signs; The ſick Horſe hangs his Head, as if he were quite ſtupid; is hardly able to keep his Eyes open, and reels as he goes, by reaſon of the Aſcent of Vapours to the Brain; his Tongue, and Roof of his Mouth are blackiſh, rough, and dry; there is a great Heat over all his Body; his Eyes are red, his Breath hot and ſharp, and his Flanks beat violently.</p>
                     <p>You muſt immediately let him blood, ſometimes in the <hi>Neck, Temple,</hi> or <hi>Eye-Veins,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>Brisket, Flanks,</hi> or <hi>Veins</hi> of the <hi>Thighs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bleeding</hi> ventilates, leſſens the Redundancy, and facilitates the Motion of the Humours. It prevents the Breaking of the Veſſels, allays, in ſome meaſure, the Ebullition, tempers the Heat, and by taking away part of the Cauſe of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, gives Nature an Opportunity to ſubdue the reſt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt allow him no more Nouriſhment than is juſt ſufficient to keep him from ſtarving. <hi>Green Barley, Dandelion,</hi> and the Tops of <hi>Vine</hi> Leaves are very proper in this Caſe; or for want of theſe a little <hi>moiſten'd Bran, Bread,</hi> and a very ſmall quantity of <hi>Hay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his ordinary Drink, boil two Ounces of <hi>white Tartar,</hi> beaten to fine Powder, in two Quarts of Water, for a quarter of an Hour; then pour the Decoction into a Pailful of Water, with a Handful of <hi>Barley</hi> Flower, and let him drink as much as he pleaſes: You may alſo mix the following <hi>Febrifuge</hi> with his Drink, which is an excellent and cheap Remedy.</p>

                        <p>Put a Quart of Water with two Ounces of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> in a Brazen Pot with a Cover, and ſet it over the Fire till the <hi>Salt</hi> be diſſolv'd; then pour the Water into a Pail, and after the ſame manner diſſolve an Ounce of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> beaten to Powder, in another Quart of Water. Mix this laſt Solution with the former, and fill up the Pail with common Water; if your Horſe refuſe to drink it, add a little <hi>Barley</hi> Flower to qualifie the unpleaſant Taſte. This Drink will allay the Heat of the Fever, quiet and ſtop the Fermentation and Ebullition of the Humours, provoke Urine powerfully, and wonderfully eaſe the ſick Horſe. And therefore you muſt always pour a little of this <hi>Febrifuge</hi> into the Water you give him to drink, neglecting the Uſe of <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> ſince 'tis not expedient to confound Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and the <hi>Febrifuge</hi> excels all the reſt that can be preſcrib'd.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Aſſa-faetida</hi> and <hi>Savin,</hi> both in Powder, of each half an Ounce; tye 'em in a Bag to your Horſe's Bit, and never unbridle him, unleſs when you think fit to ſuffer him to eat or drink.</p>
                        <p>There are no other internal Remedies uſeful in this Caſe, but the <hi>Cordial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which by Virtue of their Eſſential Qualities, ſtrengthen the Heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it to reſiſt the Malignity of the unnatural Heat, that oppoſes and endeavours to deſtroy that which is Natural; and beſides, by reaſon of their Moiſture, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and temper that internal Heat which cauſes the <hi>Fever.</hi> Take three Pints of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:179659:339"/>the Waters of <hi>Scabious, Carduus Benedictus, Scorzonera,</hi> and <hi>Queen of the Meadows,</hi> with an Ounce of the <hi>Confection of Alkermes:</hi> Make your Horſe drink up the whole Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and repeat it the next Day, if need require.</p>
                        <p>Above all, you muſt continue, and frequently repeat the uſe of <hi>Clyſters,</hi> injecting three or four every Day, if there be occaſion: For there is no Remedy gives greater eaſe, and relieves the Horſe more effectually.</p>

                     <p>THE Cure of this <hi>Fever</hi> is different from that of the laſt, and is perform'd by ſtrengthning Nature, in correcting the malignity of the Poyſon that cauſes the Diſorder: For the removal of the Cauſe is the moſt probable way to put an end to the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe you muſt inject <hi>Clyſters</hi> frequently, and give repeated Doſes of the <hi>Cordial Pills,</hi> or the <hi>Electuary of Kermes,</hi> obſerving almoſt the ſame Directions that are preſcrib'd for the Cure of the <hi>Anticor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I once obſerv'd a great Mortality of Horſes in <hi>Germany,</hi> few eſcaping that were once ſeiz'd with the Diſtemper. Almoſt all of 'em voided a great quantity of Water at the Eyes, they were troubl'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> and a ſtrong Averſion to their Meat, the tips of their Ears were cold, and a certain yellow and greeniſh Matter dropt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly from their Noſe.</p>
                     <p>At firſt ſeveral Remedies were try'd in vain; but at laſt I invented one that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a great number of Cures.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Diſeaſe appear'd, the Horſe was let Blood before he was ſuffer'd to Drink, but if he had already Drunk, the bleeding was delay'd till the next Day. He was kept Bridl'd two or three Hours after; then the following Remedy was exhibited;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:179659:340"/>after which he ſtood Bridl'd two Hours longer, and a Man was order'd to walk him half an Hour.</p>
                     <p>Take new <hi>Treacle,</hi> not above three Months old, and <hi>Aloes Hepatica</hi> in Powder, of each one Ounce, <hi>Confection of Hyacinth,</hi> and of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> without <hi>Musk</hi> or <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſe,</hi> of each half an Ounce, diſſolve 'em in a Decoction made with <hi>Scabious, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Speedwel,</hi> of each a large handful. 'Twas obſerv'd, that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Waters</hi> of thoſe Herbs, when they cou'd be procur'd, were more effectual than the <hi>Decoction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next, and the following Days <hi>Clyſters</hi> were Injected, and if the violence of the Diſtemper did not abate, the Remedy was repeated, taking only one half of the preſcrib'd Doſes of the <hi>Treacle, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Confections,</hi> but the quantity of the Liquor was not leſſen'd. This Remedy cur'd all the Horſes to whom it was exhibited, but perhaps would not ſucceed ſo well on another occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I order'd new <hi>Treacle</hi> to be us'd, becauſe that Medicine acquires a great deal of Heat by being long kept, and all the cooling Virtue of the <hi>Opium</hi> that enters its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition vaniſhes.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be occaſion'd by the Contagion of the Air, as ſoon as you perceive your Stable to be infected, remove inſtantly all your ſound Horſes, without permiting 'em to enter into it again, till you have perfum'd it with equal Parts of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> and double quantities of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Pitch.</hi> Or you may make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Perfume</hi> by burning a <hi>Faggot</hi> of green <hi>Juniper</hi>-Wood, the Doors and Windows being ſhut: And you muſt alſo whiten the Walls, waſh the Rack, and make the whole Stable clean.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>biting</hi> of <hi>Venemous Beaſts,</hi> you may conſult the Hundred and thirteenth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe has ſwallow'd Poyſon make him drink a great quantity of <hi>Oil,</hi> and give him <hi>Orvietan, Treacle,</hi> or the <hi>Electuary of Kermes;</hi> and the <hi>Cordial Pills</hi> are alſo proper in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe happens to ſwallow <hi>Arſenic,</hi> if his Stomach be void, 'tis impoſſible to prevent his Death, if he be not aſſiſted in leſs than an Hour; for during that time the <hi>Arſenic</hi> is able to burn and utterly conſume the Part to which it ſticks.

                           <hi>Of the Method to be obſerv'd after a Horſe's Recovery from a</hi> Fever.</head>
                        <p>When a <hi>Fever</hi> actually prevails, you muſt not exhibit a <hi>Purgative</hi> Remedy; for that wou'd be a no leſs prepoſterous attempt, than if you ſhou'd endeavour to ſeparate the Lees from the Wine, during its Fermentation. There are only two caſes in which a <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy can be adminiſter'd with ſafety or ſucceſs in a <hi>Fever.</hi> In the firſt place, it may be given for the evacuation of corrupt Humours floating in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts, and it muſt be acknowledg'd, that the removal of thoſe Humours wou'd be advantagious to the Horſe. But ſince they are not the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, that advantage wou'd be very inconſiderable, with reſpect to the damage which Nature cou'd not avoid receiving by the heat and acrimony of the Remedy, and by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and unuſual Motion excited by it. The other caſe in which <hi>Purgation</hi> is not only uſeful but neceſſary, is when Nature after the agitation of the Humours during the <hi>Fever,</hi> ſeparates the corrupt from the pure Humours; for ſhe is often ſo weaken'd and render'd ſo lazy by the violence of her late Conflict, that ſhe contents her ſelf with the Victory ſhe has gain'd, and is either unable or unwilling to attempt the utter overthrow and expulſion of her Enemy, who ſeems to be perfectly quieted, but may afterwards return to the aſſault with a more dangerous Fury than before. As ſoon therefore as you perceive a remiſſion or ceſſation of Arms, you muſt take hold of that occaſion, to aſſiſt Nature to compleat the ruine of her Adverſary. 'Tis true, <hi>Purgatives</hi> are repugnant rather than agreeable to Nature; but 'tis certain, ſhe receives an accidental benefit by 'em; for when they are in the Body they irritate and offend
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:179659:340"/>he Parts thro' which they paſs, and Nature perceiving thoſe new Commotions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to expel the cauſe of 'em; and in the ſtruggle drives forth the remainders of the Humours that not long before had almoſt overwhelm'd her, as if the Operation of the Medicine had rouz'd her, and put her in mind of her Duty. You muſt not wait for the Marks of the Concoction, and ſeparation of the Humours from the Urine or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Horſes; For 'tis impoſſible to perceive the leaſt ſign of Nature's Victory in 'em: But you may confidently and ſafely proceed to the uſe of <hi>Purgatives,</hi> as ſoon as you ſee the <hi>Tempeſt</hi> ſucceeded by a <hi>Calm.</hi> In the mean time 'twill be convenient to adminiſter <hi>cooling</hi> Remedies for ſome Days, ſuch as <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> in Wine, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the latent Fire that lies bury'd in the Embers after the Flame is ſeemingly quench'd, and to recruit the Horſe's ſtrength by a good and wholſome, but ſpare Diet; for 'tis a dangerous Error to imagine, that the abundance or large quantity of Nouriſhment repairs the decay'd Vigour of the Horſe's Body: For if the Stomach be over-loaded with Food, it cannot duly perform the work of Digeſtion, without which the Aliments are not only uſeleſs, but very hurtful. After you have ſpent ſome time in endeavouring to ſtrengthen and cheriſh Nature, you may give ſuch a <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy as you have reaſon to believe is leaſt apt to diſturb her. There is a great variety of thoſe Medicines; but we ſhou'd be taught by Experience to reject thoſe that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerv'd to occaſion Diſorders in the Body, and to make uſe of ſuch as are moſt likely to anſwer your Deſign and Expectation. 'Tis in my Opinion a very hard Task to diſcover the peculiar Nature and Properties of the offending Humour; and to chooſe <hi>Specific</hi> Remedies for the evacuation of <hi>Choler, Flegm,</hi> or any other particular Humour. <hi>Sal-Polychreſt</hi> purges gently, and almoſt inſenſibly: And I have ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully us'd the following Remedy, which I recommend as one of the beſt and moſt effectual Medicines that can be propos'd in this caſe.</p>

                        <p>Take Powder of <hi>white Tartar,</hi> and fine <hi>Nitre,</hi> of each two Ounces, put 'em in an Earthen Diſh, and kindle 'em with a live Coal. After the Matter is ſufficiently burnt and cold, beat it to a fine Powder; put it into a Quart of Water, with a like quantity of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> and four Ounces of <hi>Sena,</hi> and let 'em ſtand all Night in a cold Infuſion.</p>
                        <p>Take of fine Powder of <hi>Scammony</hi> half an Ounce, for an ordinary Horſe, or five Drams for one of a very large ſize; incorporate it in a Mortar, with half a Pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> prepar'd with the Herb <hi>Mercury:</hi> Then pour on your ſtrain'd Infuſion, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it gently with the <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Scammony,</hi> with the Peſtle, and give the whole quantity to your Horſe, keeping him Bridl'd four Hours before, and three Hours after.</p>
                        <p>Give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> and twenty four Hours after walk him gently for the ſpace of an Hour to facilitate the Operation of the Medicine.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a peculiar Excellency of this Remedy, that it <hi>Purges</hi> effectually without <hi>heating</hi> the Body: For tho' <hi>Infuſions</hi> are generally free from the exceſſive heat of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, even <hi>in Subſtance,</hi> they rarely procure a plentiful Evacuation: But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy operates powerfully, tho' the <hi>Sena</hi> be not given in Powder; for the <hi>Scammony,</hi> and <hi>Honey of Mercury</hi> produce the deſir'd effect, becauſe the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> opens the Body of the <hi>Sena,</hi> and enables the Decoction to extract its <hi>eſſential Salt,</hi> in which its <hi>Purgative</hi> quality is lodg'd.</p>
                        <p>This Medicine may be ſafely adminiſter'd to Horſes of a hot and fiery Conſtitution, when they are extreamly fatigu'd with violent Exerciſe; and on all other occaſions when they ſtand in need of Purgation, without any danger of heating and inflaming their Bodies.</p>

                     <p>TAke of the Roots of <hi>Flower de Luce</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> half a Pound; <hi>Sena,</hi> fine <hi>Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Hermodactyls,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white Hellebor,</hi> of each two Ounces, <hi>Indian Pine-Nuts,</hi> an Ounce. Beat all the Ingredients to a groſs Powder, and put 'em into a large Pot with three Quarts of Water, an Ounce of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and four Ounces of <hi>Sal-Prunellae</hi> in Powder; let 'em ſtand in a cold Infuſion three Days, and as many Nights, ſtirring 'em from time to time; then ſtrain out the Liquor thro' a very thick Canvas-Bag, and evaporate it with a gentle Heat over a clear Fire, till there be about a Quart remaining, to which add a Pound and half of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Honey,</hi> and boil it to the thickneſs of a <hi>Syrup;</hi> then put in <hi>Jalap</hi> and <hi>Turbith,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> and <hi>Gum-Gotte,</hi> of each two Ounces; <hi>Scammony</hi> one Ounce; green <hi>Anniſeed</hi> and <hi>Fennel-ſeed,</hi> of each two Ounces; all beaten to a fine Powder, and well ſears'd: Boil to the thickneſs of an <hi>Electuary,</hi> ſtirring perpetually.</p>
                     <p>The Doſe is from three Ounces to three Ounces and a half, diſſolv'd in any of the uſual Decoctions for a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> without <hi>Honey, Oil,</hi> or any other addition. It operates very effectually, and is an univerſal Purger of all bad and corrupt Humours.</p>
                     <p>I muſt acknowledge, that I cou'd never yet adminiſter a <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy, without dreading the event, even after a hundred ſucceſsful Tryals: For certainly the Motion occaſion'd by thoſe Remedies is contrary, and even oftentimes deſtructive to Nature; and there are ſo many <hi>Aſpects</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Stars</hi> that may occaſion great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders after the uſe of thoſe Remedies, that I never give 'em without an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And it has been frequently obſerv'd, that for want of a regular Preparation of the Horſe's Body, or perhaps of a due obſervation of the Heavens, ſeveral Horſes have been <hi>Founder'd,</hi> and even kill'd, by Remedies that have been given with ſucceſs a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times before. But ſince, according to the uſual Proverb, <hi>Neceſſity knows no Law,</hi> we are ſometimes oblig'd to break thro' all thoſe Conſiderations, chooſing the leaſt dangerous Medicines, and obſerving all poſſible Precautions. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Clyſters</hi> are ſafe and gentle Remedies; for the moſt powerful <hi>Purgatives</hi> perform their Operation without the leaſt diſturbance, when they are injected at the Fundament: And this is a true <hi>Catholicum,</hi> that is, an <hi>univerſal</hi> Remedy, fit, or rather neceſſary for all thoſe that go to the Army, where many Horſes periſh for want of a duly prepar'd <hi>Clyſter.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXXXIX. <hi>Of the</hi> Farcin.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Farcin</hi> is a Swelling that frequently appears with an Ulcer, caus'd by the corruption of the Blood, and that by a certain Poyſon which is more or leſs Malignant, and conſequently makes the Horſe's condition, either hopeful, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperate. When any Part that is neceſſary, or of conſiderable uſe and importance for the regular performance of the Vital Functions, fails in the diſcharge of its Office, by reaſon of ſome defect in its Temperament, Figure, or Contexture, the economy or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Body muſt unavoidably ſuffer a great and dangerous alteration. If the Part be neceſſary for <hi>Sanguification,</hi> the mixture of the Blood is diſturb'd and perverted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vitiated conſtitution of the Part affected, it receives a noxious Impreſſion, and oftentimes acquires an acid, hot, and corroſive quality, that eats and conſumes the Parts where it ſtagnates; as it appears evidently in the <hi>Farcin,</hi> which ſpreads almoſt over the whole Body, and is originally occaſion'd, not by the acid and frequently malignant Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of all the Humours, but by the Poyſon that infects the principal Humour, or the Blood; and therefore the malignity of the Humours is only the effect of the Poyſon that cauſes the diſorders in the Blood. The radical and methodical Cure of this Diſtemper is perform'd by removing the cauſe of it, that is, by purifying and ſweetning the Blood; in order to which I ſhall propoſe ſeveral Remedies.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:179659:341"/>
                        <hi>Van Helmont</hi> ſays that the <hi>French Pox</hi> had its Original from the <hi>Farcin</hi> in Horſes; and 'tis generally agreed that in the Cure of that Diſtemper the Malignity of its Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be deſtroy'd, and the Blood afterwards purify'd and rectify'd; after which all the Symptoms diſappear: The ſame may be apply'd to the <hi>Farcin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Farcin</hi> is inveterate, or of long continuance, the Blood being utterly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Poiſon that is lodg'd in it, acquires ſo virulent an Acrimony, that it ulcerates the <hi>Lungs</hi> or the <hi>Liver,</hi> by its exceſſive Heat and Malignity: For when the Blood returns from the <hi>Brain,</hi> according to the eſtabliſh'd Laws of its Circulation, to the <hi>Right Ventricle</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> it paſſes from thence by the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> to the <hi>Lungs,</hi> which conſiſting of a ſpongy, foul, and moiſt Subſtance, are heated by the ſharp Spirits contain'd in the deprav'd Blood. This preternatural Heat occaſions a Corruption of the weakeſt Parts, and afterwards an <hi>Ulcer,</hi> which at laſt deſtroys and conſumes the whole Subſtance of the <hi>Lungs:</hi> You may be eaſily convinc'd of the Truth of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> by opening the Body of a Horſe, whoſe Death is occaſion'd by an inveterate <hi>Farcin;</hi> for you will find the <hi>Lungs</hi> wholly putrefy'd and full of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> caus'd by the hot and corrupt Blood, which alſo vitiates and ulcerates the <hi>Liver.</hi> 'Tis plain then that the Cure depends chiefly on the Cooling of the Blood, and the utter Deſtruction of that Poiſon which cauſes the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and all its loathſome Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>For a brief Explanation of the Nature of that <hi>Poiſon,</hi> 'twill be ſufficient to tell you, that 'tis a <hi>venomous Steam,</hi> or certain corrupt <hi>Spirits,</hi> which penetrate the Parts of a Horſe's Body, as the Light of the Sun paſſes thro' a Glaſs. Theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> are a ſort of <hi>Ferment</hi> that breeds Corruption in whatſoever part they attack: And 'tis to be obſerv'd that this Poiſon can never be deſtroy'd by <hi>purgative</hi> Medicines, without the Uſe of <hi>Specifics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is ſometimes communicated by Contagion from an infected Horſe; 'tis alſo occaſion'd by eating too great a quantity of (eſpecially new) <hi>Oats,</hi> or new <hi>Hay,</hi> before 'tis purg'd by evaporating its ſuperfluous Moiſture, which uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens about two Months after 'tis put up in Stacks, or in a Barn. Violent Exerciſe in hot Weather, and even once hard Riding, Hurts or Wounds made with a foul or Cancerous Iron-Inſtrument, ſuch as Spurs, Bits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the too great Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood may alſo cauſe this Diſtemper. It proceeds not unfrequently from a prepoſterous and too haſty Diligence, in fattening tyr'd, lean, and over-heated Horſes; for too great Abundance of Nouriſhment breeds the <hi>Farcin,</hi> unleſs it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by moderate Exerciſe and often-repeated Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>The moſt dangerous and ſtubborn Kind of <hi>Farcin,</hi> is that which is accompany'd with a <hi>Running at the Noſe;</hi> for aſſoon as you perceive that Symptom, you may conclude, that your Horſe's Death approaches; eſpecially if his Appetite be loſt, and the Matter that runs out be mixt with Blood. The Number of thoſe which eſcape is ſo ſmall, that all Horſes in this Condition may be given over for deſperate, unleſs the <hi>Running at the Noſe</hi> proceed from the <hi>Strangles,</hi> and even in that Caſe the Diſeaſe is uſually fatal.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is very difficult, when the <hi>Farcin</hi> appears firſt on the <hi>hinder Legs</hi> near the <hi>Paſtern,</hi> or on the <hi>Fetlock-Joint,</hi> and even in the <hi>Hough,</hi> aſcending along the Thigh; for it is a Sign of the Violence of the Infection, and Weakneſs of the Natural Heat, when the <hi>Farcin-Knots</hi> appear in the extreme Parts of the Body at ſo great a diſtance from the <hi>Heart;</hi> even as the <hi>Gout</hi> is more troubleſome when it makes its firſt Attack near the <hi>Toe,</hi> or <hi>Ankle-Bone,</hi> than when it begins nearer the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Knots</hi> cannot be brought to Suppuration, but inſtead of Matter thruſt forth a piece of reddiſh brown Fleſh, which grows very faſt, and can neither be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by Burning, nor <hi>Cauſtic</hi> Ointments, the Cure is alſo very difficult, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, without the Help of powerful Remedies to deſtroy the inward Poiſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Farcins</hi> that are brought from the Camp are very rarely cur'd; becauſe the Blood is wholly corrupted by violent or unſeaſonable Exerciſes, and by the Defect or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Nouriſhment, which very often is rotten and unwholſome.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Farcin</hi> that begins to appear during the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> is ſtubborn, and leſs eaſily cureable than that which begins in the <hi>Wane,</hi> when the Humours are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and leſs abundant: and the ſame Obſervation may be apply'd to the <hi>Glanders</hi> and <hi>Quitter-bone.</hi> The <hi>Farcin</hi> in the <hi>Head</hi> is the leaſt dangerous, and moſt eaſily cur'd of all other Kinds of that Diſtemper, unleſs when there is a <hi>Knot,</hi> or <hi>Kernel,</hi> between the two <hi>Jaw-bones,</hi> which is uſually nouriſh'd by a certain Flegmatic Matter that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:179659:342"/>comes from the <hi>Lungs</hi> thro' the <hi>Wind-Pipe;</hi> for theſe <hi>Kernels</hi> can hardly be diſſolv'd in leſs than three or four Months, and in the mean time the Horſe is in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the <hi>Glanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may conclude that the Cure will be difficult, when the <hi>Thighs</hi> are much ſwoll'n, when there are hard <hi>Knots</hi> on the <hi>Sheath,</hi> or when the Swellings break, and inſtead of <hi>Matter</hi> put forth a piece of <hi>blackiſh Fleſh</hi> like a <hi>Hen's Fundament;</hi> but the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and hardly curable Kind of <hi>Farcin</hi> is, when the Horſe is naturally of a ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and tender <hi>Stomach;</hi> for 'tis impoſſible to give him the Remedies that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Cure, without deſtroying his <hi>Appetite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Knot</hi> that appears firſt is heal'd, the Horſe is uſually in a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, tho' at the ſame time there be ſeveral other <hi>Knots</hi> in his Body: But this is not an infallible Rule.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Farcin</hi> is call'd by the <hi>Italians, Verme,</hi> and by the <hi>Germans, <hi>Wurme,</hi>
                        </hi> becauſe it ſeems to gnaw and bite between the Fleſh and Skin, as <hi>Worms</hi> gnaw the Bark of a Tree.</p>
                     <p>It may be eaſily known by the <hi>Knots</hi> and <hi>Cords</hi> that run along the <hi>Veins,</hi> and are ſpread over the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo diſcover'd by <hi>Tumours</hi> and <hi>Ulcers;</hi> and aſſoon as you perceive an ulcerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Swelling in the <hi>Emunctories,</hi> which are <hi>Kernels</hi> ſituated between the <hi>Jaws</hi> and the <hi>Neck,</hi> and on the <hi>Breaſt</hi> and <hi>Thighs,</hi> near the <hi>Cods,</hi> and deſign'd by Nature to receive the Impurities of the Body, and the Defluxions that fall upon thoſe Parts, you may conclude that your Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Farcin,</hi> which is more or leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, according to the degrees of the Ulceration, and the ſticking of the <hi>Kernels</hi> to the Fleſh: for if it be ſeated only in the Subſtance of the <hi>Hide,</hi> and may be eaſily mov'd with your Fingers, it may be cur'd without much Difficulty before it break the Skin.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> one of the moſt promiſing Signs of a ſpeedy Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, is when the <hi>Cords</hi> or <hi>Knots</hi> grow looſe and moveable; and therefore ſuch as are naturally looſe may be quickly cur'd with a very moderate degree of Care.</p>
                     <p>Horſes that are troubl'd with the <hi>Farcin</hi> are uſually brisk and lively; they eat and drink as when they were in Health, and diſcover not the leaſt Sign of Sickneſs by their Actions; they are as capable of enduring Labour or Travel as ever; and even moderate Exerciſe promotes the Cure, by diſſipating and expelling part of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that cauſes the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Some reckon up <hi>ſeven,</hi> and others <hi>eight</hi> Sorts of this Diſtemper; but I ſhall only divide it into <hi>four</hi> Kinds, to which all the reſt may be reduc'd.</p>

                     <p>TO proceed methodically in the Cure of this Diſeaſe, you muſt begin with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Medicines before you proceed to external Applications; for 'twou'd be to no Purpoſe to extirpate the <hi>Tumours,</hi> and dry up the <hi>Ulcers,</hi> while the Cauſe remains ſtill in the Body, and after ſuch a fallacious, and barely <hi>palliative</hi> Cure, the Diſeaſe wou'd return with equal or perhaps greater Violence than before: And therefore you muſt endeavour with all poſſible Diligence, to correct the Acrimony of the Humours, deſtroy the Poiſon that cauſes the preternatural Heat, evacuate or extirpate all the Corruption, and fortifie Nature, that ſhe may be in a Condition to execute her wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Functions with Vigour and Alacrity.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the uſual Cuſtom to cure this Diſtemper by applying certain Roots to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, putting Remedies in the Ears, or hanging 'em in Bags at the Mane: But tho' theſe Applications may ſtop the Courſe of the Humours for ſome time, they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incapable of draining the Source of 'em; and ſince the <hi>Farcin</hi> is uſually occaſion'd by corrupt and over-heated Blood, the Horſes that are cur'd by theſe Remedies, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards render'd obnoxious to more dangerous Diſtempers; for this way of Curing the <hi>Farcin</hi> is not unlike to the Method of Curing <hi>Quartan Fevers</hi> with the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> which only fixes the Spirits that cauſe the Diſtemper, without conſuming or evacuating 'em, and the <hi>Fever</hi> certainly returns, if the Ferment or Humour be not expell'd by convenient <hi>Purgatives.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Farcin;</hi> for thoſe <hi>palliative</hi> Remedies perform a ſeeming Cure, but the Corruption and poiſonous Cauſe of the Diſtemper remain, and afterwards degenerate to <hi>Scabs</hi> or <hi>Scratches</hi> on the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news</hi> or <hi>Cronet, Glanders, Purſiveneſs,</hi> and ſeveral other Diſeaſes that are more difficult to be cur'd than the <hi>Farcin</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Others apply <hi>Cauſtic Ointments,</hi> to extirpate the foul and corrupt Fleſh; but tho' I have obſerv'd this Method to be ſometimes ſucceſsful, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew in two Remarkable Inſtances, I cannot be perſwaded to believe that this is the true Cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> ſince it reaches not the Cauſe of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>It requires a ſtronger Faith to believe that a triffing Medicine put into the <hi>Ear,</hi> or hung at the <hi>Mane</hi> is able to root out an inveterate <hi>Farcin,</hi> than that the <hi>Sympathetic Powder</hi> cures Wounds without immediate Application: And ſince there are not many who give Credit to the boaſted Effects of that <hi>Powder,</hi> I know no reaſon why we ſhou'd be oblig'd to believe the more incredible Efficacy of theſe Applications for the <hi>Farcin.</hi> If it be objected, That daily Experience confutes my Opinion, and that Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are frequently cur'd with Bags hung at the <hi>Mane</hi> or <hi>Tail,</hi> and ſuch like Toys; I ſhall not ſcruple to confeſs that I have cur'd ſome Horſes by the ſame Method: But I muſt beg leave to continue ſtill in my former Perſwaſion, That this is not a true Cure, ſince the Cauſe is not remov'd, and the Blood remains ſtill hot and corrupted. 'Tis true, the Humour that fomented the Diſeaſe is diverted, and as it were laid aſleep
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:179659:343"/>for ſome time; but it will quickly take another courſe, and perhaps occaſion greater Diſorders: For the Poyſon is not deſtroy'd, which, beſides the above-mention'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, may breed ſome internal <hi>Abſceſs, Cramps, Gout,</hi> and other Diſtempers, or putrefie and ulcerate the <hi>Lungs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If when the courſe of the Humour is diverted, and a ſtop put to the external ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> by thoſe <hi>palliative</hi> Remedies, due care were taken to attack or deſtroy the venemous cauſe of the Diſeaſe with ſome good <hi>ſpecific</hi> Remedy, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Blood, and powerfully expelling the corrupt Humours, the Cure would certainly ſucceed. But then it muſt be acknowleg'd, that thoſe pretended <hi>ſympathetic</hi> Remedies are altogether uſeleſs, ſince the work is perform'd without their aſſiſtance: For if the noxious Humours be evacuated, and the Blood purify'd, all the ſymptoms of the <hi>Farcin</hi> will diſappear without any other Remedy.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing that promotes the Cure more effectually than <hi>Bleeding</hi> in the beginning of the Diſtemper; for it prevents the corruption of the Blood, by facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and quickening its Circulation, and gives Nature an opportunity to produce new and better Blood in the room of that which is taken away. But you muſt take care not to imitate thoſe Pretenders to Art, who, in my Preſence, have taken ſuch an immoderate quantity of Blood from Horſes troubl'd with the <hi>Farcin,</hi> that they fell into a <hi>Deliquium</hi> or ſwooning Fit. This is the moſt unreaſonable and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Remedy in the World; for by that vaſt expence of Blood, the <hi>natural Heat</hi> is ſo infeebl'd, that it remains incapable of performing its Functions: And Nature is not able in a long time to repair ſo prodigious a havock and waſte of Spirits. 'Tis true indeed, you have taken away part of the corrupt Blood, but then you muſt expect, that the empty'd Veins will be immediately fill'd with all the Seroſities in the Body, and the other Humours that were neceſſary for the preſervation of the Parts in their natural ſtate and conſtitution; and conſequently the mixture of the whole Maſs of Blood will be deprav'd. 'Tis obvious to every Man of Senſe, that the deſtruction of the principle of Life which is lodg'd in the Blood is fatal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; and tho' perhaps you may cure the Horſe of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> you will afterwards be ſenſible, tho' too late, that you have robb'd him of all his Beauty, and render'd him unfit for ſervice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweating</hi> alone wou'd be ſufficient to purifie the Blood; but our uſual Remedies are not ſtrong enough to procure ſuch a plentiful Evacuation as wou'd be neceſſary for the Cure of the Diſtemper. For the beſt <hi>Sudorifics</hi> for <hi>Men</hi> operate very weakly on <hi>Horſes,</hi> or perhaps not at all.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> furniſhes us with ſome Remedies that are found by experience to be of ſufficient efficacy to make Horſes Sweat, and in ſome meaſure to purifie their Blood: But they raiſe ſo great a heat in the Intrails, that 'tis frequently a harder Task to allay that, than to Cure the <hi>Farcin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After you have let a Horſe <hi>Blood,</hi> whatever Method you intend to follow, you may if you pleaſe, adminiſter a <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy to prepare the Horſe's Body, and open Obſtructions: For the Medicines that are afterwards exhibited will purifie the Blood more effectually; tho' after all, <hi>Purgation</hi> is not abſolutely neceſſary. The two following <hi>Purgatives</hi> are of excellent uſe in this caſe, and I have cur'd ſeveral Horſes of a leſs Malignant kind of <hi>Farcin,</hi> with a Doſe of one of theſe Medicines.</p>

After your Horſe has drunk it all up, rinſe the Pot and Horn with half a Pint of Wine, and give it to the Horſe, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Bridl'd ſix Hours before and five Hours after, and feeding him all that Day, and two Days after with <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats;</hi> nor muſt you give him any <hi>Hay</hi> the Day before you adminiſter the Medicine, nor ſo long as the Purgation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
                        <p>If this Remedy do not procure a ſufficient evacuation you may uſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pills.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:179659:343"/>that which operates effectually one time may fruſtrate your Expectations on another occaſion.</p>
                     </div>

                           <hi>Pills for the</hi> Farcin.</head>
                        <p>Take <hi>Sena</hi> Leaves, and Roots of <hi>Hermodactyls,</hi> of each one Ounce, <hi>Agaric</hi> three Drams, <hi>Fine Scammony,</hi> four Drams; <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> one Ounce; <hi>Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Cloves,</hi> of each one Dram; <hi>Fennel-ſeed</hi> and <hi>Ginger,</hi> of each two Scruples.

                        <p>After the <hi>Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purging</hi> there will not be need of any more inward Remedies, only when the <hi>Knots</hi> are ripen'd, you muſt open 'em to give a paſſage to the Matter; and if, inſtead of drying up, the Lips of the Sore remain ſwoll'n, ſtrew 'em once with <hi>Realgar</hi> in fine Powder. After nine Days the Scab will fall off, and leave the Sore fair and clean, which you may afterwards dry up with ſome of the Powders preſcrib'd for the Cure of <hi>Wounds;</hi> for Example, with the Powder of the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> that remains after the diſtillation of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Give your Horſe every Day in <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> an Ounce of the Root of the <hi>hundred headed Thiſtle</hi> in Powder, or two Ounces of the <hi>Green Root.</hi> You muſt gather the Root in the Spring, when the Plant begins to ſhoot forth, dry it in the ſhade, and beat it to Powder. The Root of the <hi>Queen of the Meadows</hi> gather'd at the ſame time, and given in the ſame quantity, is no leſs effectual; for theſe two Roots are the true <hi>ſpecific</hi> Remedies of the <hi>Farcin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis a common Error, that if a plentiful Evacuation be procur'd by any Remedies whatſoever, the Cure will ſucceed: For 'tis certain, that notwithſtanding the effectual operation of the Medicine, if it be not peculiarly adapted to the Diſtemper, the <hi>Farcin</hi> will grow more Malignant; and if it be ſeated on the Thigh the Swelling will increaſe inſtead of diminiſhing. A <hi>Purgative</hi> Remedy that is not endu'd with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Virtue againſt the Diſeaſe, ſtirs the Humours, which it cannot evacuate, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture throws the Load that oppreſſes her upon the weak and ſore Parts, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Swelling is augmented after <hi>Purgation;</hi> but if the Remedy attack the Venom and cauſe of the Diſtemper, the Swelling will be ſenſibly abated; and from thence you may conclude, that the Purgation has produc'd the intended effect.</p>
                        <p>The two above-mention'd Remedies are uſeful for all Horſes that ſtand in need of <hi>Purging,</hi> ſuch as thoſe who are very Fat, or full of Humours, and are not accuſtom'd to Exerciſe.

                     <p>This is the true Method of curing the <hi>Farcin,</hi> by purifying the Blood, deſtroying the Poyſon, and ſtrengthning Nature.</p>

                        <p>The Horſe muſt eat nothing but <hi>Bran,</hi> and may be moderately ridden.

                     </p>
                     <p>To proceed methodically in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, you muſt ſurround the <hi>Knots</hi> with a Line drawn with a hot Iron, without piercing the Skin, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently puts a ſtop to the <hi>Farcin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you perceive that the <hi>Knots</hi> are full of Matter, I mean ſuch as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Suppuration, open 'em boldly with a red-hot Iron whereſoever they are ſeated, not excepting even the <hi>Hough</hi> nor the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> of the <hi>Fore-Leg:</hi> For if you thruſt in your Inſtrument no farther than till it reach the Matter, you can never do the leaſt Injury to the Part, but only aſſiſt Nature to expel what offends her: And the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tumour prevents thoſe Diſorders that might have been occaſion'd if the Matter had been longer retain'd.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you have ſurrounded and ſtop'd the <hi>Cords</hi> and <hi>Knots</hi> with the Raſes of <hi>Fire,</hi> open a Vein, taking away a great quantity of Blood, and give your Horſe a <hi>Purging</hi> Medicine, mixt with <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> or <hi>Cinnabar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If afterwards new <hi>Knots</hi> appear, you muſt let 'em ripen; and if they will not come to Suppuration, burn 'em with a red-hot Iron. When the Scab falls off, if new pieces of Fleſh ſpring up like Muſhrooms, 'tis a certain ſign of the danger of the Diſtemper, and difficulty of the Cure; and the Fleſh muſt be conſum'd, either by a repeated Application of the red-hot Iron, or of one of the following <hi>Cauſtics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you have burnt the Knots or Swellings that come to Suppuration, you muſt waſh 'em every Day, after the Scab is fall'n off, with <hi>Urine,</hi> and dreſs 'em with the <hi>Ointment of Portugal.</hi>

                     <p>Whatever Method you follow in the Cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> you muſt always obſerve the above-mention'd Directions concerning your Horſe's Diet: You muſt alſo Bleed him, and Purge him too, if you think fit; but whether you <hi>purge</hi> or not, you muſt begin with <hi>Bleeding.</hi> Then,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sarſaparilla</hi> and <hi>China</hi>-Roots cut ſmall, of each three Ounces; Roots of <hi>Avens,</hi> two Ounces; Leaves of <hi>Agrimony</hi> two large handfuls, <hi>Scordium</hi> a handful and a half; boil 'em gently in four Quarts of Water, to a Quart and a half in a cover'd Veſſel; then ſtrain, and adding a Pint of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> make a Decoction for five Doſes, to be given five Mornings together, adding to every Doſe an ordinary Glaſs-full of <hi>Urine</hi>

                     <p>THE Humour that foments this Kind of <hi>Farcin</hi> partakes ſo much of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> that the <hi>Knots</hi> are ſeldom or never brought to Suppuration; ſending forth a ſort of foul and <hi>proud</hi> Fleſh that can hardly be curb'd or extirpated by Remedies. The Difficulty of the Cure ought to heighten our Diligence, and convince us of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing the moſt potent Remedies to expel the Cauſe of the Diſtemper, ſuch as theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>Since <hi>black Hellebore</hi> is one of the principal, and moſt effectual Remedies for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, great Care ſhou'd be taken to correct its ill Qualities by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Preparation.</p>
                     <p>Take a ſufficient quantity of the Roots of true <hi>black Hellebore</hi> waſh'd and dry'd; infuſe 'em twenty four Hours in <hi>Vinegar of Roſes,</hi> and throwing away the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> dry the Roots at a very gentle Fire.</p>

                        <p>Take <hi>Sena</hi> Leaves and <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> of each an Ounce; <hi>Turbith, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius dulcis,</hi> of each half an Ounce; <hi>black Hellebore</hi> prepar'd, three Drams; <hi>Rhubarb</hi> two Drams, <hi>Ginger</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> of each a Dram and a half; <hi>Anniſeed</hi> and <hi>Fennelſeed,</hi> of each half a Dram: Beat all the Ingredients to a groſs Powder, and with a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter</hi> make 'em up into Pills; keep your Horſe bridl'd ſix Hours before, and as long after, and aſſoon as he has taken the <hi>Pills</hi> walk him gently for the ſpace of half an Hour well cover'd. <hi>Note,</hi> That you muſt bleed your Horſe the day before you give him the Pills.</p>
                        <p>You may purge a Horſe for the <hi>Farcin</hi> with two Ounces of the <hi>Catholic</hi> or <hi>Imperial</hi> Pills of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> mix'd with half an Ounce of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> made up into one or two Pills, and exhibited in a Pint of White-Wine.

                     <head>CHAP. CXLV. <hi>The</hi> German Ptiſan, <hi>for the Cure of the</hi> Farcin.</head>
                     <p>TAke the dry Roots of <hi>Angelica, Gentian, Valerian, Avens, round Birthwort</hi> and <hi>Marſh-Mallows,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half, or a double quantity of the <hi>green Roots;</hi> Leaves of <hi>Agrimony</hi> two Handfuls. Beat the Roots groſsly, boil all the Ingredients in a cloſe-cover'd Pot, in three Quarts of Water, to the Conſumption of one half: Then preſs out the Liquor thro' a Linnen-Cloth, and add to the Straining before it grow cold, half an Ounce of <hi>Juice of Liquorice,</hi> and <hi>White Wine</hi> an equal quantity to the whole Decoction, and afterwards add two Pugils of <hi>Oriental Saffron</hi> in Powder.</p>
                     <p>Three Days after the <hi>Purgation,</hi> when the Evacuation is over, and the Horſe's Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite reſtor'd, let him ſtand bridl'd from Five a Clock in the Morning to Eight, then give him the fifth Part of the Decoction, keeping him bridl'd three Hours after. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Decoction after the ſame Manner for five Days together.</p>
                     <p>If his Appetite be not fully reſtor'd in the limited time after the Purgation, you muſt wait four, five, or ſix Days, till you are convinc'd that he feeds as heartily as he did before you gave him the purging Medicine. During the time of his taking the Decoction, if the Weather be not too hot, walk him gently half an Hour every Day after Dinner. Theſe five Doſes of the Decoction, are uſually ſufficient for perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cure, without any other Remedy; and the <hi>Cords, Knots,</hi> and Tumours are heal'd and dry'd up.</p>
                     <p>Moderate Exerciſe is convenient in the beginning; but afterwards you may travel him as if he were perfectly ſound.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive new <hi>Knots</hi> to ariſe at the firſt <hi>New Moon,</hi> you may conclude that the Diſeaſe is not perfectly extirpated; and therefore you muſt prepare and exhibit the <hi>Ptiſan,</hi> as before, but without <hi>Bleeding</hi> or <hi>Purging.</hi> If the Tumours break forth again, the Caſe is altogether deſperate; for it has been frequently obſerv'd, that when the <hi>Farcin</hi> is inveterate, and has long reſiſted the Efficacy of the beſt Remedies, eſpecially when corrupt Fleſh breaks out of the Tumours inſtead of Matter, that the Malignity of the burnt and corrupted Blood has ſo heated the Subſtance of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> that there are Ulcers generated in ſeveral parts of 'em: And therefore ſince 'tis impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a conſum'd Part, thoſe Ulcers that waſte the <hi>Lungs</hi> are the infallible Meſſengers of Death. The Truth of this Obſervation is confirm'd beyond Contradiction, by the Diffections of thoſe Horſes that die of the <hi>Farcin;</hi> for their <hi>Lungs</hi> are almoſt always found to be corrupted and putrefy'd, and ſometimes the <hi>Liver</hi> is over-ſpread with Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and part of it waſted and turn'd to Putrefaction. Now I wou'd willingly know of thoſe confident Pretenders to infallible Secrets for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> whether their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are able to reſtore a rotten and waſted <hi>Liver?</hi> If not, 'tis in vain to expect the Horſe's Recovery, for the putrefy'd <hi>Liver</hi> will ſtill continue to vitiate the Blood, and hinder the Cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> which is occaſion'd by the Corruption of the Blood. How ridiculouſly do thoſe Boaſters betray their Ignorance for want of Experience! Since all that the moſt skilful and expert Farrier can promiſe in this Caſe is, That he will cure the <hi>Farcin</hi> if it be curable; for ſometimes the <hi>Liver</hi> is ulcerated at the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Diſtemper, and is the very Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, in which Caſe 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly incurable: And I have already intimated that an inveterate <hi>Farcin</hi> may infect and waſte the Subſtance of the <hi>Lungs.</hi> And how a Remedy apply'd to the <hi>Fore-head,</hi> put into the <hi>Ear,</hi> hung at the <hi>Tail</hi> or <hi>Mane,</hi> or Ointments ſpread on the <hi>Knots,</hi> can heal an Ulcer in the <hi>Lungs,</hi> I confeſs is very much above my Capacity to comprehend: Only thus much I know, and dare confidently maintain, That ſo long as thoſe Ulcers remain, the <hi>Farcin</hi> that is caus'd and fomented by 'em muſt neceſſarily ſubſiſt. From what has been ſaid I may reaſonably conclude, That thoſe <hi>Infallible Gentlemen</hi> are very little acquainted with the Nature of the Diſeaſe they pretend to cure, and perhaps never made an Experiment of the Virtue of their Remedies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Farcin</hi> ſeems to have a very near Reſemblance to the <hi>French Pox, Leproſie,</hi> and <hi>King's Evil.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXLVI. <hi>Of an</hi> inveterate Farcin.</head>
                     <p>YOU will ſometimes meet with <hi>Farcins</hi> of ſo long a ſtanding, and ſo deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Cure is extremely difficult, and even ſometimes impracticable, if the Subſtance of the <hi>Liver</hi> or <hi>Lungs</hi> be waſted, and corrupted. But ſince 'tis impoſſible to divine whether thoſe Parts be infected; 'twou'd be a very unreaſonable Inference from what I have ſaid on this Subject, to pretend that when a Horſe is troubl'd with an <hi>inveterate Farcin,</hi> he muſt be ſuffer'd to periſh without Aſſiſtance. And beſides theſe Parts are oftentimes only heated, dryed, or ſo ſlightly ulcerated, that they may be eaſily heal'd, and reſtor'd to their wonted Temperament, by the Uſe of convenient Remedies. But I ſhall never adviſe any Man, whatever Tryal he may have made of his Remedy, to promiſe the Cure of an inveterate <hi>Farcin,</hi> when the <hi>Knots</hi> ſend forth great Pieces of Fleſh like large <hi>Muſhrooms;</hi> eſpecially after an unſucceſsful Application of other Remedies. For ſuch Attempts are oftentimes attended with Shame inſtead of Honour and Succeſs; eſpecially when the <hi>Farcin</hi> is accompany'd with a <hi>Running at the Noſe,</hi> or ſeizes on the <hi>Kernels,</hi> as it happens frequently in <hi>inveterate Farcins,</hi> which degenerate into the <hi>Glanders,</hi> according to the Vulgar Saying, That the <hi>Farcin is Couſin-German to the Glanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before you proceed to the Application of Remedies, you may try this eaſie Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Spread about two Ounces of <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> on a Stick, and wrapping a Cloth about it, put it into the Horſe's Mouth, and make him champ upon it twenty four Hours together, without ſuffering him to eat or drink all the while. This will draw forth a prodigious Quantity of filthy Humours; and if the <hi>Lungs</hi> be not conſum'd, or the <hi>Liver</hi> ulcerated, perhaps the Horſe will recover. You muſt not be afraid of the ſeeming Violence of the Remedy, for a Horſe may faſt twenty four Hours without any Danger: Neither do I blame the Cuſtom of thoſe, who put a ſecond Stick with freſh <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> into the Horſe's Mouth, after twelve Hours.</p>
                     <p>The Decoctions of <hi>Guaiacum, Saſſafras, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and <hi>China</hi> Roots, are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on this Occaſion; and may be given every Morning, for ſeven or eight Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Purgation.</p>
                     <p>For Example; If the Horſe's Body be full of raw, tough, and viſcous Humours, to which Inconveniency fleſhy Horſes are very ſubject; the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> will cut, attenuate, and prepare the Humours, to be expell'd by Nature, or evacuated by a Purging Remedy.</p>
                     <p>If the Horſe be Lean and Dry, full of Hot and <hi>Choleric,</hi> or <hi>Melancholic</hi> Humours, the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>China</hi> will prepare 'em, without augmenting their Heat; for it may be conveniently given in a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and <hi>ill Habit of Body.</hi> The <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla</hi> is of a middle Nature between the other two.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> is proper for thoſe thick and bulky <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſes, that are over-loaded with Fleſh, and full of Moiſture, and running or watery Sores.</p>

                        <p>Take four Ounces of the Roots of <hi>China</hi> cut very ſmall, put 'em into a large Glaſs-Bottle well ſtopp'd, with nine Pints of Water; and after they have ſtood fifteen Hours in Infuſion, boil 'em over a gentle Fire to the Conſumption of one half, taking care to prevent the Evaporation of the thinner Parts of the Medicine: Then ſtrain out the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:179659:347"/>Liquor, and give your Horſe a third part of it every Morning, keeping him Bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after.</p>
                        <p>This Decoction muſt be drunk luke-warm, and prepar'd every three Days, becauſe 'tis apt to turn ſowre. After eight Doſes 'twill be convenient to exhibit a <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy.</p>

                        <p>This Decoction is prepar'd like that of <hi>China,</hi> only the quantity muſt be larger, becauſe 'tis adapted for the Preparation of thicker Humours: For Example, inſtead of <hi>four</hi> Ounces of <hi>China,</hi> you muſt take <hi>ſix</hi> of <hi>Sarſaparilla.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Continue the uſe of this Decoction ſix or eight Days, to prepare the Humours that cauſe and foment the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and to purifie the Blood.</p>
                        <p>After ſuch a <hi>Preparation</hi> the <hi>Purging</hi> Remedy operates more effectually, and procures a more plentiful Evacuation: whereas the <hi>Purgatives</hi> that are given without any <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> or conſiſt of ill choſen Ingredients, increaſe the Diſtemper inſtead of abating it, and even augment its Malignity.</p>
                        <p>After <hi>Purgation</hi> repeat the Decoctions, to dry the habit of the Body, and to drain the ſource of thoſe Malignant Humours that foment the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>This Method is alſo very proper for <hi>Coach-Horſes</hi> that are troubl'd with the <hi>Pains,</hi> or filthy <hi>Sores</hi> in their Legs; for otherwiſe 'tis hardly poſſible to ſtop the courſe of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and dry up the ſource of thoſe noiſome Ulcers, ſince they uſually break forth again three Months after they are dry'd up, and at laſt are ſucceeded by hard Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, like <hi>Warts,</hi> which render the Diſeaſe incurable. To prevent thoſe dangerous Relapſes, while your Horſe is Young, after you have obſerv'd twice or thrice his Legs to be over-run with Sores, you muſt take two Pound of Blood from him, then give him the Decoctions of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> or for want of that, of <hi>Box</hi>-Wood; and afterwards purge him, and dry up thoſe watry Humours. If the Sores break forth again, make him drink the Decoction ten Days, then purge him, and after the Evacuation is ceas'd, and his Appetite perfectly reſtor'd, give him the Decoction for ten Days longer, which in all probability will put a final ſtop to the courſe of the Humours. Inſtead of the Decoctions of <hi>Guaiacum, China,</hi> and <hi>Sarſaparilla,</hi> you may exhibit two Ounces of the Powder of either of the three in a Quart of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> and obſerve the ſame Directions both as to the time and manner of giving it, that were preſcrib'd for the uſe of the Decoctions: Theſe <hi>Powders</hi> are not altogether ſo effectual as the <hi>Decoctions,</hi> eſpecially that of <hi>China,</hi> for lean, dry, and choleric Horſes: Yet they are not to be deſpis'd, ſince they alſo produce a conſiderable effect, eſpecially the <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras.</hi>

                     <p>Bridle your Horſe at Midnight, and at ſix a Clock in the Morning, without taking out his Bridle, drop a little of the Mixture into his <hi>Ear,</hi> rubbing it very hard to make the Liquor ſink; after which pour in more Liquor, and rub it in as before, continuing after the ſame manner till you have conſum'd one half of the quantity preſcrib'd; then ſtop the <hi>Ear</hi> with part of the maſh or bruis'd <hi>Wormwood,</hi> out of which you ſqueez'd the <hi>Juice,</hi> and tye it up ſo cloſe, that there may be no paſſage for the Air to get into it.

                     <p>This <hi>Receipt</hi> is particularly adapted to the <hi>Farcin</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> and cures alſo that which appears on the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> being ſeated on the inſide of the Skin, without ſticking to the Body. Sometimes it cures the <hi>Farcin</hi> in the <hi>hinder Parts;</hi> but ſince I have apply'd it to ſome Horſes in that caſe without Succeſs, I can only recommend it as a certain Remedy for the <hi>Farcin</hi> in the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders,</hi> without pretending to warrant its efficacy when the Diſtemper infects the reſt of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The main inconveniency of this <hi>Receipt</hi> is, that there remains always a white mark on each <hi>Ear</hi> where the String was ty'd. Some endeavour to avoid that deformity, by ſowing the <hi>Ears</hi> lengthways; but I have ſeen ſome Horſes Ears ſo notch'd and peel'd by that Method, that the blemiſh was a great deal more unſeemly, than that which is uſually occaſion'd by the Ligature. Thoſe Marks are not viſible on white Horſes.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive foul or corrupt Fleſh in any of the <hi>Knots,</hi> or if the Tumours be large and continue long without breaking, you muſt open 'em with a Lancet when they are fully ripen'd, and afterwards dreſs 'em every Day with the <hi>Ointment of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> till they be dry'd up.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CXLVIII. <hi>To diſſolve and aſſwage all ſorts of</hi> Swellings <hi>caus'd by the</hi> Farcin, <hi>both in the</hi> Legs, <hi>and other Parts of the</hi> Body.</head>
                     <p>SOmetimes after the cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> the <hi>Thigh, Hough,</hi> or <hi>Leg,</hi> and not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently all the three remain ſwoll'n and <hi>gourded.</hi> This inconveniency is the effect of the Careleſneſs of thoſe to whom the management of the Cure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, who neglect to apply a diſſolving Medicine in the beginning, which wou'd have prevented the congealing and hardening of the Humours; for at the firſt you may expect a more conſiderable effect from the weakeſt Remedy, than afterwards from the moſt powerful <hi>Reſolvent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Swellings may be reckon'd among the worſt Infirmities of a Horſe: For the ſwoll'n Leg is bigger, heavier, and more unweildy than the reſt; the Horſe is apt to Stumble, and Tires ſooner than otherwiſe he wou'd have done; and when you have occaſion to ſell him, you muſt part with him for a fourth part of his Value.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very difficult, and oftentimes impoſſible to aſſwage the Swelling of a Leg that has been fear'd or burnt; for the Skin is harden'd, and that which the <hi>Fire</hi> cou'd not diſſolve is ſo hard and congeal'd, that the Application of the beſt Medicines produces a very inconſiderable effect, and frequently none at all.</p>
                     <p>The following <hi>Ointment</hi> diſſolves Swellings of what kind ſoever, whether proceeding from the <hi>Farcin,</hi> or any other cauſe; and if the Tumour yield not to this Medicine, you may conclude, that 'tis above the power of Remedies to perform the Cure.</p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:179659:348"/>
                     <p>Take common <hi>Honey,</hi> and the <hi>Greaſe</hi> of a <hi>Capon, Chicken,</hi> or <hi>Hen,</hi> or if neither of theſe can be procur'd, of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> or for want of that of a <hi>Bore,</hi> melted and ſtrain'd thro' a Linnen-Cloth. Leaves of <hi>Rue</hi> three Pounds, beat 'em in a Marble-Mortar, and incorporate 'em with the <hi>Greaſe</hi> and <hi>Honey.</hi> Then boil this Maſh with a Pint of the <hi>Juice of green Coleworts</hi> in a Skillet or Baſon over a gentle Fire, ſtirring perpetually, for the ſpace of half an Hour; after which preſs it thro' a Linnen-Cloth, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the groſs Subſtance that remains in the Cloth, boil the Straining with two Pounds of freſh <hi>Rue,</hi> if the Herbs be dry: Then ſtrain it into a new Pot, and after 'tis cold, add <hi>Cinnabar, Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and <hi>Gum-Ammoniac,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Black-Soap,</hi> one Pound; mix and incorporate the whole; and keep the <hi>Ointment</hi> cloſe cover'd for uſe.</p>
                     <p>Diſſolve an Ounce of <hi>Camphire</hi> beaten to Powder, in a Pint of highly rectify'd <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> by a cold Infuſion, and keep the Solution in a Bottle. The <hi>Camphire</hi> hinders the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> from exhaling, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> retains the <hi>Camphire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you have occaſion to diſſolve any cold Tumour, rub the Part till it grow hot, then chafe it with the <hi>Camphorated Spirit of Wine,</hi> and anoint it with the following Ointment. The next Day, without waſhing away, or taking off the Ointment that remains upon the Part, chafe it with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and afterwards with the <hi>Ointment,</hi> continuing after the ſame manner till the Swelling be aſſwag'd.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ointment</hi> alone is ſufficient for the Cure of the <hi>Water-Farcin,</hi> or other ſofter Swellings.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe's Legs are ſwoll'n with the <hi>Farcin,</hi> even during the Application of other Remedies, for the Cure of the main Diſeaſe, you muſt chafe the ſwoll'n Leg with this <hi>Ointment</hi> once every Day, walking the Horſe to make the Medicine ſink in, and continuing after the ſame manner till the Leg be ſound.</p>
                     <p>While you are endeavouring to draw out the Humour that cauſes the <hi>Cord,</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing it with the <hi>Ointment of Beetles;</hi> you may at the ſame time apply the <hi>diſſolving Ointment</hi> to the other ſwoll'n parts of the Leg.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Tumours appear under the <hi>Chaul,</hi> and at the ſides of it, on the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and in other parts of the Body. If you perceive that theſe Tumours are neither oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the <hi>Strangles,</hi> nor have the leaſt tendency to Suppuration, apply this Ointment cold till the Swellings be aſſwag'd.</p>
                     <p>The following Ointment is ſufficient for the Cure of ſmall and inconſiderable Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Take the <hi>Ointment of Marſh-Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Populeon,</hi> of each two Ounces; <hi>Black-Soap,</hi> four Ounces; and with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Brandy</hi> make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Ointment will alſo aſſwage thoſe Swellings that are only faſten'd to the Skin, and remain after the Cure of Wounds or Hurts that are not brought to a due Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, eſpecially on the <hi>Withers:</hi> But 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Cure will ſucceed the better, if you apply the Ointment as ſoon as you perceive the Swelling.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes after the Cure of Swellings in the <hi>Legs</hi> or <hi>Houghs</hi> by Blows or Bruiſes, or other ſuch like Accidents, the <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> continue gourded by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd and harden'd Humour, tho' the Horſe ſeem not to be troubl'd with any Pain or Lameneſs. This Deformity may be eaſily corrected by moderate Exerciſe, and the daily Application of the Ointment to the ſwoll'n Part: But if it be not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the expected Succeſs, after you have renew'd the Application five or ſix times without any viſible abatement of the Swelling; you muſt waſh the Part with a ſtrong <hi>Lye</hi> twice a Day, for five or ſix Days, and then apply the <hi>Spirit of Wine Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorated,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>diſſolving Ointment;</hi> for there are few Swellings ſo inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, that may not be aſſwag'd by this Method.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive that the Ointment is too ſtrong, and that it raiſes Bliſters and Scabs, or ſwells the Part, add a convenient quantity of <hi>Capon</hi>'s, or <hi>Horſe</hi>'s <hi>Greaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes you may meet with inveterate Swellings, that elude the force of all thoſe Remedies, eſpecially in Winter, by reaſon of the Cold which condenſes the Pores and makes the Cure extreamly difficult; and therefore you muſt double the quantity of the Remedies. But if the Succeſs, after all, do not anſwer your Expectations, you muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> very dexterouſly, without piercing the Skin. <hi>Note,</hi> That in this caſe, you muſt not apply a Plaiſter, but only chafe the burnt Parts with a Mixture of <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> for the ſpace of nine Days, and then with <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> alone, till the Scab fall away, and the Sore be dry.</p>
                     <p>Since <hi>Fire</hi> is the moſt powerful <hi>Reſolvent,</hi> it oftentimes performs Cures that have been in vain attempted with the beſt <hi>Ointments;</hi> but it operates ſlowly, and you muſt often wait three Months before you can perceive any conſiderable effect of it.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:179659:349"/>You may <hi>give the Fire</hi> ſafely in any part of the Body, even on the <hi>Sinews, Tendons,</hi> and <hi>Veins;</hi> for it never produces any ill effect, if the hot Iron be nimbly and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly apply'd without piercing the Skin; and if thoſe Cautions be obſerv'd, it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves any viſible Mark.</p>
                     <p>I could have added many other <hi>Receipts</hi> for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> if I had not reſolv'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert none but ſuch as I have often try'd with Succeſs; among which I may juſtly reckon the two that follow.</p>

                        <p>The Perſon who communicated this Receipt was ſo confident of its Virtue, and pretended that he had perform'd ſo many wonderful and unexpected Cures with it, that he uſually bought all the Horſes that were troubl'd with the <hi>Farcin,</hi> which he cou'd purchaſe at a low rate. But the Obſervations I made on the Condition of ſome of thoſe Horſes when he began to apply the Remedy, makes me inclinable to think that his Attempts were not always attended with Succeſs. Take a Root of <hi>ſharp-pointed Dock,</hi> two Fingers breadth long, and about the thickneſs of one; Split it thro' the middle, and having made an Inciſion in the Fore-head croſs-wiſe, ſeparate the Skin with a <hi>Hazel</hi>-ſtick, and put in the Root, laying over it a Plaiſter of <hi>Black-Pitch,</hi> and ſuffering it to ſtick till it fall of it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Take the Leaves and Roots of <hi>ſharp-pointed Dock</hi> and <hi>Dandelion,</hi> gather'd in the Summer, of each an equal quantity; having waſh'd and dry'd 'em, beat 'em in a Mortar, with a Pugil of common <hi>Salt,</hi> and make up the Maſh into <hi>Balls,</hi> of the bigneſs of a <hi>Walnut</hi> to be put into each <hi>Ear.</hi> Then bind the Ears very hard, for twenty four Hours, after which cut the Ligature, and waſh the <hi>Farcin-Knots</hi> with the following Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Infuſe a large quantity of the <hi>Ruſtieſt Iron</hi> you can find in two Quarts of the <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> for twenty four Hours: Then take out the <hi>Iron,</hi> and ſcraping off all the <hi>Ruſt,</hi> put it again into the <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> with a handful of the <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Roch-Allom,</hi> and the like quantity of <hi>Bay-Salt,</hi> and adding a Pint, or a Pint and a half of Water, boil away two thirds of the Liquor: Rub the <hi>Knots</hi> with a piece of new and coarſe Linnen-Clo th, dipt in this Liquor, till they be raw, and begin to Bleed.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Farcin</hi> be in the <hi>Thighs</hi> or <hi>Legs,</hi> bathe 'em with this Liquor, and wrap 'em about with Linnen-Clouts dipt in the ſame. If the Parts be ſwoll'n or gourded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Application once every three Days.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Knots</hi> begin to be a little Mortify'd, ſtrew 'em with the Powder of green <hi>Copperas</hi> Calcin'd.</p>

                     <p>MAny Perſons take this Diſtemper for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and put themſelves to needleſs Trouble and Charge for the Cure of it. 'Tis occaſion'd by a Redundancy of Blood, over-heated by ſeveral Accidents and other Cauſes, already mention'd. For the thinneſt and moſt ſubtil part of the Blood penetrating the Subſtance of the Fleſh, cauſes external Tumours reſembling the <hi>Farcin:</hi> And long Reſt and want of Exerciſe are uſually the occaſional Cauſes of this Diſtemper, by hindering the Diſſipation of ſuperfluous Humours.</p>
                     <p>You may eaſily cure this Diſtemper, by <hi>Bleeding</hi> your Horſe plentifully once or twice in the <hi>Neck-Veins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Tumours are diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Farcin,</hi> both by the ſuddenneſs of their Appearance, and of the Cure; for ſometimes they overſpread the Body in one Night: And beſides, they are neither hard, nor faſten'd to the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Swellings are oftentimes repell'd and driven inwards by unſeaſonable Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Horſe is ſeiz'd with a Fever; in which Caſe you muſt immediately give him a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and an Hour after an Ounce or two of <hi>Treacle,</hi> or <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> in Wine; which by driving out the Humour, will give Eaſe to the Horſe, and at laſt cure him.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes are troubl'd from time to time with little <hi>Knots</hi> or <hi>Bunches</hi> in ſeveral parts of their Body, occaſion'd by the Boiling, or rather exceſſive Heat of their Blood; for the moſt ſubtle and choleric Particles being driven outwards to the external Parts of the Body form theſe little Tumours, part of which break and diſappear, and the reſt are diſſolv'd by inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>The general and moſt effectual way to cure all theſe Ebullitions, is to mix with your Horſe's Bread thoſe Remedies that are endu'd with a Virtue to cool and purifie the Blood. Thus <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> given to the quantity of an Ounce and a half every Day, will ſafely and quickly diſſolve all thoſe Knots, and ſweeten your Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe's Blood. Three or four Doſes of the <hi>Cinnabar-Pills</hi> are alſo very effectual in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>You may prevent this Diſtemper, by giving your Horſe <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> in his <hi>Bran,</hi> which will expel thoſe Bilious Seroſities that uſually cauſe theſe Symptoms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps drive 'em out by the Urinary Paſſages. The ſame Remedy allays the Heat of the Blood and Intrails, and prevents the <hi>Farcin,</hi> and other Diſtempers occaſion'd by the Heat of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>For the Satisfaction of the Curious, I ſhall inſert the Preparation of <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> which is a very uſeful Medicine both for Men and Horſes.</p>

                     <p>THis is only <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> fix'd with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to prevent its Solution.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> of the <hi>fourth Solution,</hi> melt it in a Crucible or Iron Pot, and when you perceive that 'tis entirely reduc'd to a liquid Form, throw a little <hi>Brimſtone</hi> upon it. Aſſoon as the Flame ceaſes, caſt ſome more <hi>Brimſtone</hi> into the Crucible, continuing after the ſame manner, till you have thrown in an Ounce of Flower of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> for every Pound of <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> which muſt be kept in Fuſion during the whole Operation. Then take out the <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> with an Iron Spoon, and put it into a little Copper Baſon, which being plac'd in a Pailful of cold Water, the Mineral will congeal at the Bottom, and appear as white as Snow. An <hi>Iron Pot</hi> is more fit for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:179659:350"/>this Operation than Crucibles, which are uſually pierc'd and crack'd with the <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> unleſs you can procure a good <hi>German</hi> Crucible.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding of a Paſſage, in the Beginning of the preceding De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, it will not be amiſs to acquaint the Reader, that <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> is found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd into Chryſtals in the Water which is pour'd for that purpoſe, on <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Plaiſter</hi> taken from the Ruines of old Buildings, and mixt with Aſhes. This Water is afterwards boil'd till a Scum appear on the Top, and then ſet in a cold place in Woodden Veſſels; where Chryſtals of a long Figure, and ruſty Colour are form'd, which is <hi>Salt-Petre of the firſt Solution.</hi> Then diſſolve theſe Chryſtals in clean Water, ſtrain it thro' a Woollen Cloth, boil it as before, and when 'tis cold the <hi>Salt-Petre of the ſecond Solution</hi> will appear in Chryſtals, which are proper for the making of <hi>Gun-Powder, Liver of Antimony,</hi> and ſeveral other Preparations: For if the <hi>Nitre</hi> were too fine and violent, it wou'd carry off part of the <hi>Antimony</hi> that is mixt with it. If you wou'd have your <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> more pure and refin'd, diſſolve it in Water, filtrate, boil, and chryſtallize as before, to procure <hi>Salt-Petre of the third Solution;</hi> repeating the ſame Operation as often as you think fit, for if the <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> be not very pure, 'tis impoſſible to make fine <hi>Sal Prunellae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſtal Mineral</hi> is not only fix'd by the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but purg'd of thoſe <hi>Arſenical</hi> Spirits of which it was full; ſo that 'tis entirely freed of all Sharpneſs and Malignity. It purifies and cools the Blood and Intrails, allays and ſtops the Ebullition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in Fevers, powerfully opens all Obſtructions, opens and incides the Body of Medicines, that their Virtues may be the better extracted, and in one Word, 'tis a very cooling Remedy without Acrimony or Biting.</p>
                     <p>You may give an Ounce and a half of it every Day in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> mixt with half an Ounce of <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> beaten, or diſſolve three or four Ounces of it in a Pailful of Water for your Horſe's ordinary Drink; and it may be alſo conveniently mix'd with purging Medicines. Every Author extols the Virtues of this Remedy; but I have only inſiſted on its Uſefulneſs for Horſes.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Cooling</hi> a Medicine ought to be cautiouſly adminiſter'd to <hi>Horſes,</hi> whoſe Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is different from that of Men: And therefore when you give it in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> 'twill be convenient to add half an Ounce of <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> beaten, to qualifie and correct the extreme Coldneſs of the Remedy; which notwithſtanding its great Uſefulneſs in other Reſpects, oftentimes deſtroys the Horſe's Appetite, and makes his Hair ſtare: But ſome Horſes have the Advantage of ſuch ſtrong Appetites, that the Uſe of this Medicine, tho' adminiſter'd alone, produces not the leaſt ill Effect upon their Stomachs: And I have made ſome Horſes eat three or four Pounds of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſordering their Stomachs, or making 'em forſake their Meat.</p>

                     <p>THE Heat that occaſions theſe Diſorders is not always an Effect of Diſtempers in the Intrails, but ſometimes proceeds from a Corruption of the Humours, and is the more dangerous becauſe it may degenerate into a <hi>Fever.</hi> The remote Cauſes of this Heat are immoderate and violent Exerciſe, too hot Nouriſhment, ſuch as <hi>Clover, Beans,</hi> &amp;c.

This Diſtemper ſometimes precedes a <hi>Cough.</hi> The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remedy is very effectual in this Caſe, and generally uſeful for all over-heated Horſes.</p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:179659:350"/>
                     <p>In the firſt place you may give your Horſe the <hi>Cinnabar-Pills,</hi> obſerving the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Directions: But if thoſe prove ineffectual, prepare the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
                     <p>Put half a Pound of <hi>calcin'd Roch-Allom</hi> into a <hi>Matraſs</hi> or long-neckt Vial, with a Quart of <hi>diſtill'd Vinegar;</hi> digeſt on hot Aſhes till the <hi>Allom</hi> be diſſolv'd, after which ſtrain the Vinegar thro' a double Cloth or brown Paper: Then boil away the third Part in an Earthen Pot, and afterwards ſet it in a cool Cellar, where it will congeal into Cryſtals about the Sides of the Pot. Pour off the remaining Vinegar, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving evaporated one half, ſet it in a Cellar to <hi>cryſtallize</hi> as before: Then mix theſe Cryſtals with the former, and dry 'em carefully.</p>
                     <p>When you have occaſion to cool your Horſe's Body, take theſe Cryſtals of <hi>Allom, Sal Prunellae,</hi> and <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi> of each half an Ounce; beat 'em to Powder, and having infus'd 'em in a Quart of White Wine during the ſpace of a Night, make your Horſe drink the Infuſion in the Morning, keeping him bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after. Continue after the ſame Manner, unleſs the Horſe forſake his Meat; for in that Caſe you muſt diſcontinue the Uſe of the Remedy, and even lay it aſide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, if you perceive that his Appetite is quite loſt, and his Hair begins to ſtare: For theſe are evident Signs, that he ſtands not in need of <hi>cooling</hi> Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The beſt way to <hi>cool</hi> or refreſh the Body of a Horſe, when his Stomach is injur'd by the above-mention'd Remedy, is to purifie his Blood with the <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> or ſome other convenient Medicine.</p>
                     <p>I might take this Occaſion to confute the vulgar Miſtakes concerning the Method of adminiſtring cooling Medicines to Horſes; but to avoid Repetitions, I ſhall content my ſelf with referring the Reader to what has been already ſaid on that Subject, and conclude this Chapter with the Caſe of a Horſe that without the leaſt Appearance of a Scab, was tormented with a violent and almoſt incredible <hi>Itching</hi> in his Hide. I order'd him to be let Blood twice, and made him eat above ſix Pounds of <hi>Polychreſt</hi> in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> giving him a Handful every Day without weighing the Doſes. His Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach was not in the leaſt diſorder'd; but he had ſo great a Looſeneſs for twenty Days, that his Excrements were as liquid as Cows Dung. In the mean time I continu'd the Uſe of the <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> till his Dung was reduc'd to its natural Thickneſs; after which he was bath'd in a River, and the <hi>Mange</hi> was cur'd without any external Application.</p>

                     <p>'TIS the general Opinion of <hi>Farriers,</hi> and conſequently of moſt other Men, who believe that their Authority has the Force of an Argument in a Caſe relating to the Art they profeſs; that this Diſtemper, is occaſion'd by violent Exerciſe, which over-heats the Horſe to ſuch a degree, that his Fat (which they alſo ſuppoſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant) is melted in his Body, and ſtifles him: But this is a very ill-grounded <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis;</hi> for if you conſider attentively the Cauſes and Symptoms of this Diſeaſe, you will find your ſelf oblig'd to conclude, that it proceeds from tough and ſlimy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, agitated and fermented by a ſharp and ſubtle ſort of <hi>Choler,</hi> ſo that being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rarefy'd, they break out of the Places where they were lodg'd by Nature; and over-running the whole Body, (according to the Operation of <hi>Leven</hi> upon <hi>Bread</hi>) ferment the reſt of the Humours, which being agitated, and put into Motion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Nature, emit Vapours that diſturb the Brain, excite a Fever, by reaſon of the violent Agitation of the Spirits, and at laſt, by a provident ſtruggle of Nature, in order to the final Evacuation of (at leaſt) part of thoſe Humours that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her, they are driven into the great Gut; where they are mix'd with the Dung, and give us occaſion to judge that the Horſe is troubl'd with the Diſeaſe commonly call'd <hi>Molten-Greaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fat Horſes are moſt ſubject to this Diſtemper, which is uſually occaſion'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion or Fulneſs: For the <hi>Choler</hi> being agitated by violent Exerciſe, and meeting with a Body full of Humours, produces the above-mention'd Diſorders.</p>

                     <p>'Tis a very hard Task to <hi>know,</hi> but more difficult to <hi>cure</hi> this Diſtemper; I ſaw a Horſe that di'd after two Days Illneſs, without giving the leaſt Sign to help us to the Knowledge of his Diſeaſe. 'Tis true, if the Horſe be ſuffer'd to reſt after his Greaſe is molten, the Symptom will be more apparent.</p>
                     <p>The ſick Horſe uſually forſakes his Meat, lies down and riſes again ſuddenly, and looks, upon his <hi>Flanks;</hi> but the ſureſt way to diſcover the Nature of the Diſeaſe, is by putting your Hand into his <hi>Fundament;</hi> for if the Excrements you draw forth, be cover'd with a whitiſh Membrane or Film, in ſome meaſure reſembling Greaſe, you may certainly conclude that his <hi>Greaſe is molten,</hi> and proceed immediately to the Application of convenient Remedies. I attempted and ſucceſsfully perform'd the Cure of a Horſe who was troubl'd with this Diſtemper in ſo violent a Degree, that the ſlimy Humour he voided after the Injection of a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> continu'd to boil and ferment on the Floor, for a very conſiderable time.</p>

                        <p>Aſſoon as you perceive the leaſt Cauſe to ſuſpect that your Horſe's <hi>Greaſe</hi> is <hi>molten,</hi> anoint your Hand and Arm with <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> and put it into his <hi>Fundament,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth not only the <hi>Dung,</hi> but all the <hi>ſlimy</hi> Humours. After you have <hi>rak'd</hi> him carefully, let him blood in the Neck, and half an Hour after give him a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> made by diſſolving two Ounces of <hi>Benedicta Laxativa,</hi> one Ounce of <hi>Sal Gemmae,</hi> or <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> or the <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony,</hi> and a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Honey of Violets,</hi> in two Quarts of the common Decoction, adding <hi>Emetic Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Urine</hi> of a ſound Man, of each a Pint. Then walk your Horſe gently for half an Hour, to provoke him to void the <hi>Clyſter.</hi> When the <hi>Clyſter</hi> leaves off Working, that is about an Hour after the injecting of it, give him about half a Pint of the Juice of <hi>Houſleek,</hi> (which is a Herb that grows on the Walls, and reſembles little <hi>Artichoaks</hi>) mixt with a Pint of <hi>White Wine,</hi> walking him gently for the ſpace of an Hour. This Juice ſtops the Ebullition of the Humours, allays the Heat of the inward Parts, and both cleanſes and heals the Body if it be ſeaſonably adminiſter'd: Afterwards you may repeat the former, or ſome other convenient <hi>Clyſter;</hi> and by all means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſtore your Horſe's Appetite, according to the Method preſcrib'd in the <hi>ſixth</hi> and following Chapters.</p>
                        <p>You may eaſily try an Experiment, which is ſaid to cure this Diſtemper effectually, by giving your Horſe the <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Sheep,</hi> warm as it comes out of the Vein. I can only recommend this Remedy upon the Credit of others: but I can aſſure you I have often adminiſter'd that which follows, with very good Succeſs. In the firſt place, you muſt <hi>rake</hi> your Horſe, and after you have allow'd him ſome time to reſt, bring a young <hi>Sheep,</hi> or great <hi>Lamb</hi> into the Stable, (or for want of both theſe) a <hi>Calf.</hi> Cut its Neck, and receive its Blood into a Pipe, which muſt be heated, to prevent the Diſſipation of the Spirits, and the Cooling of the Blood: Then inject this Blood warm and pure without any Mixture, into the Horſe's <hi>Fundament</hi> by way of <hi>Clyſter.</hi> It moiſtens and tempers the great Gut, and Nature makes ſo good Uſe of it, that 'tis ſeldom or never rejected till the uſual time of <hi>Dunging,</hi> when it appears clotted among the Excrements. You may repeat it every twelve Hours, and if you think fit, give your Horſe no other Clyſter but this, which alone is richly worth a Dozen.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a general and almoſt infallible Rule, that few Horſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You may alſo try the following Method.</p>
                        <p>Bleed your Horſe, and half an Hour after give him two <hi>ſtinking Pills</hi> in a Pint of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of <hi>Beer,</hi> if it be in Summer; an Hour after repeat the Doſe, making him ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Pills</hi> entire with a Pint of <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Beer,</hi> and after a like Interval, give him two <hi>Pills.</hi> Half and Hour after the third and laſt Doſe, inject the following <hi>Clyſter.</hi> Boil two Ounces of the <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony</hi> reduc'd to fine Powder, in five Pints of <hi>Beer,</hi> or for want of that of <hi>Whey,</hi> and after two or three brisk Waums remove the Veſſel from the Fire; And adding a quarter of a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> inject the <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> blood-warm. If you cannot conveniently prepare a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> half an Hour after the laſt Doſe of <hi>Pills,</hi> thruſt a piece of <hi>Soap</hi> into his <hi>Fundament,</hi> to make him void that which is call'd the <hi>Molten-Greaſe:</hi> If you perceive that the Diſtemper is extremely violent, that is, if the Horſe be troubl'd with a vehement <hi>Palpitation of the Heart,</hi> if
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:179659:351"/>he be very reſtleſs, and riſe and lie down very often, and if you draw a great deal of white Slime, or greaſie Matter out of his <hi>Fundament,</hi> give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of <hi>Sheep's-Blood</hi> warm; for in this caſe you muſt inject a <hi>Clyſter</hi> every two Hours, to make the Horſe void the Humour, and even if the violence of the Diſeaſe be not abated, 'twill be convenient to give him three Doſes of the <hi>Pills,</hi> two or three Hours after the laſt of the former Doſes, by which means you may perhaps ſave your Horſe: You muſt not be afraid of adminiſtering ſo large a quantity of thoſe <hi>Pills;</hi> for their Heat is qualify'd by the <hi>Antimony</hi> that enters the Compoſition, and the <hi>Fixt Salt</hi> with which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, ſtops and fixes the Ebullition or Fermentation that occaſions all theſe Diſorders. I have ſeen Horſes ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper in the Stable, and others after ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Riding, that it would have ſeem'd altogether incredible, that ſuch a violent effect cou'd be produc'd by ſo ſlight a cauſe, if I had not been convinc'd of the truth of it by the teſtimony of my own Eyes. I have alſo obſerv'd this Diſtemper to proceed from the violent agitation of the Body, occaſion'd by the Pains of the <hi>Colic.</hi> In all theſe caſes the Cure is the ſame: But the moſt dangerous of all is that which is caus'd by violent Exerciſe; for the Horſe's Body is ſo extreamly over-heated, that it can hardly be reſtor'd to its natural Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>The above-mention'd Method of Cure is almoſt always attended with Succeſs, if it be ſeaſonably begun: But ſince 'tis very hard to perceive the firſt inſults of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, it oftentimes gives an irrecoverable Blow before you can be ſenſible of the danger.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ASſa-faetida</hi> is a certain Gum that grows in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where 'tis call'd <hi>Hingb:</hi> The beſt is gather'd in the Province of <hi>Utrad;</hi> but the greateſt part of what we have in <hi>France</hi> is brought from <hi>Perſia,</hi> and is very much inferiour to the other. In <hi>India</hi> it grows upon a Buſh or Shrub with ſmall Leaves reſembling <hi>Rue,</hi> whereas the Plant that produces it in <hi>Perſia,</hi> has Leaves like thoſe of a <hi>Figg</hi>-Tree: Theſe Plants uſually grow in ſtony and dry places, and the Gum begins to appear about the end of <hi>Summer,</hi> ſo that it muſt be gather'd in <hi>Autumn.</hi> Tho' it be very ſtinking the <hi>Indians</hi> who inhabit <hi>Guzarat</hi> make uſe of it in all their Sauces, and anoint their Pots and drinking Veſſels with it. Since this Gum is of excellent uſe for Horſes, and purifies the Blood very effectually, the curious Reader will perhaps be pleas'd to have a brief view of its Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Take the beſt and cleareſt <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> which is of a reddiſh Colour, <hi>Bay-Berries</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Liver of Antimony,</hi> of each an equal quantity. Beat 'em to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and mix 'em carefully in a large Mortar, with a ſufficient quantity of the beſt <hi>Vinegar,</hi> incorporating 'em with the Peſtle till they be perfectly united into a Maſs, pouring on the <hi>Vinegar</hi> by degrees. Then make it up into <hi>Pills,</hi> weighing fourteen Drams each, that being dry'd on the bottom of a Hair-Sieve, the weight of two <hi>Pills</hi> (which is the uſual Doſe) may amount to three Ounces, or ſomewhat more. You may keep the dry <hi>Pills</hi> as long as you pleaſe, without any diminution of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                     <p>I us'd formerly to diſſolve the <hi>Aſſa-faetida</hi> in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and afterwards evaporating the Solution to the thickneſs of <hi>Honey,</hi> I added the <hi>Powders;</hi> but I found by Experience, that by obſerving that Method, the Virtue of the Remedy was extreamly weaken'd, which partly conſiſts in a <hi>Volatil Salt,</hi> that exhales with the Steams of the <hi>Vinegar;</hi> whereas if the <hi>Pills</hi> be made up according to the above-mention'd Directions, you preſerve all the Virtue of the Medicines, and are not troubl'd with that inſupportable ſtench and ſharp Odour that uſually cauſes a violent <hi>Head-Ach.</hi> The old Method was brought to us from <hi>Holland,</hi> but beſides the alteration I have already taken notice of, I thought fit to add the <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> to the other two Ingredients; for they were not given with ſo great Succeſs in the Cure of <hi>Fevers</hi> before that addition; and beſides, their agreeableneſs to the Stomach is partly owing to the <hi>Antimony,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:179659:352"/>endu'd with a Virtue to promote Tranſpiration thro' the Pores, quickens the ſlow Operation of the <hi>Aſſa-foetida;</hi> and together with that produces ſuch excellent effects, that I am firmly reſolv'd to retain the Method propos'd in this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful efficacy of theſe <hi>Pills</hi> cannot be ſufficiently magnify'd: And thoſe who carry Horſes to an Army ought always to make Proviſion of a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this Medicine, to prevent the Diſorders that may be occaſion'd by the <hi>melting of the Greaſe, Foundering</hi> or <hi>Fevers.</hi> In theſe caſes, as ſoon as you perceive the leaſt ſign of the Diſtemper, you muſt bleed your Horſe, and half an Hour after give him two <hi>Pills,</hi> with a Quart of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of <hi>Beer</hi> in the Summer, then walk him a quarter of an Hour well cover'd, and ſet him up Bridl'd. If he Sweat 'tis a good ſign, tho' it rarely happens. If the Diſeaſe be violent, an Hour after the former Doſe, whether your Horſe be <hi>Founder'd,</hi> or his <hi>Greaſe Molten,</hi> give him another with a Quart of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of <hi>Beer,</hi> if it be in the Summer, keeping him ſtill cover'd, and walking him from time to time. If you perceive no ſigns of Amendment, if the Swelling of his Legs continue, or if he be troubl'd with a violent beating in his <hi>Flanks,</hi> give him a third Doſe an Hour after the ſecond: And there are few of thoſe Diſeaſes ſo ſtubborn, that will not yield to this Medicine ſo often repeated. The next Day, if your Horſe be very Sick, you may give him three other Doſes of <hi>Pills,</hi> but you muſt not bleed him a ſecond time. <hi>Note,</hi> That as ſoon as you let your Horſe Blood, you muſt pick his Feet, if he be <hi>Founder'd,</hi> and pour <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> into his Fore-Feet, ſtopping 'em with Flax, and laying hot Embers upon the Flax, with Splents over all. Renew the ſame Application thrice, once every ſix or four Hours, and twenty four Hours after you may ſuffer him to lye down.</p>
                     <p>The Horſe muſt neither eat nor drink for the ſpace of eight Hours, that is, four Hours after the laſt of the three Doſes; and even 'twou'd be convenient to keep him twenty four Hours from Drinking, and to give him neither <hi>Hay</hi> nor <hi>Oats</hi> for two or three Days after; but then he may ſafely return to his former Diet. Two or three Doſes of thoſe <hi>Pills,</hi> exhibited according to the above-mention'd Method, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Cure that fatal kind of <hi>Colic,</hi> which Farriers uſually call the <hi>Red-Gripes:</hi> And a <hi>Clyſter</hi> made of the warm Blood of a <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Calf</hi> is very effectual in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>You may depend on the wonderful efficacy of this Remedy, which you will find to exceed what cou'd be reaſonably expected from it.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe be ſeiz'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> which is an uſual effect of <hi>Morfounding,</hi> give him a Doſe of <hi>Pills,</hi> and cover him up very carefully: The beating of his <hi>Flanks</hi> will encreaſe at firſt, but it will abate quickly after. If you perceive no ſigns of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, repeat the Doſe next Morning, and perhaps the Horſe will recover if you give him frequent <hi>Clyſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſumm up all in one word; There are few Remedies ſo univerſally uſeful, and ſo portable, more effectual, and leſs chargeable than theſe <hi>Pills;</hi> and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear once more recommending them to all Lovers of Horſes.</p>
                     <p>I forgot to give you an important Caution concerning the choice of <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> for if it be not very pure and clean, without any mixture of Earth or Wood, the <hi>Pills</hi> muſt not be made up according to the above-mention'd Method; ſince the mixture of thoſe Impurities wou'd weaken their Virtues, and hinder their Operation; and therefore if you cannot procure fine reddiſh <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> you muſt diſſolve it in <hi>Vinegar</hi> on hot Embers, ſtrain it thro' a Linnen-Cloth, and evaporate it to the thickneſs of <hi>Honey;</hi> then add the <hi>Powders,</hi> and anointing your Hands with <hi>Oil,</hi> make up <hi>Pills</hi> weighing fourteen Drams each, drying 'em on the bottom of a Searce or Sieve; the Doſe is the ſame with that of the former. I believe theſe <hi>Pills</hi> are inferiour in Virtue to thoſe that are prepar'd according to the other Method, becauſe the <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> of the <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> exhales with the <hi>Vinegar;</hi> nor can I be induc'd to retract this Opinion by the Authority of a certain <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who imagines, that the <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> is included in the oily and viſcous Subſtance of the <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> and conſequently incapable of evaporating with the <hi>Vinegar.</hi>

                        </gap> a defect or ſtoppage of Tranſpiration, and oftentimes by a ſudden ſuppreſſion of a plentiful Sweat, which being ſpread thro' the whole habit of the Body, occaſions vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pains, and unweildineſs, or unfitneſs for Motion; ſo that the Legs cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their uſual Offices without extream Pain and difficulty. Sometimes a Horſe is <hi>Founder'd,</hi> when he is either expos'd to Cold, or ſuffer'd to cool ſuddenly after hard Riding or Labour; for the Pores are ſo ſtop'd by the Cold, that 'tis impoſſible for any thing to tranſpire thro' 'em. This kind of <hi>Foundering</hi> is more eaſily cur'd than the ſecond, which ſeizes on a Horſe in the Stable, without any preceding Exerciſe, and frequently proceeds from eating too large quantity of <hi>Oats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt kind is occaſion'd by violent Exerciſe, and riding the Horſe <hi>from his Wind,</hi> and beyond his Strength. For by reaſon of the agitation of the Humours, and their mixture with Acids, there ariſes an Ebullition or Fermentation that rarefies the moſt ſubtle Part of 'em, which ſhooting, like a Vapour, thro' the whole Habit of the Body, and even into the cavities of the Nerves, tho' very ſmall and imperceptible, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd into Water by a ſudden Cold. And this Water is oftentimes thicken'd into a ſort of Jelly, which not only ſtops the Paſſages of the Nerves, but makes 'em ſo ſtiff that they are not capable of any Motion without extream Pain and difficulty. You may eaſily conceive the reaſons why this rarefy'd Humour, which is afterwards reduc'd to Water, uſually falls upon the Legs: For Nature endeavouring to rid her ſelf of the troubleſome load of Humours, throws 'em upon the Legs that are weaken'd by Travelling.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Spirits or Vapours are always accompany'd with, or rather full of, a ſharp and biting Salt; for the Humours being out of their natural place, become eager and ſowre, and conſequently ſharp and biting. Thus the <hi>Foundering of the Body</hi> is quickly follow'd by a violent Pain which is almoſt always accompany'd with a <hi>Fever;</hi> and according to the abundance and thickneſs of thoſe ſharp Vapours or Spirits, the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> is more or leſs dangerous, and the Cure either difficult or eaſie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of <hi>Foundering</hi> that ſeizes on a Horſe in the Stable, and is occaſion'd either by eating too great a quantity of <hi>Oats,</hi> or by reaſon of the Pain which Lame Horſes uſually ſuffer, is not ſo eaſily cur'd as the former, becauſe of the abundance of Humours which, for want of moderate Exerciſe to promote Tranſpiration, ferment and cauſe the above-mention'd Diſorders. The difficulty of the Cure is alſo in a conſiderable meaſure owing to the redundancy of that ſharp and malignant Vapour which falls ſo violently upon the <hi>Legs,</hi> that without a ſeaſonable Application of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the <hi>Hoof</hi> is looſen'd from the <hi>Cronet,</hi> or the Bone of the Foot ſpoil'd under the <hi>Sole,</hi> and at laſt the Horſe ſinks under the violence of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Diſorders may be alſo occaſion'd by the firſt ſort of <hi>Foundering,</hi> if they be not prevented by timely Remedies: So that it may be truly ſaid, that both kinds are very dangerous, and (if they be accompany'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> and <hi>melting of the Greaſe</hi>) for the moſt part fatal.</p>
                     <p>There is a third ſort of <hi>Foundering</hi> which uſually ſeizes on Horſes in the Army, by reaſon of their eating green Corn; but it may be eaſily cur'd in twenty four Hours, and is oftentimes remov'd by Bleeding, or ſome trivial Remedy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foundering in the Body</hi> is very frequently accompany'd with <hi>Melting of the Greaſe,</hi> in which caſe the Horſe is ſeldom or never free from a <hi>Fever.</hi> This Complication of Diſtempers which <hi>Farriers</hi> call <hi>Cheſt-Foundering,</hi> is almoſt always fatal.</p>
                     <p>When after violent Exerciſe and plentiful Sweating, Horſes are ſuffer'd to cool of a ſudden, either by the coldneſs of the Place or Seaſon, or for want of walking them after Riding, they are almoſt always <hi>Founder'd;</hi> and ſince the Legs are more violently exercis'd than any other part of the Body, they are alſo more furiouſly attack'd by the Diſtemper, and expos'd to the Defluxion of the Humours.</p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:179659:353"/>
                     <p>To prevent theſe Diſorders you muſt <hi>walk</hi> your Horſe gently for ſome time, after long and violent <hi>Galloping,</hi> and even after any hard Labour, that the Humours which are fall'n upon the Legs, already weaken'd by Riding may be diſſipated, before they be condens'd into a Liquor, and that into a ſort of <hi>Jelly,</hi> which is the true cauſe of <hi>Foundering.</hi> It will not appear ſtrange to thoſe who conſider the danger of a ſudden alteration, or remove from extream Heat to exceſſive Cold, that Horſes uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Founder'd,</hi> when they are Water'd, and ridden up to the Belly in cold Water, immediately after violent Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe that has been already <hi>Founder'd,</hi> and has acquir'd an infirm habit of Body may relapſe into the ſame Diſtemper, if he be ſuffer'd to remain too long in the Stable, and eat too much <hi>Oats,</hi> and even after violent Exerciſes, which wou'd not have produc'd any ill effect, if he had never been <hi>Founder'd</hi> before. Thoſe who by reaſon of ſome Diſtemper in one of their <hi>Fore-Feet</hi> are forc'd to lay the weight of their Body upon the other, are obnoxious to this Diſtemper in the Stable, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always occaſion'd by too great a quantity of Nouriſhment: For the Crudities that are generated by the redundancy of Food occaſion a preternatural Heat; and the Ebullition or Fermentation, occaſion'd by the Heat, rarefies the moſt ſubtle Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours into Vapours, which are afterwards condens'd to Water, as I intimated before.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe is very apt to be <hi>Founder'd,</hi> if he be ridden while his Feet are Sore, or his Legs ſtiff: And the Cure of this kind of <hi>Foundering</hi> is extreamly difficult by reaſon of the Defluxion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ready fall'n upon the Lame Foot.</p>
                     <p>I cou'd never comprehend the reaſon of their Opinion, who pretend that a Horſe may be <hi>Founder'd</hi> by riding him thro' a River or Pond when he is very Thirſty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering him to Drink. For in very hot Weather, if you ſuffer your Horſe to Drink in the Evening, after violent Sweating, while his Body is ſtill hot, he may be eaſily <hi>Founder'd;</hi> whereas if you had hinder'd him from Drinking, the Danger wou'd have been certainly prevented.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes after a great Heat the <hi>Sinews</hi> are ſtiffen'd by cold, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion of Humours upon 'em. This Infirmity differs from <hi>Foundering;</hi> it ſeizes for the moſt part only in the <hi>Fore-Legs,</hi> and is eaſily Cur'd.</p>
                     <p>The moſt dangerous kind of <hi>Foundering</hi> is that which is accompany'd with a <hi>Fever;</hi> in which caſe the firſt and main ſcope of the Cure muſt be to remove the moſt urgent Symptom, that is, the <hi>Foundering:</hi> For tho' the <hi>Fever</hi> is very dangerous, and may kill the Horſe, 'tis purely accidental, and diſappears as ſoon as its Cauſe is taken away.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Foundering</hi> falls upon the Feet, the <hi>Cronet</hi> ſwells, and is ſeparated from the <hi>Hoof;</hi> and therefore as ſoon as you perceive thoſe Signs, make ſeveral Inciſions lengthwiſe along the <hi>Cronet,</hi> with a ſharp Lancet, piercing the Skin to open a paſſage to the Humour, which will come forth in form of a <hi>Reddiſh Water.</hi> After the voiding of theſe <hi>Scroſities,</hi> apply a <hi>Reſtringent Charge</hi> made of <hi>Bole-Armenic, Vinegar,</hi> and <hi>Whites of Eggs,</hi> or <hi>unſlack'd Lime,</hi> ſet in a convenient place till it crumble into Powder, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a Paſte or Dough with the <hi>Second Water</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which is the moſt excellent <hi>Aſtringent</hi> that can be preſcrib'd. Then dreſs the Sores with <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Salt:</hi> For if that Caution be neglected, the ſharp and malignant Humour, which is of an acid and penetrating Nature like <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> will certainly loos'n the Hoof, and make it fall off by the acrimony of the corroſive Salt of which 'tis full; and oftentimes it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the Bone of the Foot from the <hi>Coffin-Bone</hi> about the <hi>Toe;</hi> for the Bone of the Foot being dry'd by that corroſive Acid, and afterwards relax'd, that part which is depriv'd of Nouriſhment muſt neceſſarily fall away.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not take out the <hi>Sole</hi> till the dry and ſapleſs part of the Bone of the Foot be ready to fall, that is, till it burſt the <hi>Sole.</hi> In the mean time the Hoof is dry'd, ſpoil'd, and full of Circles, and the Horſe becomes unfit for Service, ſince he cannot Travel without exceſſive Pain. The Humour flows chiefly to the <hi>Toe,</hi> which uſually ſuffers moſt by theſe Diſorders; and therefore the Horſe treads on his <hi>Heels,</hi> after he is cur'd of the <hi>Foundering.</hi> WHen you perceive that the <hi>Foundering</hi> is fall'n upon the Feet, and that the Bone of the Foot preſſes the <hi>Sole,</hi> you muſt delay the taking out of the <hi>Sole</hi> as long as you can, endeavouring to preſerve it that it may contain the Bone of the Foot in its proper place; you muſt not open the <hi>Heel,</hi> but rub the <hi>Hoof</hi> near the <hi>Cronet,</hi> with a quarter of an <hi>Onion</hi> every Day till the <hi>Juice</hi> penetrate the <hi>Hoof.</hi> But in the general, as ſoon as the <hi>Foundering</hi> falls upon the <hi>Feet,</hi> and the Bone of the Foot appears to be dry'd, and to preſs the <hi>Sole,</hi> you may reckon your Horſe entirely
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:179659:353"/>loſt, and unfit for all manner of Service, unleſs for labouring on ſoft Ground. You will find a Remedy at the end of this Chapter to prevent theſe fatal Diſorders, and to remove the remaining Pains in the Foot that hinder the Horſe from walking boldly and eaſily after the Cure of the <hi>Foundering.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>taking up</hi> of the <hi>Paſtern-Veins</hi> as ſoon as the Diſeaſe falls upon the Foot, may produce a very good effect, but the Operation muſt be perform'd before the Bone of Foot appears viſibly to preſs the Sole.</p>
                     <p>I think my ſelf oblig'd to give you an Advice upon this occaſion, which perhaps few Perſons will eſteem it their Intereſt to follow. Whoever is Maſter of a Horſe of no very conſiderable value, that has been once <hi>Founder'd</hi> in his <hi>Feet,</hi> tho' the Hoofs were not looſen'd, ſhou'd never turn away a Cuſtomer; ſince 'tis folly to endeavour to make him fit for any thing but the <hi>Plow,</hi> unleſs you reſolve to beſtow more upon the Cure than the worth of the Horſe ever did or will amount to.</p>
                     <p>A Horſe that is quite <hi>Founder'd</hi> can neither walk forwards nor backwards, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without extream difficulty move his Legs, he is ſcarce able to put his Feet to the Ground, either abſolutely forſakes his Meat, or at beſt eats very little, he is <hi>Hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi> and dull, and oftentimes all theſe accidents are accompany'd with a great <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation</hi> or beating of the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Flanks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Horſes are only <hi>Founder'd</hi> in the <hi>Fore-Legs:</hi> But they are certainly in a very dangerous Condition that are <hi>Founder'd</hi> both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>behind.</hi>

                           <hi>A Remedy for</hi> Foundering.</head>
                        <p>You muſt endeavour to hinder the Humours that are ſpread thro' the <hi>Sinews</hi> of the <hi>Legs</hi> from falling upon the <hi>Feet;</hi> for that Defluxion either looſens the Hoof, ſpoils the Bone of the Foot, or makes the Feet irrecoverably Feeble and Lame. <hi>Farriers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prevent the falling of the Humours on the <hi>Feet,</hi> by binding a ſort of <hi>Garters</hi> very ſtreight about the Legs above the Knees and the Houghs. But this is ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious an Invention, and ſo contrary to reaſon and good Sence, that the moſt skilful Farriers have entirely laid aſide the uſe of it. This <hi>Ligature</hi> draws the Humour to the Legs inſtead of diverting it from 'em. For 'tis the uſual Cuſtom to bind a Man's Arm above the Elbow, to make the Vein ſwell when there is occaſion to let him Blood, and even the whole Arm ſwells when the <hi>Ligature</hi> is too ſtreight; and the ſame effect is produc'd by the <hi>Garters</hi> that are ty'd about a Horſe's Legs; beſides, the Pain that is already ſo violent is encreas'd by the Ligature. Nor are the Conſequences leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of another abſurd practice of <hi>Farriers</hi> in this caſe, who force the poor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Horſe to walk, tho' he can hardly ſtir a Leg without ſuffering ſuch intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pain, as wou'd doubtleſs make him <hi>Founder'd</hi> if he were not ſo before.</p>
                        <p>To proceed Methodically in the Cure of ſo dangerous a Diſtemper, you muſt, in the firſt place, bleed your Horſe in the Neck, receive his Blood in an Earthen Pot, and mixing a Pint of <hi>Brandy</hi> with it, Charge his whole Legs to the Hough. Then pour boiling <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> into his Feet, with Flax and Splents to keep it in, applying the ſame round the <hi>Cronet,</hi> with Flax and a convenient Bandage. Half an Hour after give him two Ounces of good <hi>Treacle,</hi> and four Ounces of <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> in a Quart of <hi>White</hi> (or for want of that <hi>Red</hi>) Wine, keeping him Bridl'd two Hours, without ſtirring from the place. Then give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> with two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Bolychreſt,</hi> and two Hours after another. Unbridle him an Hour after the laſt <hi>Clyſter,</hi> giving him <hi>Bran</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi> to eat, and the <hi>White-Water</hi> to Drink, and ſuffer him not to lye down for the ſpace of forty eight Hours. Renew the Application of <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> to his Feet every eight or ten Hours; and if he be not ſound the next Day, repeat the <hi>Potion</hi> and <hi>Clyſters,</hi> but not the <hi>Bleeding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> that inhabit <hi>Barbary,</hi> bleed their <hi>Founder'd</hi> Horſes, and give 'em a Pint of the Juice of white <hi>Onions,</hi> mixt with a little Juice of <hi>Garlic,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame two Days after. This is a good Remedy, but not ſo effectual in this Country.</p>

                        <p>Aſſoon as you perceive your Horſe to be <hi>founder'd,</hi> bring him to the Bank of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and open his <hi>Neck-Vein,</hi> ſlack'ning the Cord that he may not bleed; then lead him into the Water up to the middle of the Belly, and tye the Cord till the Blood come forth, ſlackening it again after you have taken away about four Pounds of Blood, and keeping him in the Water half an Hour after the Blood is ſtopp'd. Aſſoon as he comes into the Stable ſtuff his Fore-Feet with boil'd <hi>Barley,</hi> apply'd hot, with Splints to keep it in, and make him drink the following Potion. Take ſix large white <hi>Onions</hi> cut into ſlices, and boil 'em a quarter of an Hour in two Pints and a half of Wine; then ſtrain out the Liquor, ſqueezing the Onions very hard, add two Ounces of <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> in Powder, and make your Horſe drink the whole. An Hour after give him this <hi>Clyſter:</hi> Boil two Ounces of the <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony</hi> reduc'd to fine Powder, in five Pints of <hi>Beer;</hi> and after one Waum, remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and diſſolving the quantity of an Egg of <hi>freſh Butter</hi> in the Liquor, make a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> to be injected luke-warm. Let your Horſe ſtand bridl'd an Hour after he has voided the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and then give him another of the ſame, ſtopping his Feet with freſh <hi>Barley,</hi> as before. Then unbridle him, giving him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi> to eat, and the <hi>white Water</hi> to drink: Litter him well, and ſuffer him not to lie down for the ſpace of two Days. Afterwards repeat the <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and renew the Application of hot <hi>Barley</hi> to his Feet from time to time: Or proceed as follows;</p>
                        <p>Bleed your Horſe in the <hi>Neck-Vein,</hi> charge his Shoulders and Legs with his own <hi>Blood,</hi> and half an Hour after make him drink a Quart of Water with two Pounds of <hi>Salt.</hi> An Hour after give him a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and ſtop his Fore-feet with <hi>Pidgeon's-Dung</hi> fry'd with <hi>Oil of Walnuts,</hi> and apply it hot, not only to his Feet, but alſo about the <hi>Cronet,</hi> with Tow and a convenient Bandage. If the Horſe be not cur'd, the next Day repeat the <hi>Potion,</hi> and above all inject <hi>Clyſters</hi> frequently, and renew the <hi>aſtringent</hi> Application, both within his Feet, and about the <hi>Cronet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The following Method has been frequently try'd with Succeſs. Bleed your Horſe plentifully in the <hi>Neck,</hi> and rub his <hi>Fore-Legs</hi> very hard with ſtrong <hi>Vinegar</hi> mixt with a large quantity of <hi>Salt</hi> for the ſpace of half an Hour. Then waſh the <hi>menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> parts of one or two <hi>Smocks,</hi> which may be eaſily procur'd among the <hi>Landreſſes</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> with three Pints of Wine, and diſſolving in the ſame Wine, the <hi>Excrements</hi> voided at one time by a <hi>Child</hi> of ſix or ſeven Years of Age; make your Horſe drink the whole, and two Hours after give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> ſtuffing his Feet with boiling <hi>Oil of Walnuts,</hi> bound up with Flax and Splints, and applying a <hi>reſtringent Charge</hi> about the <hi>Cronet.</hi> After he has ſtood bridl'd two Hours give him another <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and aſſoon as that is voided, unbridle him that he may eat and drink, but you muſt not ſuffer him to lie down for the ſpace of forty eight Hours. Continue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Clyſters</hi> as long as he is troubl'd with a <hi>Beating in his Flanks,</hi> and renew the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both of the hot <hi>Oil,</hi> and of the <hi>reſtringent Charge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Before all other Remedies I think my ſelf oblig'd to prefer the <hi>Stinking Pills,</hi> which I uſe after this manner. I order the Horſe to be let blood, all his four Legs to be rubb'd with his own <hi>Blood</hi> mixt with <hi>Brandy,</hi> boiling <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> to be pour'd into his Feet, and the ſame to be apply'd moderately hot about the <hi>Cronet</hi> with Flax and a Bandage: Half an Hour after the Bleeding, give him two <hi>ſtinking Pills,</hi> with a Quart of <hi>Wine,</hi> or of <hi>Beer</hi> if it be in the Summer; repeating the ſame Doſe an Hour after, and the third time after a like Interval. An Hour after the laſt Doſe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of a Decoction of the <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony,</hi> or <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> in <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Whey,</hi> and after he has voided the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> ſuffer him to eat and drink, litter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him well, without permitting him to lie down, till he be out of Danger. When the <hi>Pills</hi> are given in the Morning, the Horſe is uſually cur'd before Night; if not, I give him three Doſes, as before, the next Day, repeating the <hi>Clyſters,</hi> and renewing the Application of <hi>Oil of Bay.</hi> I continue after the ſame manner till the Horſe be completely cur'd, and I have even given to ſome Horſes <hi>thirty Pills</hi> in <hi>four Days.</hi> After a violent <hi>Foundering</hi> there remains a certain Numneſs, Stiffneſs, and Uweildineſs, which may be remov'd by walking the Horſe gently, and injecting two or three <hi>Clyſters</hi> with <hi>Scoriae of Liver of Antimony,</hi> or <hi>Sal Polychreſt,</hi> every Day; but thoſe Horſes are apt to be <hi>founder'd</hi> by the leaſt Exceſs. 'Tis to be obferv'd that the Horſe muſt not be ſuffer'd to eat <hi>Corn</hi> for ſome time after the Cure of this Diſtemper, till he be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:179659:354"/>completely recover'd; for the Eating of <hi>Oats</hi> has oftentimes occaſion'd Relapſes into a worſe Condition than before.</p>
                        <p>It will perhaps be expected that I ſhou'd give a Reaſon, why I order the Horſes to be well <hi>litter'd,</hi> when they are not ſuffer'd to lie down; and therefore for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who may think that Caution needleſs, it will not be improper to put them in mind that the <hi>Littering</hi> keeps the Horſe's Feet warm in Winter, and eaſie both in Winter and Summer: And as for the other Circumſtance, I ſuffer the ſick Horſe to lie down, aſſoon as I perceive any conſiderable Amendment, which happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in leſs than ſix Hours; but if the Cure proceed more ſlowly, as it uſually doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> when the <hi>Foundering</hi> is inveterate, or accompany'd with a <hi>Fever,</hi> I keep him from lying down for the ſpace of eight and forty Hours, after which that Poſture cannot obſtruct the Cure.</p>
                        <p>If I ſhou'd ask now of the Generality of Farriers, why they put <hi>Faggots</hi> between Horſe's Legs, they cou'd only tell me that they have ſeen others do ſo before: But this Cuſtom is no leſs obſerv'd than that of tying <hi>Garters</hi> about the Legs.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall take this Occaſion to mention another Abuſe, which is uſually committed in the Cure of the Diſtempers, for by Bleeding the Horſe in the Veins of the <hi>Thighs,</hi> the Humour that Cauſes the <hi>Foundering</hi> is <hi>drawn</hi> to the affected Part inſtead of being <hi>diverted from it;</hi> whereas the Diverſion is effectually perform'd by Bleeding in the <hi>Neck.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe who let the Horſe blood in the <hi>Toe</hi> are guilty of a more dangerous Errour; for they draw the Humour to the Foot, from whence it ought to be diverted by all poſſible Means, ſuch as the Application of <hi>Oil of Bay, Hog's Dung,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes while a Horſe remains in the Stable without any preceding Travel or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he is ſeiz'd with a certain <hi>Rheumatiſm,</hi> which falls ſo violently upon his Reins, or the lower part of his Back, that he can hardly draw his Hips after him; and when he goes his hinder Parts reel as if his Back was broken; he falls upon his Buttocks, and croſſes his hinder Legs. Some Horſes in this Caſe touch the Ground with their <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> behind, but are neither apt to fall on their Buttocks, nor are troubl'd with a rolling of their hinder Parts. This Infirmity is of the ſame Nature with <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,</hi> and proceeds from the ſame Cauſes: For the Humour falls upon the <hi>Back, Hips,</hi> and ſometimes on the <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> behind, while the fore Parts are almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly found. Such Horſes as have been already <hi>Founder'd,</hi> are more ſubject to this Diſtemper than others, and are ſometimes ſurpriz'd with it as they walk only at a <hi>Foot-Pace,</hi> without being heated in the leaſt: But theſe Accidents are very rare, and Horſes are uſually taken with this. Infirmity in the Stable without any preceding Labour.</p>
                        <p>The ſureſt Way is to begin the Cure as ſoon as may be; for if the Diſeaſe be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to get ground or take root, it will not yield to the beſt Medicines; and tho' the Horſe continue to eat and drink heartily, he will remain irrecoverably infirm, and incapable of performing the leaſt Service: I have ſeen ſeveral Horſes, whom their Maſters were oblig'd to kill, after they had in vain ſpent ſeveral Months in the Cure; and therefore as ſoon as you perceive that the Horſe cannot walk, without drawing his hinder Parts after him, and croſſing his hinder Legs, and that he is always ready to fall upon his Buttocks, you muſt immediately take about three Pounds of Blood out of his <hi>Neck-Veins,</hi> and charge his Back with his own Blood mixt with <hi>Brandy:</hi> Half an Hour after give him a Doſe of the <hi>ſtinking Pills</hi> with a Pint and a half of Wine, repeating the Doſe after the ſame manner as in the Cure of <hi>Foundering,</hi> and injecting a <hi>Clyſter</hi> an Hour after the laſt Doſe; after which let him ſtand two Hours bridl'd, and the Cure will be perfected, provided it be ſeaſonably begun. Give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> for five or ſix Days without any <hi>Oats,</hi> walking him every Day in your Hand; and obſerve the ſame Directions as in the former Caſe. If one Day be not ſufficient to perfect the Cure, the next Day you muſt repeat the three Doſes of <hi>Pills,</hi> and the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> as before.</p>
                        <p>I ſaw a Horſe that was cur'd of a dangerous <hi>Stavers,</hi> who by the falling of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe upon the Back and hinder Parts, was ſeiz'd with the above-mention'd Symptoms: for he walk'd as if his Back had been broken, and his <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> touch'd the Ground. The <hi>Farrier</hi> that cur'd him of the <hi>Stavers</hi> imagining that his <hi>Back</hi> was <hi>ſway'd,</hi> thought ſit to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> and made ſeveral Holes in his Skin, all over the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179659:355"/>lower part of the Back, which he cover'd with a Plaiſter, and then hung him up from the Ground, leaving him in that Poſture till the Scabbs fell off, after which unhanging him, and not finding the leaſt Amendment, I was call'd to his Aſſiſtance; and having order'd the Horſe to be let blood, gave him three Doſes of the <hi>ſtinking Pills,</hi> but in vain, for he was irrecoverably loſt; and after he had liv'd about a Year in the Stable, unfit for any manner of Service, they were at laſt forc'd to diſpatch him. I dare not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm, tho' I may venture to ſay with a <hi>perhaps,</hi> that he might have been cur'd if the Pills had been given aſſoon as the Diſtemper ſeiz'd his Back and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parts.</p>
                        <p>To conclude; This is a very dangerous Diſeaſe, and even incurable if it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to fix, and take Root: But the Danger may be prevented by a timely Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Remedies.</p>

                     <p>THE Pains that frequently remain after <hi>Foundering,</hi> hinder the Horſe from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteadily; and from ſetting his Foot flat upon the Ground, for he treads only upon his <hi>Heel</hi> to eaſe the <hi>Toe.</hi> The Humour that caus'd the <hi>Foundering</hi> falling down from the Leg, ſlides between the Bone of the Foot and the <hi>Hoof;</hi> and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat being as it were ſtifl'd by the ſharp Humour, the fore-part of the Foot is depriv'd of its appointed ſhare of Nouriſhment, and conſequently is hardend, dry'd, and weaken'd. The End of the Bone next the Toe, falls down upon the <hi>Sole,</hi> and ſhrinks; ſo that it muſt neceſſarily be ſeparated from the ſound Part of the Bone. This Separation is not the Work of one Day, but notwithſtanding the extreme Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which attends it, it may be at laſt happily perfected, if <hi>Nature,</hi> who is the beſt Judge of the Time, and moſt skilful Performer of the Operation, be aſſiſted by a ſeaſonable and regular Obſervance of the following Method.</p>
                     <p>If your Horſe tread only on his Heels, ſo that you have reaſon to conclude that that the fore-part of the Foot is wither'd, or dry'd up, and if you perceive its Hollowneſs by knocking upon the Hoof, pluck off the Shooe, and having par'd the Foot a little, ſet on a <hi>Pantofle-Shooe,</hi> ſuch as you will find explain'd in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that treats of the Shooing of Horſes that have <hi>Narrow Heels,</hi> and apply the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remedy. <hi>Note;</hi> That when you ſhooe a Horſe in this Condition, you muſt always leave the <hi>Sole</hi> as firm as may be; for the Succeſs of the Cure depends chiefly upon that, and on the falling away of the dry part of the Bone, which may be alſo promoted by the uſe of the following <hi>Decoction</hi> or <hi>Broth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If your Horſe be troubl'd with Pains in his Feet, without any Sign of the Dryneſs or Separation of the Bone; you muſt only pare the Feet, ſet on very eaſie Shooes, and apply the following <hi>Broth.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <p>Take <hi>Brandy</hi> a Quart, ſtrong <hi>Vinegar</hi> a Pint and a half, <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> a Pound; Add a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Bean</hi>-Flower, and boil to the Conſiſtency of a thick Broth, ſtirring it perpetually over a gentle Fire. Then pour it boiling hot into the Foot, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Tow and Splints to keep it in; and apply the ſame Broth, aſſoon as you can endure to touch it with your Hand, to the <hi>Cronet</hi> with Tow. Renew the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thrice every twenty four Hours, and if the Pain be not very inveterate, the Horſe will certainly recover.</p>
                        <p>If the fore-part of the Bone of the Foot be dry'd, and fall down upon the <hi>Sole,</hi> 'twill be very convenient to <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Paſtern-Veins,</hi> after the Application of the Broth, that the Humour which is carry'd to the Foot with the Blood, may be the ſooner exhauſted; beſides ſeveral other Reaſons already intimated.</p>

                        <p>If the Foot be ſo extremely ſhrunk and dry'd up, that the Horſe cannot go, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtand, you muſt <hi>take out the Sole,</hi> and ſear the End of the Bone of the Foot, ſuffering it to fall quite away; after which the <hi>Sole</hi> will grow again, and the Horſe may recover, if you ſet on a <hi>Pantofle</hi>-Shooe, and give the Foot time to gather ſtrength; but you muſt never expect that it will be good, handſome, or fit for Service.</p>

                     <p>THis is a Diſeaſe of the Skin, which makes the <hi>Hair</hi> peel and fall away, and the <hi>Hide</hi> grow thick, hard, dry, rough, and even wrinkl'd in ſeveral Places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vegetius,</hi> in the <hi>ſeventy firſt</hi> Chapter of the <hi>third</hi> Book of his <hi>Ars Veterinaria,</hi> defines it in theſe Words; <hi>The Scab or Mange, is a loathſome and unſeemly Diſtemper of Cattle:</hi> But this is no true <hi>Definition,</hi> ſince it explains not the Nature of the Thing <hi>defin'd.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Nouriſhment may occaſion this Diſtemper, which proceeds from a ſharp, burnt, and ſalt Humour, that is, from an <hi>Acid</hi> full of ſharp and corroſive Spirits, and Salts: The ſame <hi>Acid</hi> may be generated by Hunger and Fatigues, and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company with <hi>mangy</hi> Horſes. It may alſo be communicated to thoſe Horſes that are rubb'd with the ſame Curry-Combs, and Bruſhes, or Duſting-Cloths, that were formerly made uſe of for Horſes infected with this Diſtemper; and to conclude, The <hi>Mange</hi> may be an Effect of the Careleſneſs of the Groom, in dreſſing his Horſe, or of the Neglect of ſeaſonable Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>We may conclude, that a Horſe is troubl'd with the <hi>Mange</hi> when he rubs one part of his Body more than the reſt; as for Example, his <hi>Joints, Legs, Tail,</hi> and <hi>Mane,</hi> in which Caſe you muſt feel the Part, and if you perceive that the <hi>Hide</hi> is thicker than uſually, 'tis a Sign that your Horſe is <hi>Mangy.</hi> Sometimes this Diſtemper is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but for the moſt part it comes by degrees, and appears ſometimes in one Part, and ſometimes in another.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe may be divided into two Kinds, the <hi>dry,</hi> and <hi>ulcerated Mange.</hi> In the firſt there appears nothing upon the Skin but a ſort of mealy Scales which make the Hair fall quite away. The Cure is extremely difficult, and uſually the Cauſe is either Cold, or Hunger.</p>
                     <p>The other Kind breaks out into little Swellings and Scurfs, which being ſeparated, the Part remains ſore and raw. This is more eaſily cur'd than the former Kind, unleſs when 'tis ſeated in the <hi>Mane</hi> or <hi>Tail,</hi> where it ſticks very faſt, and can hardly be rooted out; becauſe the <hi>Hide</hi> in theſe Parts is ſo thick, that the ſtrongeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies can ſcarce force their Paſſage thro' it. Both Kinds are cur'd with the ſame Remedies.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>
                           <hi>A Remedy for the</hi> Mange.</head>
                        <p>You muſt begin the Cure of this Diſtemper with the Preparation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that cauſes it: For you muſt never proceed to anoint your Horſe's Body, till you have remov'd the internal Cauſe of the Humor that is driven outwards by Nature; leſt by incloſing and concentrating the corrupt Humour in the Body, the Entrails be heated, and the Noble Parts vitiated. <hi>Bleeding</hi> is almoſt always neceſſary in this Caſe to allay the Heat of the Blood, and promote its Circulation. <hi>Vegetius</hi> has very prudently order'd the chuſing of fit Places for letting of Blood, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Variety of Caſes, and the different Parts of the Body, where the Humour is lodg'd: Thus, for Example, if the <hi>Mange</hi> appear in the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Neck,</hi> you muſt let your Horſe blood in the <hi>Head,</hi> if in the <hi>Shoulders, Breaſt,</hi> or <hi>fore Legs,</hi> bleed him in the <hi>Brisket;</hi> if the <hi>Back</hi> be infected, in the <hi>Flanks;</hi> and if the <hi>hinder Legs,</hi> or <hi>Hips</hi> be <hi>mangy,</hi> you muſt open a Vein in the <hi>Thighs.</hi> But I cannot approve the <hi>Purgation</hi> appointed by the ſame Author; for the Roots of <hi>wild Cucumbers</hi> or <hi>Elaterium,</hi> which he preſcribes to be mixt with <hi>Oats,</hi> leaves too great a Heat in the Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſing a plentiful Evacuation: And therefore you may content your ſelf with
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:179659:356"/>obſerving his Method of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and adminiſter one of the <hi>Purging</hi> Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the Cure of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> which I only uſe in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>After <hi>Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purgation,</hi> repeated if need require, give your Horſe two or three Doſes of the <hi>Cinnabar Pills,</hi> two Pills for a Doſe. This Medicine purifies the Blood, and expels the malignant ſerous Humours, ſo that afterwards you may eaſily Cure the <hi>Mange</hi> with any common <hi>Ointment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If your Horſe be ſeiz'd with this Diſtemper in the <hi>Spring,</hi> or about the end of the <hi>Winter,</hi> after you have bled him plentifully in the <hi>Neck,</hi> turn him out to <hi>Graſs,</hi> letting him run Night and Day in the open Fields. If he continue ſtill <hi>Mangy</hi> you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Ointments,</hi> which you will find afterwards deſcrib'd; but <hi>Graſs</hi> is certainly one of the beſt Remedies for the <hi>Mange.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If your Horſe grow <hi>Mangy</hi> in the <hi>Summer,</hi> you muſt take away a large quantity of Blood, and then give him <hi>moiſten'd Bran</hi> (for without neceſſity he ought not to eat <hi>Oats</hi>) mixt with convenient Herbs chop'd ſmall. Thus you may give him <hi>Scabious, ſharp pointed Dock, Fumitory,</hi> and <hi>Wild-Succory,</hi> of each one handful, and half an Ounce of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> well mixt with his <hi>Bran</hi> every Morning and Evening for eight Days together.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Mange</hi> appear in the <hi>Winter,</hi> take the Roots of the ſame Herbs. If he will not eat 'em make a Decoction of the Herbs or Roots in three Pints of <hi>White-Wine,</hi> and pouring off a Quart of it, add an Ounce of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> in Powder, and make him drink it in the Morning, keeping him bridl'd two Hours before, and as long after. This Decoction prepares the corrupt Humours that are in the Body for Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                        <p>If you have not the conveniency to put your Horſe to <hi>Graſs</hi> in the <hi>Spring,</hi> or if he have too ſtrong an averſion to the <hi>Cinnabar Pills,</hi> you muſt firſt <hi>bleed</hi> and <hi>purge</hi> him, and afterwards give him every Day two Ounces of <hi>Liver of Antimony</hi> in Powder, mixt with <hi>moiſten'd Bran.</hi> This Remedy will drive all Impurities out of the Body; and afterwards the leaſt <hi>Ointment, Balls,</hi> or Compound <hi>Water,</hi> will ſuffice to dry up the <hi>Mange.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Golden Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXXIX. will produce the ſame effect, if it be given for fifteen Days together.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Remedies cure the <hi>Mange</hi> radically in any ſeaſon of the Year, but not ſo eaſily in <hi>Winter</hi> as in <hi>Summer.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. CXLVII. <hi>The</hi> Neat-Herds Ointment <hi>for the</hi> Pains, <hi>or</hi> watry Sores <hi>in the</hi> Legs, <hi>foul</hi> Wounds <hi>or</hi> Ulcers, <hi>and the</hi> Mange.</head>
                     <p>TAke burnt <hi>Allom</hi> and <hi>Borax</hi> in fine Powder, of each two Ounces; <hi>white Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> beaten to a very fine Powder, of each four Ounces; put 'em into a very clean Pot, with two Pounds of <hi>Honey,</hi> and boil 'em over a clear Fire, ſtirring all the Subſtances together till they be well incorporated. After the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is cold, add two Ounces of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> keep it well cover'd for uſe, ſtirring it once a Day during the firſt ſix Days. One Application, or two at moſt, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Cure, but you muſt take care that the Horſe may not be able to reach it with his Teeth. If his <hi>Tail</hi> be <hi>Mangy</hi> you muſt firſt ſcrape the place.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this Ointment, when 'tis laid on too thick, makes the Skin fall off like Scales, but without any danger, for the Scab may be eaſily ſeparated by anointing it with <hi>Tallow;</hi> after which the Horſe is perfectly freed from the <hi>Mange,</hi> and even tho' the whole <hi>Cuticula</hi> or Scurf-Skin fall off, it will come again with the Hair, rarely leaving any conſiderable Mark.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Ointment</hi> is not only good for the <hi>Mange,</hi> but alſo for the <hi>Pains,</hi> running and watry <hi>Sores,</hi> foul <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Ulcers, Arreſts, Mules,</hi> and other ſuch like Sores, which it dries up effectually; but it ought not to be apply'd when the Legs are ſwoll'n or <hi>gourdy;</hi> for after the drying up of the Sores, the Legs remain ſtill ſwoll'n and full of Humours, which will certainly break forth in ſome other Part; and therefore the Humour muſt be firſt evacuated by the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> or ſome other convenient Remedy, and then dry'd up with this <hi>Ointment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Remedy cures the Sores in the <hi>Urinary</hi> paſſages of <hi>Oxen,</hi> that proceed from their being naſtily kept, and heals <hi>Wounds</hi> in Horſes, but not without great Pain and Smarting. 'Tis a ſort of <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> of excellent uſe for the healing of foul Sores in the Feet or any other part of a Horſe's Body. 'Tis ſtronger than the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment,</hi> but does not bind ſo effectually; and is not inferiour to the beſt <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> for cleanſing Wounds and Sores, and conſuming corrupt Fleſh.</p>

                           <hi>Of the</hi> Mange <hi>or</hi> Itch <hi>in a Horſe's</hi> Tail.</head>
                        <p>This Diſtemper proceeds from the heat of the Blood, which is full of ſharp and biting <hi>Seroſities;</hi> and the Horſe never leaves off ſcrubbing till the Skin be peel'd off from his <hi>Rump.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bleed him in the <hi>Neck,</hi> and the next Day in the <hi>Tail;</hi> then rub the Roots of the Hair with <hi>black Soap,</hi> and twenty four Hours after chafe the infected place with a <hi>Lye,</hi> rubbing it by turns with the <hi>Soap</hi> and <hi>Lye;</hi> and after five or ſix Applications the Horſe will be ſound: or rub the Roots of the <hi>Hair</hi> every Day, with <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſteep'd in <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Succeſs of theſe Remedies do not anſwer your expectation, cut the <hi>Rump</hi> or upper part of the Tail to the Bone with a <hi>Razor</hi> or <hi>Lancet,</hi> reaching downwards three Fingers breadth in length; and after the Wound has done bleeding, apply red-hot Embers to it, and the next Day waſh it with warm <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Urine,</hi> laying on the red-hot Embers, and renewing the Application thrice; after which the <hi>Wound</hi> will heal of it ſelf, and the <hi>Itching</hi> ceaſe to torment the Horſe. The ſame effect may be produc'd by ſtopping the Wound with <hi>Salt.</hi>

                        <p>Some Horſes are alſo ſubject to an odd ſort of Diſtemper in their <hi>Tails;</hi> for a certain Moiſture breaks forth out of the Skin, and gliding along the Hair, dyes it of a red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour about two Fingers breadth from the Roots, whereas it retains its natural Colour near the Skin; and this Humour is ſo ſharp that it makes the Hair ſo rotten, that it breaks as ſoon as you touch it. This loathſome Symptom appears only in the middle of <hi>white Tails,</hi> and there cannot be a greater or more unſeemly deformity in a Horſe than this <hi>Redneſs</hi> in his <hi>Tail</hi> reſembling the colour of <hi>Beer,</hi> beſides that the Hair is rotten, and very apt to break.</p>
                        <p>This Diſtemper may be cur'd by the above-mention'd Remedy, eſpecially by Inciſion.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who cut their Horſe's <hi>Tails</hi> prevent this deformity; but ſince all Horſe's Tails are not cut, and the loſs of that part wou'd quite ſpoil the gracefulneſs of a <hi>manag'd,</hi> or <hi>led</hi> Horſe for War, 'tis fit to be provided with proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                        <p>In a ſet of ſix <hi>Coach-Horſes</hi> three were troubl'd with this Diſtemper, who were all cur'd by an Inciſion made according to the above-mention'd Directions in the top of the <hi>Tail,</hi> reaching downwards four Fingers breadth in length.</p>

                     <p>THere is no <hi>Corruption</hi> without <hi>Generation;</hi> for what Nature loſes in one part ſhe regains in another. Every <hi>Plant,</hi> and almoſt every <hi>Animal</hi> is a kind of Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of a particular Species of <hi>Inſects.</hi> When the vital Heat is vitiated it becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing its natural task of concocting the Aliments, and conſequently the whole oeconomy of Nature is diſſolv'd; for when the Nouriſhment of Horſes, as well as of all other Animals is not perfectly digeſted, Crudities and Humours are generated, which are eaſily corrupted, and their Putrefaction produces ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Worms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have already ſpoken of the <hi>Worms</hi> that occaſion the <hi>Colic</hi> and violent <hi>Gripings.</hi> Some of 'em are white, long, and ſharp-pointed, appearing in the Horſe's Dung, and are not very dangerous; but thoſe that are long and ſmall, reſembling great <hi>Needles,</hi> are extreamly dangerous: ſome are red, ſhort, and thick, of the bigneſs of ſmall <hi>Beans,</hi> which torment and oftentimes kill the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Worms,</hi> not unlike to <hi>Wood-Lice,</hi> only they have not ſo many Feet; they are of a reddiſh brown Colour, ſomewhat velvetted on the back, conſiſting of divers Folds. They abide in the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and devour all the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; ſo that tho' the Horſe be a great Eater he cannot poſſibly thrive, ſince his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:179659:358"/>Stomach prepares Nouriſhment only for the <hi>Worms,</hi> which ſometimes by reaſon of their multitude, pierce the <hi>Stomach</hi> in ſeveral Parts, and kill the Horſe with extreme Pain: And I have even ſeen thouſands of 'em in the <hi>Stomachs</hi> of dead Horſes. 'Tis impoſſible to know certainly when a Horſe is troubl'd with theſe <hi>Worms,</hi> for they cauſe no <hi>Griping,</hi> and never appear in the Dung, ſince they always abide in the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> or <hi>Maw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Horſe is troubl'd with this laſt ſort of <hi>Worms,</hi> he commonly becomes lean and ſluggiſh, he looks upon his Belly or Flanks, his Hair ſtares, and whatever Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment he takes, he never grows fat.</p>
                     <p>When Horſes are taken up from the <hi>Graſs,</hi> they are ſubject to certain ſmooth, or velveted <hi>Worms,</hi> about half the Bigneſs of <hi>Catter-pillars,</hi> which appear near the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and are uſually call'd <hi>Bots.</hi> Theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> are not dangerous; for you may take 'em away with your Hand without any Medicine.</p>

                        <p>The Remedies already preſcrib'd for deſtroying the <hi>Worms</hi> that occaſion a ſort of <hi>Colic,</hi> are good againſt all the various Kinds of thoſe <hi>Inſects:</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Powder</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in that Chapter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mercury,</hi> if it be duly prepar'd, is, in my Opinion, the moſt powerful and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy of <hi>Worms:</hi> For it not only deſtroys 'em, but prevents their future Growth, and therefore you cannot give a better Remedy than well-prepar'd <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> or <hi>Cinnabar</hi> mixt with the <hi>Cordial-Powder,</hi> or the <hi>Cinnabar-Pills;</hi> for the very Steam of <hi>Mercury</hi> deſtroys the <hi>Worms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may eaſily kill <hi>Bots,</hi> or <hi>Worms</hi> that ſtick about the <hi>Fundament,</hi> by giving your Horſe an Ounce or two of the Powder or Flower of <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd <hi>Oats.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hay</hi> moiſten'd with the Solution of <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> kills Worms effectually. The green Leaves of a <hi>Willow,</hi> or <hi>Peach-Tree,</hi> chopt ſmall, and mixt with <hi>Oats,</hi> are very good in this Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Half an Ounce of <hi>Savin</hi> in Powder, mixt with <hi>Oats,</hi> and given for ten or twelve Days together, will infallibly deſtroy the <hi>Worms.</hi> If you keep your Horſe five or ſix Days in a <hi>Sheep-Cote</hi> without Litter, all the <hi>Worms</hi> in his Body will certainly come forth, by reaſon of the <hi>Nitre</hi> contain'd in the Sheeps-Dung; but ſince the Cauſe is not remov'd, you muſt give him the <hi>purging</hi> Medicine preſcrib'd in the following Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The Seed of <hi>Zedoary</hi> beaten, and mixt with <hi>Bran</hi> moiſten'd with Wine, kills all ſorts of <hi>Worms.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Seeds of <hi>Coriander, Citrons, Oranges,</hi> and <hi>Lemons,</hi> the Shavings of <hi>Ivory,</hi> and of <hi>Hart's-Horn.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Pills</hi> preſcrib'd for <hi>Purſiveneſs,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXIX. expel all ſorts of <hi>Worms,</hi> if one of 'em be given daily in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> for ſeven or eight Days together. You may give a Horſe that is troubl'd with the <hi>Worms</hi> an Ounce of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> with a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>Cordial-Powder</hi> in <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> continuing for ſome time: Or take four Ounces of <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> and two Ounces of the <hi>Cordial-Powder,</hi> and with a Pound of <hi>freſh Butter</hi> make 'em up into <hi>Pills,</hi> to be given with a Quart of Wine.</p>
                        <p>Six Drams of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> made up into two Pills with an Ounce of <hi>Treacle,</hi> is an admirable Remedy in this Caſe: The <hi>Mercury</hi> is too cold to be given alone, and therefore you muſt add either the <hi>Cordial Powder</hi> or <hi>Treacle.</hi> And beſides, when 'tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alone it oftentimes cauſes a Diſturbance without any Evacuation; but the Swelling of the Body, that uſually happens on this Occaſion, may be eaſily aſſwag'd with a convenient <hi>Clyſter:</hi> However 'tis certain that it never produces any ill Effect when 'tis mixt with <hi>Cordials.</hi> It does not always purge, and ſometimes its Operation is not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble till the Horſe begins to thrive after the Deſtruction of thoſe pernicious <hi>Inſects</hi> that waſted him.

                     <p>THeſe <hi>Pills</hi> are of excellent Uſe for Horſes that are troubl'd with <hi>Worms,</hi> unleſs they be extremely lean and waſted, as indeed in that Caſe they uſually are, and therefore before you proceed to <hi>purge</hi> a lean Horſe, you muſt firſt moiſten his Body with wet <hi>Bran</hi> inſtead of <hi>Oats,</hi> or infuſe an Ounce of <hi>Polychreſt,</hi> and half an Ounce of <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> beaten, in a Quart of Wine, for the ſpace of one Night. Next Morning, give him the Wine luke-warm, continuing after the ſame manner for ſome Days: But if he forſake his Meat, you muſt lay aſide the Uſe of <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> for ſome time, and even entirely, if his Hair begin to ſtare; for from the Appearance of that Sign you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Horſe's Body is not over-heated, and that you may ſafely adminiſter the purging Remedy, if his Appetite be in a good Condition. <hi>Sal Polychreſt</hi> is certainly an admirable Remedy to <hi>prepare</hi> the Body of a Horſe for <hi>Purgation,</hi> when it does not take away his Appetite, and even ſometimes it kills the <hi>Worms:</hi> However you may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give theſe <hi>Pills</hi> with a confident Expectation of very good Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>Boil a Pound of <hi>Honey</hi> in a Skillet till it begin to thicken, then add an Ounce and a half of <hi>Wormſeed,</hi> and about two Ounces of <hi>Aloes</hi> in Powder, according to the Bigneſs of your Horſe, for you may give a <hi>Coach-Horſe</hi> two Ounces and a half; and if he be of a very large Size, three Ounces. Boil the <hi>Powders</hi> with the <hi>Honey</hi> till they be well incorporated, and after the Maſs is cold, make it up into <hi>Pills,</hi> anointing your Hands with <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> or of <hi>bitter Almonds,</hi> if you can procure it; keeping your Horſe bridl'd ſix Hours before you give him the Pills, and as long after.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Day give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of two Quarts of <hi>Milk,</hi> with a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and ſix <hi>Yolks</hi> of <hi>Eggs,</hi> to entice the <hi>Worms</hi> to the <hi>Fundament. Note,</hi> That you muſt never mix any <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Fat</hi> with the <hi>Clyſters</hi> that are given in this Caſe, for they both drive away the <hi>Worms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They who are loth to give themſelves the Trouble of preparing theſe <hi>Pills,</hi> may give their Horſes one of the above-mention'd <hi>Purgatives,</hi> eſpecially that with <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> which will certainly anſwer their Expectation. But I have often obſerv'd, that theſe <hi>Pills</hi> have extirpated all the <hi>Worms</hi> out of a Horſe's Body, more effectually than any other Remedy whatſover.</p>
                     <p>The following Method is alſo of admirable Efficacy. Boil three Quarts of Water in an Earthen Pot, with half a Pound of running or crude <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> and mix this Water with a Pailful of common Water for your Horſe's ordinary Drink, during the ſpace of fifteen Days. The ſame <hi>Mercury</hi> will ſerve all the while, and remain as good after the fifteen Days are expir'd, as it was at the firſt Boiling. This Remedy was firſt propos'd by <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> and I have ſeen it given to Children that were full of <hi>Worms,</hi> for fifteen Days together, with admirable Succeſs. 'Tis not at all loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or troubleſome to the Stomach, for the <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> changes neither the Colour, Taſte, nor Smell of the Water. I have ſeen an infinite Number of Cures perform'd by it, and therefore I cou'd not forbear inſerting it here for the Conveniency of the Poor, who cannot make uſe of a cheaper Remedy. Others put two or three Pounds of <hi>crude Quick-ſilver</hi> into the bottom of a Cask where they keep Water for the ordinary Drink of Horſes that are troubl'd with <hi>Worms.</hi>

                           <hi>Another Remedy to kill</hi> Worms.</head>
                        <p>Give your Horſe daily an Ounce of <hi>Filings of Steel</hi> (which you may procure at very eaſie Rates from the <hi>Needle-Makers</hi>) mixt with <hi>moiſten'd Bran,</hi> till he has eaten a whole Pound. I will not here repeat what I have already ſaid, in order to explain the Reaſon why <hi>Steel</hi> deſtroys and expels <hi>Worms;</hi> but it will not be improper to add, that it opens all Obſtructions in the <hi>Veins, Arteries, Inteſtins,</hi> and eſpecially in the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Lungs:</hi> And 'tis well known, that if thoſe Obſtructions be neglected, they may produce many dangerous and ſtubborn Diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>'Tis, in my Opinion, very convenient, when Horſes return from the Camp, to put 'em into a Courſe of <hi>Steel,</hi> obſerving the ſame Doſe as before: For it happens not unfrequently that they are troubl'd with <hi>Worms,</hi> which hinder 'em from thriving; tho' their Diſtemper, by reaſon of the want of external Signs, is generally unknown, and conſequently either neglected, or ill cur'd. But all theſe Inconveniencies may be prevented by the Uſe of <hi>Steel,</hi> which is a cheap Remedy, and ſafe in all Caſes. To ſecure and complete the Effect of the <hi>Steel,</hi> you muſt afterwards <hi>purge</hi> your Horſe; for without <hi>Purgation,</hi> you can never certainly promiſe the Cure of this Diſtemper.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLX. <hi>Of</hi> Swaying of the Back, <hi>and</hi> Falls.</head>
                     <p>SOmetimes Horſes <hi>fall</hi> with ſo much Violence, or in ſo dangerous a Poſture, that the <hi>Ligaments, Tendons,</hi> and <hi>Sinews,</hi> are ſtrain'd, or a <hi>Vein</hi> broken within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and the Blood being extravaſated in ſome part of the lower Belly or <hi>Paunch,</hi> curdles, and aafterwards putrefying, produces very troubleſome and dangerous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The <hi>Back</hi> may be as dangerouſly <hi>ſway'd</hi> or ſtrain'd by a <hi>Fall</hi> catch'd in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as if the Horſe had fall'n from a high Place; for the Strength of the Back is quite deſtroy'd, when the <hi>Ligaments</hi> that keep the Bones firm are ſtretch'd or relax'd.</p>
                     <p>The Circumſtances of the Fall are either viſible to the Eye, or may be learn'd from the Relation of others; ſometimes the Horſe voids Blood at his Mouth or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils; he cannot go without a great deal of Trouble, and there is a manifeſt Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his hinder Parts: From whence you may conclude, that his <hi>Back</hi> is either <hi>broken</hi> or <hi>ſway'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſureſt Sign of the <hi>Swaying of the Bach,</hi> is when a Horſe cannot move back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, eſpecially in going up a ſteep Place, by reaſon of the Weakneſs of his Back, and the Pain which he feels. <hi>Mules</hi> are more ſubject to theſe Accidents than <hi>Horſes,</hi> both becauſe they uſually bear greater Burthens, and becauſe the Ridge of their Back is higher, and not ſo firmly ſupported by their Ribs, as the ſame Part is in a Horſe, whoſe Ribs are ſo plac'd that they ſerve as a kind of Buttreſſes to defend his Back from Strains. For the Cure of this Diſtemper you muſt immediately bleed your Horſe in the <hi>Neck-Veins,</hi> taking away about two Pounds of Blood; and having chaf'd his Back with your Hand till it grow warm, apply two large <hi>Cupping-Glaſſes,</hi> one on each Side, in the Place where he ſeems to complain moſt of Pain, ſcarifying the Part about the <hi>Cupping-Glaſſes,</hi> to let out the extravaſated Blood, and recal the natural Heat, to prevent the flowing of the Humours, and extinguiſh the extraneous or adventitious Heat, caus'd by the Breaking or Straining of the Back: Then put your Horſe in a Frame, and hang him up; or if you cannot procure a Frame, incloſe him with Grates in the Stable, that he may not be able to move his Body. Let him remain in that Poſture five or ſix Weeks, that the Remedies may have time to operate, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may take the Advantage of their Aſſiſtance, which ſhe cou'd not do if the Horſe were ſuffer'd to move his Body.</p>
                     <p>Then take equal Quantities of <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> ſhake 'em together in a Vial till they grow white as Milk; and with this Mixture anoint your Horſe's Back, rubbing it in with your Hand; after which apply the <hi>Red Honey-Charge,</hi> laying it on hot, and adding half an Ounce of <hi>Galls</hi> at every Application: Repeat the ſame every time, applying a freſh <hi>Charge,</hi> without taking away the former. In the mean time you muſt not be ſurpriz'd at the Swelling of the Back, for that is an Effect of the Operation of the Remedy; you muſt afterwards proceed to waſh the Back with a <hi>Bath</hi> of proper Herbs, ſuch as was preſcrib'd for <hi>batter'd</hi> and <hi>decay'd Legs,</hi> in the <hi>ſixty fifth</hi> Chapter, applying two warm Napkins moiſten'd in the Decoction, with a Cloth over all, according to the Directions mention'd in the ſame Chapter, and repeating the <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Fomentation</hi> ſix times, once every Day. This is the true Method of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying external Remedies, only 'tis to be obſerv'd, that they who have not the

                           <hi>Note;</hi> That theſe <hi>Potions</hi> are not neceſſary for all Strains of the Back, but only when the Fall is very dangerous, or when there is a Vein broken within the Horſe's Body; which you may know by his voiding Blood at the Mouth or Noſe. If the Strain of the Back be not accompany'd with any apparent Sign of the Rupture of a Vein, or great internal Contuſion; for Example, when the Horſe does not void Blood by the Mouth or Noſe, but is only troubl'd with a Reeling in his hinder Parts, when he trots, and a difficulty of ſtepping backwards, it will be ſufficient for the Cure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Mixture of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> a good <hi>Red Honey-Charge,</hi> or the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> and afterwards convenient <hi>Baths</hi> and <hi>Fomentations</hi> according to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Directions.

                        <p>If the former <hi>Potion</hi> be not altogether ſo effectual as you expect or deſire, you muſt bleed your Horſe again, and then give him the following <hi>Potion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take of common <hi>Oil</hi> half a Pint, Seeds of <hi>Creſſes</hi> in Powder, an Ounce, or an Ounce and a half, if the Horſe be of a large Size, <hi>Bole Armenic,</hi> and <hi>Mummy,</hi> of each half an Ounce. Make a Potion, to be given to the Horſe aſſoon as you perceive that his Back is ſtrain'd, and apply the <hi>Oils</hi> and <hi>Ointment</hi> of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Powder of <hi>Galls,</hi> after which <hi>bathe</hi> and <hi>foment</hi> as before.</p>
                        <p>Some pretend to cure a Strain in the Back in the Summer, by making the Horſe ſwim; but this Method is not ſufficient for the Cure of great or violent Strains.</p>
                        <p>You muſt take Care not to ride your Horſe immediately after his Recovery; for tho' he be not lame, the leaſt Excerciſe will put him in a worſe Condition than before, if you allow not a ſufficient Time for the Back to recover its wonted Vigour. To avoid this Inconveniency, aſſoon as the Horſe ſeems to be ſound, 'twill be convenient to walk him to the Water, and not to take his Back for a Month, after the Cure of a violent Strain, and a ſpace of Time proportionably leſs, for ſlight Strains; and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:179659:360"/>every Day when he returns from walking chafe his Back with good <hi>Brandy</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Horſe be not cur'd by the Application of the above-mention'd Remedies, as it happens not unfrequently, you muſt ſeparate the Skin from the Fleſh, on the <hi>Reins</hi> or lower part of the <hi>Back,</hi> that is behind the Saddle which I ſuppoſe to be little, for a large Saddle covers a great part of the <hi>Reins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You muſt, I ſay make two or three Inciſions on each ſide, with a large Iron Slice, and ſeparate the Skin about the breadth of half a Foot on each ſide of the Back-Bone, till you come to the Hip-Bone: Then ſtop the Holes with Slices of <hi>Hog's-Lard,</hi> of the thickneſs of half a Crown, and two or three Fingers breadth long and broad, to hinder the Skin from growing to the Fleſh. Rub the ſeparated Skin with an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of equal parts of <hi>Populeum,</hi> and the <hi>Ointment of Marſh-Mallows,</hi> covering the whole Part with a Lamb's-Skin, the woolly ſide inwards, and laying a Saddle-Cloth over all. Then hang up the Horſe, or fix him in ſuch a Poſture, that he may not be able to ſtir, and at Night give him a <hi>Clyſter</hi> of <hi>Sal-Polychreſt,</hi> repeating the ſame every Day for eight Days together, and in the mean time give him at the Mouth, once a Day, an Ounce of <hi>Aſſa-foetida,</hi> in Powder, mixt with a Pint of Wine.</p>
                        <p>After forty eight Hours uncover the ſore place, and you will find it very much ſwoll'n, as it muſt be in order to the Cure. Take out the ſlices of <hi>Lard,</hi> and preſs out the reddiſh Water and Matter that are in the Sore; putting in freſh ſlices of <hi>Lard,</hi> and chaſing the whole Part with an Ointment made of <hi>Populeum,</hi> and the <hi>Ointment of Marſh-Mallows.</hi> Then cover it up as before, and dreſs it after the ſame manner once in forty eight Hours for the ſpace of twelve Days; after which you muſt not put any ſlices of <hi>Lard</hi> into it, but only dreſs it with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> keeping it cover'd, and dreſſing it every Day, till the Skin be re-united to the Fleſh, and the Sores heal'd. Ten Days after you begin to lay aſide the uſe of the ſlices of <hi>Lard,</hi> take away the Lamb's-Skin, for the Cure ought to be compleated in that time; but the Horſe muſt not ſtir for ten Days longer, or thirty two Days after the beginning of the Cure; after which you may walk him a little, obſerving whether he continues to halt, then lead him to the Water, and accuſtom him to Travel by degrees.</p>
                        <p>Or inſtead of ſeparating the Skin, you may, if you think fit, <hi>give the Fire,</hi> piercing the Skin with a red-hot Iron, and making holes all over the ſame Part, at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an Inch from each other. Then apply a good <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> and over that two Sheets of <hi>Paper;</hi> after which <hi>hang up</hi> your Horſe, or fix him ſo that he may not be able to move for the ſpace of a Month. When the Scabs are fall'n, dreſs the Sores with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> and proceed as before. Theſe are the laſt Remedies in this caſe; ſome prefer the latter before the former; but 'tis my Opinion that they are equally good, if the Operation be duly perform'd; tho' I muſt confeſs the laſt is the eaſieſt.</p>

Theſe Strains are occaſion'd by Slips or Falls; and the Bone that joyns the Thigh to the Body is oftentimes diſlocated, or remov'd out of its right place; at other times the Humour contain'd in that Part, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Nature for facilitating the motion of the Joint, either falls out or hardens, and conſequently cauſes Pain, and binders the motion of the <hi>Hip-Bone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Hip-Bone</hi> be extreamly relax'd, or put out of its place, you may feel the hollow Part where the Bone was, with your hand, or perceive it with your Eye, as the Horſe moves his Legs: He is alſo extreamly Lame, and cannot ſuſtain the weight of his Body upon the griev'd Leg. In theſe caſes 'tis the uſual cuſtom of <hi>Farriers</hi> to tye one end of a Leathern Thong about the Horſe's <hi>Paſtern,</hi> and the other to an yielding Buſh or Shrub, and then by whipping the Horſe, to make him ſtruggle with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:179659:361"/>all his force till the Bone return to its proper place. This Method is not only rarely ſucceſsful, but very dangerous, if it be not perform'd with a great deal of Judgment and Circumſpection, and by a very ſagacious and underſtanding Perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twill be ſafer to obſerve the following Directions.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place (and even tho' the former Operation has already been perform'd with ſucceſs) chafe the griev'd Part with a mixture of <hi>Oil of Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> rubbing it in with your Hand; and two Hours after apply the <hi>Ointment of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier.</hi> The next Day bleed your Horſe, and two Hours after chafe the part with the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> and then with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> two Hours after the Application of the <hi>Eſſences</hi> as before. At Night, if there be occaſion, chafe the Part again with the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> and as ſoon as they have perform'd their Operation, that is, when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Pain is over by the Horſe's ceaſing to complain, cover the griev'd Hip, with a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> made of <hi>Roſin, Maſtic, Olibanum</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> with a large quantity of <hi>Burgundy-Pitch</hi> melted together, and apply'd moderately hot, laying Saddle-ſtuffings over it, and putting a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the contrary Foot to make the Horſe lean on the ſore ſide. He muſt not be ſuffer'd to lye down till the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> fall off, after which make a convenient <hi>Bath</hi> for his Hips.</p>
                     <p>If the Strain be not very conſiderable, apply the ſame Remedies that were preſcrib'd for <hi>Shoulder-ſprains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be only a relaxation of the <hi>Ligaments</hi> and <hi>Muſcles,</hi> after you have bled your Horſe in the Neck, apply the <hi>Eſſences, Honey-Charges, Baths,</hi> and <hi>Fomentations,</hi> preſcrib'd for <hi>Shoulder-ſprains</hi> in the Fifty fourth and Fifty ſixth Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Directions may be illuſtrated with the following Example. A Horſe who had halted ſo long of a Strain in the <hi>Hip,</hi> that his <hi>Hip</hi> and <hi>Thigh</hi> began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay for want of Nouriſhment, was cur'd even in <hi>Winter,</hi> (which is a conſiderable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, for the Cure is more difficult in that Seaſon than in <hi>Summer</hi>) without the Application of any other Remedy than the above-mention'd <hi>Honey-Charge, Baths,</hi> and <hi>Fomentations;</hi> but the Part was firſt chaf'd with a Mixture of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oil of Turpentine,</hi> and the <hi>Charge</hi> that was laid over it ſerv'd for a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> to concentrate the Virtue of the <hi>Oil,</hi> and keep it from evaporating.</p>
                     <p>If all theſe Remedies be apply'd without Succeſs, you muſt give Nature time to work: But if, after all, you perceive no Amendment, you muſt proceed to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> which is the laſt refuge in this caſe, and ought never to be attempted till after a ſucceſsleſs Application of other Remedies. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that ſome Pretenders to Skill in the cure of Horſes, imagine the Grief to be ſeated in the Bone at the top of the <hi>Rump,</hi> tho' 'tis certain, that there is not any <hi>Joint</hi> in that place, and therefore 'tis in vain to apply a Remedy to a ſound Part. The <hi>Joint</hi> is almoſt at the ſide of the Root of the <hi>Tail</hi> near the middle of the <hi>Thigh;</hi> and when the Bone is diſlocated, or only relax'd, you may diſtinctly perceive a hollowneſs in the Part, when the Horſe goes, and even if you lay your Hand on the two Joints on each ſide, and make the Horſe walk gently, you will immediately feel at every ſtep, that the griev'd Joint is hollower than that on the other ſide, and conſequently you may conclude, that the Grief is ſeated there without ridiculouſly endeavouring to find it out at the top of the Rump where there never was a <hi>Joint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>giving of the Fire,</hi> draw a Line with a red-hot Knife round the Joint or place where you obſerve the Motion, making a Circle of the largeneſs of a great Plate, the Joint being in the center. This Line muſt only burn the Hair, for it ſerves meerly to mark the place that muſt be burnt. Then make holes in the Skin, at the diſtance of an Inch from each other, thro' the whole ſpace, enclos'd with the round Line, cover them with a good Plaiſter, and over that lay a ſufficient quantity of Saddle-ſtuffings or Shavings of Cloth; ſet a <hi>Patten-Shooe</hi> on the other Foot, to make the Horſe lean on the griev'd ſide, and keep him ſtill in one place, without ſuffering him to lye down for the ſpace of fifteen or twenty Days. When the Scabs fall off dreſs the Sores with <hi>Brandy;</hi> and after you have kept the Horſe thirty Days in the ſame Poſture, you may begin to walk him by degrees, and ſome time after to ride him gently. Since the <hi>Fire</hi> is a powerful <hi>Reſolvent,</hi> it will conſume and diſſipate the Humours that occaſion the Lameneſs, and reſtore the Part to its wonted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                     <p>If the Swelling of the <hi>Hip</hi> deſcend to the <hi>Hough,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Legs,</hi> you muſt let your Horſe Blood in the <hi>Toe,</hi> and charge his <hi>Legs</hi> with the above-mention'd <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> or anoint 'em with the <hi>Greaſe</hi> of a <hi>Mule, Bear,</hi> or <hi>Camel.</hi> You may quickly perceive the effect of theſe Remedies, if you take care in the mean time to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:179659:361"/>walk your Horſe gently from time to time. <hi>Badger's-Greaſe</hi> produces the ſame effect: And the <hi>Marrow</hi> of a <hi>Stag,</hi> and <hi>Gooſe-Greaſe,</hi> are alſo very proper in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Strain</hi> affects only the great <hi>Sinew</hi> that runs along by the <hi>Vein</hi> on the inſide of the <hi>Thigh,</hi> as you may eaſily perceive by the Swelling, Diſtention, Pain, and Heat of the <hi>Sinew.</hi> In this caſe you muſt let your Horſe Blood in the <hi>Neck,</hi> and charge the Part with his own <hi>Blood</hi> mixt with <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> after which you may compleat the Cure with proper <hi>Charges</hi> and <hi>Baths.</hi> The above-mention'd <hi>Greaſes</hi> are alſo very uſeful; as likewiſe the <hi>Ointments</hi> for the <hi>Sinews,</hi> and other <hi>Ointments</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for the ſtrengthning of the <hi>Fore-Legs.</hi> Or you may apply the <hi>Baron's Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Oppodeldoc,</hi> which is certainly one of the beſt Remedies not only in this Book, but even perhaps in all the Treatiſes that are extant on this Subject.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXII. <hi>Of the Swelling of the</hi> Cods <hi>and</hi> Stones.</head>
                     <p>THE Swelling of the <hi>Cods</hi> or <hi>Stones</hi> may proceed from ſeveral Cauſes. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſtuff'd with ſerous Humours that deſcend along the production of the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> ſometimes the Defluxion is occaſion'd by the ſtroke of another Horſe, and not unfrequently the <hi>Guts</hi> fall into the <hi>Cods,</hi> by reaſon of ſome Strain or Wrench.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the uſual cuſtom in this caſe to ride the Horſe into the Water, which, by its coldneſs, repels the Humour that flows to the <hi>Cods;</hi> and if they be only full of <hi>Wind,</hi> or diſtended with a ſlight Inflammation, this Method may be attended with Succeſs; But if the Inflammation be violent, you muſt apply the following <hi>Pultiſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="section">

                           <hi>A</hi> Pultiſs.</head>
                        <p>Take <hi>Yellow-Wax, freſh Butter,</hi> and <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> of each half a Pound; ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> half a Pint; boil 'em together till the <hi>Vinegar</hi> be almoſt conſum'd; then remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and adding an Ounce of <hi>Camphire</hi> in Powder, make a <hi>Pultiſs</hi> to be apply'd to the ſwoll'n <hi>Cods.</hi> Four Hours after lay on a freſh <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> without taking away the former, or covering the Part. If it be a ſimple Imflammation the Swelling will be aſſwag'd, and the Pain abated: But if the Swelling continue after the Heat and Pain are remov'd, the <hi>Cods</hi> hanging down very low, 'tis a ſign that the Horſe is troubl'd with a <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> that is, when by a relaxation of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> the <hi>Cods</hi> are fill'd with Water, which being too long retain'd in the Part, by reaſon of the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of expelling it thro' the Pores, may corrupt and ulcerate the <hi>Stones,</hi> and at laſt occaſion a fatal <hi>Grangrene.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To prevent theſe Diſaſters, after the Heat and Inflammation is abated by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> apply that which follows; and if that alſo prove ineffectual, and the <hi>Stones</hi> continue to hang very low; and if by feeling the <hi>Cods</hi> you have reaſon to believe they contain a great deal of Water, you muſt <hi>Geld</hi> your Horſe at the <hi>Full-Moon.</hi> As ſoon as you make the Inciſion, there will come out a Pint or two of <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Water,</hi> which caus'd the Swelling; and if the Operation be dexterouſly perform'd, the Wound may be eaſily heal'd, if the <hi>Stones</hi> were not already ulcerated.</p>

                        <p>I knew a very induſtrious <hi>Groom</hi> who invented a kind of <hi>Truſſes</hi> for <hi>Burſten</hi> Horſes, by the help of which they were able to Travel without any Pain or Incommodity; and I have even ſeen ſome Horſes leap very well with this <hi>Truſs,</hi> who were not able to leap once without it. When the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> or <hi>Rim</hi> that holds up the Intrals is relax'd, the <hi>Guts</hi> fall into the <hi>Cods,</hi> and their deſcent appears viſibly to the Eye: In this caſe you muſt endeavour to put up the fall'n Guts with your Hands, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the following <hi>Fomentation.</hi> If you cannot put up the Guts, you muſt caſt the Horſe on ſoft Ground, and make him lye flat on his Back, with his two Legs on each ſide bound together; then having bath'd his <hi>Stones</hi> with luke-warm Water, put up the Guts with your Hand, and in the mean time prepare the following <hi>Quilt,</hi> which muſt be ready againſt the Horſe riſes again.</p>
                        <p>Take the Roots of <hi>Comfrey,</hi> the Bark of the <hi>Pomgranate</hi> and <hi>Oak-Trees, Cyprus-Nuts,</hi> and green <hi>Oak-Apples, Sumach,</hi> and <hi>Barberries,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Annis</hi> and <hi>Fennel-ſeed,</hi> of each two Ounces; Flowers of <hi>Pomgranates, Camomil,</hi> and <hi>Melilot,</hi> of each two handfuls; Powder of crude <hi>Allom,</hi> half a Pound. Put 'em altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bag large enough to cover the <hi>Cods,</hi> and ſew it after the manner of a <hi>Quilt.</hi> Then put this Bag, with half a Peck of Beans into a large Pot full of Wine made of <hi>Sloes,</hi> or for want of that of thick Red-Wine, and boil 'em for the ſpace of two Hours; after which apply it moderately hot to the <hi>Stones,</hi> tying it on dexterouſly with a Bandage paſſing round the Flanks, and ty'd on the Rump. Continue the uſe of this Remedy for a conſiderable time, and every twenty four Hours heat the <hi>Quilt</hi> in the ſame Wine.</p>
                        <p>But after you have put up the Guts, the ſureſt and even the eaſieſt way is to <hi>Geld</hi> the Horſe, for ſo the Cods ſhrink up, and the Guts fall no more down into 'em.</p>
                        <p>This Remedy is alſo of good uſe for the diſſolving all ſorts of Swellings.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Baths</hi> preſcrib'd in the following Chapters for a <hi>Flux</hi> or Looſneſs, of the Belly, are very effectually in this caſe, if the <hi>Cods</hi> be afterwards fomented.</p>

                     <p>SOmetimes a Horſe intangling himſelf among the Bars that are ſet up to ſeparate him from other Horſes, and ſtrugling vehemently to diſingage himſelf, his Stones are cruſh'd and bruis'd, and Matter is afterward generated in 'em, by reaſon of the defluxion of the Humours. Sometimes the Stone grows dry and hard as Wood, becauſe of the preternatural Heat occaſion'd by the Contuſion, which is ſtill more dangerous, if it be accompany'd with an Inflammation. The Diſeaſe may be alſo ſeated in the Ligaments, in which caſe the Humours fall down upon 'em, and produce dangerous conſequences.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the uſual Cuſtom to <hi>Geld</hi> Horſes that have the misfortune to meet with ſuch Accidents; but that ought not to be done till the Pain be aſſwag'd, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion ſtopt. And beſides the dangerouſneſs of the Operation, at certain Seaſons of the Year, and the ill effect it produces on <hi>manag'd Horſes,</hi> it cannot be ſuppos'd,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:179659:362"/>that the cauſe of the Diſtemper can be remov'd by this Method, when the Humours fall upon the Ligaments by which the Stone hangs: For the hardneſs and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ligaments muſt be taken away before the Operation can be ſucceſsfully perform'd, nor muſt it ever be attempted till after a fruitleſs Application of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remedies.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>A very excellent Remedy.</head>
                        <p>Take <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>freſh Butter</hi> melted, of each half a Pound; Juice of <hi>green Coleworts,</hi> a Pound; Leaves of <hi>Rue,</hi> freed from the Stalks, a large handful; <hi>Black-Soap,</hi> a quarter of a Pound; <hi>Bean-Flower,</hi> a Pound; Stamp the <hi>Rue</hi> in a Marble-Mortar, then add the <hi>Honey,</hi> and afterwards the Juice of <hi>Coleworts, Butter,</hi> and <hi>Black-Soap;</hi> mix 'em di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently without Heat, and make a <hi>Pultiſs</hi> with <hi>Bean-Flower,</hi> which muſt be apply'd cold with a Hog's-Bladder, and kept on with a Bandage ty'd about the Horſe's Back. Thus even hard Swellings may be cur'd, if the Dreſſing be renew'd once a Day; and the quantity here preſcrib'd may ſerve to perfect the Cure by repeated Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the Diſeaſe be not very dangerous and ſtubborn.</p>
                        <p>If the Swelling be accompany'd with a great Inflammation, add to the whole Compoſition two Drams of <hi>Camphire,</hi> diſſolv'd in three Spoonfuls of <hi>Spirit of Wine:</hi> But if the Tumor or Inflammation be ſeated in the Ligaments that is above the Stone, chafe the Part with <hi>Spirit of Wine Camphorated,</hi> and afterwards apply the <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> or <hi>Pultiſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have reaſon to believe, that there is Matter generated in the Stone, ſpread a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum</hi> on very ſoft Leather, to make a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> about the largeneſs of the Palm of your Hand, and lay it upon the Part where the Matter ſeems to be ſeated: Then apply the <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> and if the Matter be either actually generated, or ready to be form'd, the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> will draw it. The <hi>Plaiſter</hi> muſt be taken off once a Day and wip'd, but needs not be chang'd: And, by perſiſting in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, you may Cure the Horſe without <hi>Gelding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You muſt let him Blood in the beginning, and at the end of the Cure, and give him two Ounces of <hi>Sal-Prunellae</hi> every Day mixt with <hi>Bran,</hi> which muſt be his only Food. This Remedy promotes the Cure, by cooling the inward Parts, and allaying the preternatural heat of the Bowels, occaſion'd by the Communication and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the bruis'd Stone.</p>
                        <p>But ſince it happens not unfrequently, that the Matter appears ſo high above the Stone, that it cannot be conveniently evacuated, and you have reaſon to fear, that it may fall into the Cods, and there putrefie, you muſt open a paſſage with a red-hot Iron at the bottom of the Cod, without touching the Stone: Then anoint the Cod with <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> and lay over it <hi>Beet-Leaves,</hi> ſmear'd with <hi>Butter,</hi> putting into the Hole a Tent anointed with <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum,</hi> melted in <hi>Oil of Roſes,</hi> or, for want of that, in common <hi>Oil-Olive.</hi> Continue after the ſame manner, and your Horſe will certainly recover without <hi>Gelding.</hi> This is an excellent Remedy to ripen Matter in any part of the Body where the Skin is broken, and when the circumſtances of the Diſeaſe require the Sore to be kept open.</p>
                        <p>You may apply either of theſe Remedies, according to the greatneſs of the Swelling.</p>
                        <p>

                     <p>THis Diſeaſe is ſo frequently Mortal, I mean when it attacks Horſes, that it ought never to be neglected, when it comes without a manifeſt Cauſe. But a Horſe may be ſeiz'd with a <hi>Looſeneſs,</hi> without any conſiderable Danger, after the drinking of cold Water in Summer, or of melted Snow, and after the eating of tender Graſs, or other Aliments and Medicines, that may be rather ſaid to produce a good Effect, by looſening the Horſe's Belly, and expelling part of the Impurities that are lodg'd in his Body: But this is not the Diſeaſe treated of in this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lask</hi> or <hi>Flux</hi> is caus'd by the Weakneſs of the Stomach, that cannot digeſt the Nouriſhment, which conſequently paſſes thro' the Guts, and is voided at the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment almoſt without any Alteration.</p>
                     <p>It proceeds alſo from the Corruption of the Humours that are either gather'd in the Stomach, or flow thither from the neighbouring Parts; and by diſturbing Nature in the Performance of her important Work of Concoction, provoke her to a vigorous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in order to their Expulſion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Humours are not always raw and cold; for oftentimes the Guts are ſcowr'd by an Inundation of <hi>Choler,</hi> which may be call'd a <hi>Natural Clyſter.</hi> This kind of Flux is rarely dangerous, and even not unfrequently profitable.</p>
                     <p>It is an ill Sign when the Aliments are voided entire, without the leaſt Mark of Digeſtion: For 'tis abſolutely impoſſible for Nature to repair her Loſſes, and regain her wonted Vigour, without freſh Supplies of Nouriſhment; and 'tis plain that ſhe receives not any conſiderable Advantage from the Nouriſhment, when it only paſſes thro' the Body without undergoing any Change.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe Internal Cauſes, this Diſtemper may be occaſion'd by eating too much Provender, in which Caſe it may be eaſily cur'd, by diminiſhing the uſual Allowance of Food. Sometimes 'tis caus'd by eating mouldy or rotten Hay, frozen Graſs, and other unwholſome Nouriſhment; as alſo by drinking very cold Water, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and fatiguing Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper may alſo proceed from want of Exerciſe, drinking immediately after the eating of a great quantity of <hi>Oats,</hi> exceſſive Fatneſs, feeding on <hi>Rye</hi> Straw, and an ill Diſpoſition of the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>To diſcover the Nature of the Humour that cauſes and foments the Diſeaſe, you muſt conſider the Excrements that are voided; for if they boil and ferment upon the Ground, you may conclude that the Diſtemper proceeds from over-heated <hi>Choler;</hi> if they be white, 'tis a Sign of <hi>Crudity;</hi> if they be watery, they denote a great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Stomach.</hi>

                           <hi>A Remedy for the</hi> Flux.</head>
                        <p>If the Excrements be mixt with ſmall Pieces or Scrapings of the Guts, you have reaſon to fear an Ulcer in thoſe Parts, which uſually proves fatal, if the Danger be not ſpeedily prevented by a ſeaſonable Cooling of the Entrails, which may be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Barley</hi> and the Roots of <hi>Marſh-Mallows</hi> beaten, of each two Ounces, Powder of <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> an Ounce; Boil 'em in three Quarts of Water to one Quart. The Doſe is a Pint, two or three times a day. This Decoction allays the Inflammation of the Entrails, ſweetens the Acrimony of the Humors, reduces the Choler to its natural State, and deſtroys the preternatural Heat that occaſions the Fever.</p>
                        <p>If this Diſtemper be caus'd by <hi>Flegm,</hi> you muſt ſtrengthen the Stomach, evacuate the redundant Humours, and bind and ſtrengthen the relax'd Parts. Theſe Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require the Uſe of the <hi>Cordial-Powder</hi> or <hi>Pills,</hi> the <hi>Electuary of Kermes, Treacle,</hi> and other hot Remedies that are endu'd with a Virtue to ſtrengthen and corroborate the Parts. The Cure of this kind of <hi>Flux</hi> is eaſier than in the other Caſes.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> of the Belly, or <hi>Flux,</hi> is frequently an Effect of a vigorous ſtruggle of Nature, to throw off and expel a troubleſome Load of Humours: But if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer than three Days, and be attended with the Loſs of Appetite, it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:179659:363"/>dangerous Conſequences; for ſometimes Horſes are founder'd by the long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Diſtemper: Therefore you muſt endeavour to prevent the Danger, by the ſeaſonable Application of convenient Remedies, and by keeping the Horſe to a regular Diet.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not ſuffer your Horſe to eat <hi>Oats,</hi> but feed him with <hi>Bran</hi> moiſten'd with <hi>Claret,</hi> if he have not too ſtrong an Averſion againſt it. <hi>Barley</hi> parch'd on a Peel at the Fire, and then ground, is very good in this Caſe; and you muſt alſo chuſe the beſt <hi>Hay.</hi>

Give your a Horſe a Pint of it with a Horn, (heating it luke-warm in Winter) and repeat the Doſe every ſix Hours, keeping him bridl'd an Hour before, and as long after. You may make the Remedy a great deal more effectual, by adding to each Quart of the Liquor a Dram of <hi>Anniſeeds,</hi> and the like Quantity of <hi>Coriander-ſeeds,</hi> both beaten to Powder.

This Malady ought never to be neglected, for it may be attended with dangerous Conſequences; and therefore you muſt anoint the Place with <hi>Oil of Roſes</hi> blood-warm, and afterwards endeavour to put it up. But if you perceive no Amendment, after two or three ſucceſsleſs Attempts, you muſt have recourſe to the following Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Beat ſix Drams of <hi>Salt of Lead</hi> with half a Pint of <hi>Goat's-Milk,</hi> or (for want of that) of <hi>Cow's-Milk,</hi> till they be well incorporated: You muſt firſt beat the <hi>Salt of Lead</hi> in a Mortar, and pour on the <hi>Milk</hi> by Degrees, beating and mixing 'em toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the while, till they be reduc'd to the Thickneſs, of a <hi>liquid Ointment.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Salt of Lead</hi> imbibes a larger quantity of <hi>Milk,</hi> than at other times, and therefore you muſt pour into the Mortar only what is ſufficient to bring it into the above-mention'd Form: Put a Tent into the <hi>Fundament,</hi> dipt in this <hi>Ointment,</hi> and anoint all the Part with it, repeating the Application from time to time.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that when the <hi>Falling of the Fundament</hi> is occaſion'd by the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the Tail, and accompany'd with a great Swelling, the Horſe is in a very dangerous Condition; for 'tis almoſt always a Sign of a <hi>Gangrene</hi> in the Tail, that ſpreads towards the Back: And therefore after a ſucceſsleſs Tryal of this Remedy, you may give him over for loſt.</p>

                        <p>If you cannot procure the <hi>green Bark,</hi> you may take the <hi>dry,</hi> diminiſhing the Doſe to two Ounces, and beating it to Powder.</p>

                        <p>It happens not unfrequently that the Diſtemper continues obſtinately after a fruitleſs Tryal of all theſe Applications. In this Caſe, aſſoon as the Inflammation and great Heat are remov'd, you muſt cut off the part of the <hi>Fundament</hi> that hangs out, with a ſharp Knife heated red-hot to prevent a Flux of Blood.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the <hi>Fundament</hi> ſhrinks into its Place, if the Horſe be ſuffer'd to reſt about half an Hour; But falls out again if you make him trot thirty Paces, which is a Sign of a <hi>Fiſtula:</hi> And therefore you muſt take hold of it when it falls out, and tying a ſtrong Packthread about it, cut it quite off with a red-hot Knife.</p>
                        <p>You muſt afterwards anoint the Wound every Day with <hi>Album-Rhaſis,</hi> till the Eſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and then rub the Fleſh with <hi>Siccativum Rubrum.</hi> Many Horſes have been ſav'd by this Method, and ſeveral Farriers at <hi>Paris</hi> have perform'd the Cure by my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who never ſaw it attempted before, tho' they are otherwiſe very skilful in their Profeſſion, and have ſeen Horſes cur'd of <hi>Fiſtula's.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>STrains</hi> in the <hi>Houghs</hi> are very dangerous, by reaſon of the extream Pain occaſion'd by the contuſion of the Nervous Parts: The Horſe's Body grows dry, he becomes Lean, and is afterwards troubl'd with ſo many grievous Diſtempers, that he grows ugly and deform'd, if not irrecoverably Lame.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are the ſame with thoſe that occaſion Strains in the Hips, and there is no need of enumerating a multitude of Signs in ſo plain a caſe: For the <hi>Hoof</hi> is ſwoll'n, and when you touch it the Horſe ſhrinks and complains.</p>
                     <p>Bleed your Horſe in the Neck, and charge the whole <hi>Hoof</hi> with his own <hi>Blood</hi> mixt with <hi>Brandy:</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Charge</hi> is dry, lay ſome of the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier</hi> above it, and about eight or ten Hours after chafe the Part with ſtrong <hi>Brandy,</hi> without taking away the <hi>Ointment,</hi> waſhing it always with <hi>Brandy,</hi> at the ſame Intervals after every Application of the <hi>Ointment.</hi> You may afterwards endeavour to repel the Defluxion with <hi>Aſtringent</hi> Remedies, ſuch as you will find deſcrib'd in ſeveral Parts of this Book, eſpecially the <hi>Aſtringent Baths</hi> mention'd in the preceding Chapter. If the Swelling continue, notwithſtanding the uſe of theſe Remedies, apply the <hi>Duke's Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with <hi>Brandy,</hi> and afterwards convenient <hi>Fomentations,</hi> renewing the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions once a Day. If the Swelling ripen or turn to an <hi>Abſceſs,</hi> open it with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot Iron, and proceed as in the Cure of <hi>Simple Wounds.</hi> For a ſlight Strain 'twill be ſufficient to anoint the <hi>Hoof</hi> with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelter</hi> and <hi>Brandy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Swelling be occaſion'd by a Blow from another Horſe, bleed your Horſe, Charge the griev'd place with his own Blood, and then chafe it with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or you may chuſe ſome of the following Remedies at your pleaſure.</p>

                           <hi>A Remedy for a</hi> Swelling <hi>caus'd by a</hi> Blow.</head>
                        <p>Mix a Pound of Flower of <hi>Linſeed,</hi> with a ſufficient quantity of Wine till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the thickneſs of Broth; boil it over a clear Fire, ſtirring it about without intermiſſion: When it begins to thicken add four Ounces of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and when that is well incorporated with the Broth, put in ſix Ounces of melted <hi>Burgundy-Pitch.</hi> Then remove the Veſſel from the Fire, continuing to ſtir the Compoſition till you can venture to put your Finger into it; after which you muſt immediately apply it to the place with Flax, and a Bandage, and repeat the Application once in twenty four Hours.</p>
                        <p>If the Swelling be accompany'd with a violent Pain, or if the Horſe be very Lame, you muſt endeavour to allay the Pain by the Application of the <hi>Duke's Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or, for want of that, of the preceding Remedy prepar'd with <hi>Milk</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wine.</hi> For the <hi>Milk</hi> is <hi>Anodyne,</hi> and aſſwages Pain, but is not endu'd with the reſolving Faculty of <hi>Wine;</hi> and therefore as ſoon as the Horſe ceaſes to Halt, you muſt again prepare the Remedy with Wine, to take away the Swelling.</p>
                        <p>If theſe Remedies be not attended with the deſir'd Succeſs, you may have recourſe to the <hi>Bath,</hi> mention'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> LXV. or to thoſe that are deſcrib'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Chapter;</hi> to which laſt you may add ſome of the Herbs that enter'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the former.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As ſoon as a Horſe has receiv'd a <hi>Blow</hi> in his Body with another Horſe's Foot, bleed him in the Neck, and bathe the place with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> five or ſix times every Day; or (which is more effectual) anoint it with the <hi>Ointment of Montpelier,</hi> and eight Hours after chafe it with <hi>Brandy,</hi> repeating the Application once a Day.</p>
                        <p>In theſe caſes I uſually apply, with very good Succeſs, the <hi>Creaſe</hi> of a <hi>Capon, Badger,</hi> or <hi>Bear,</hi> anointing the Part every Day till the Swelling be diſſolv'd.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXVIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Relaxation <hi>and</hi> Straining <hi>of the</hi> Maſter-Sinew.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Hough</hi> is ſurrounded with a great <hi>Sinew,</hi> which is divided from the Bone by a hollow ſpace where the <hi>Veſſigons</hi> are uſually ſeated. This is the biggeſt and moſt viſible <hi>Sinew</hi> in a Horſe's Body, which by reaſon of a Strain occaſion'd by hard Riding, evil Shooing, going down a ſteep place, a Slip or Fall, or too heavy Burthen, may be relax'd, and ſometimes diſtorted with ſo much Violence, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes moveable like an unbent Bow-ſtring. When a Horſe walks, the Leg ſeems to hang at the Hough, becauſe its Motion is not regulated by the <hi>Maſter-Sinew;</hi> and you wou'd even ſometimes imagine that the Bone was broken. When a Horſe ſtands with his Foot fix'd on the Ground, the Hough being extended in its natural Poſture, there is ſo little appearance of any Grief in the Leg, that it ſeems perfectly ſound, but if you handle the <hi>Maſter-Sinew</hi> you will find it more moveable than that of the other Leg; and if you make the Horſe move his hinder Parts, you will immediately perceive the Sinew to be as looſe and infirm as if it were broken.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen the <hi>Sinew</hi> ſo violently ſtrain'd, that 'twas plain from the beginning, that the Cure was impoſſible, tho' in the mean time the Horſe put his Foot to the Ground, and plac'd it as if he had been perfectly ſound; for 'tis only the lifting of his Foot when he goes, that diſcovers the Strain.</p>
                     <p>Some Horſes, contrary to the expectation of all who ſaw 'em, have been cur'd with the following Remedies; but the Cure of ſuch <hi>Strains</hi> is not the work of a little time.</p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:179659:366"/>
                     <p>'Tis a vulgar Error to imagine, that the Grief lies in the <hi>Hip;</hi> and I have even ſeen Farriers that were reputed skilful, who cou'd not be perſwaded, that the Diſtemper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Spraining of the <hi>Maſter-Sinew,</hi> affirming always, that the <hi>Hip-Bone</hi> was diſlocated; but time convinc'd 'em of their Ignorance; for after they had, by my Directions, obſerv'd the following Method, the Horſes were cur'd without any Application to the <hi>Hip-Bone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt bleed your Horſe in the Neck, put him in the Poſture deſcrib'd in the Cure of a <hi>ſway'd Back;</hi> and then prepare the following Remedy; but in the mean time 'tis to be obſerv'd, that he muſt not be ſuffer'd to eat <hi>Oats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of <hi>Comfrey</hi> and <hi>Marſh-Mallows,</hi> dry'd and groſsly beaten, of each two Ounces, or a double quantity of the green Roots: Boil em with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Claret</hi> in a clean and well-cover'd Earthen-Pot; and as ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow tender, add Leaves of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows, Hyſſop, Speedwel,</hi> and <hi>Sanicle,</hi> chopt ſmall, of each one handful; boil all together, pouring in freſh Wine if need require, to keep the Subſtances from burning. When you perceive that they are well ſoften'd, take 'em out of the Pot, beat 'em to a Maſh in a Stone-Mortar, and ſtrain 'em thro' a Hair-Sieve, after the ſame manner as <hi>Caſſia</hi> is uſually extracted. Then heat the ſtrain'd Matter with four Ounces of <hi>Badger's-Greaſe,</hi> applying it hot, and covering the Part very carefully with Flax, and an old Linnen-Cloth; but the place muſt be firſt anointed with the folowing Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oil of Roſes,</hi> two Ounces; <hi>Oil of Cammomil</hi> and <hi>Juniper,</hi> of each one Ounce; heat 'em in an Earthen Porringer, with two Drams of <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> in Powder; and as ſoon as the Compoſition grows luke-warm, anoint the place ſoftly; for this is a very penetrating Remedy, and better than that which the Farriers call the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> which is indeed a cheaper Medicine, but burns the Skin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the Part muſt be only anointed once in two Days, to prevent the danger of an Inflammation: And if, after all, you perceive by the Swelling of the Sinew, that theſe <hi>Oils</hi> produce too great a heat in the Part, you muſt only anoint it with warm <hi>Oil of Roſes,</hi> ſo long as the Inflammation continues.</p>
                     <p>As often as you renew the Dreſſing, lay a little freſh <hi>Pultiſs</hi> upon the old, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature or Bandage of theſe Parts is extreamly difficult; yet you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently bind on the Dreſſing with a piece of Liſt two Ells long, and an Inch broad; or rather ſow it on; for the ſowing does not occaſion the leaſt Swelling, and holds very well; and beſides, you may ſow it as cloſe or as looſe as you pleaſe. However, if you incline rather to a Bandage, you may conſult a Surgeon, who will ſhew you the manner of binding on the Dreſſing more plainly than 'tis poſſible for me to deſcribe it.</p>
                     <p>There is a particular Art in fitting a Bandage to the ſeveral Parts of the Body, and you muſt in this caſe make uſe of that which Surgeons call the <hi>Retentive</hi> Bandage; but you muſt take care not to bind the Part too hard; for 'tis better to be at the trouble of renewing the Bandage as often as it ſlackens.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Cure you muſt put your Horſe in a place where he may not be troubl'd with other Horſes, placing him in a kind of Frame, made with Grates and Poſts, that he may not be able to roll or move his hinder Parts. And you may even hang him, if you think fit, ſo as he may not be able to lye down; for if he were ſuffer'd to move his hinder Parts perpetually, the Cure wou'd be extreamly retarded.</p>
                     <p>By a careful obſervance of this Method you may cure the moſt dangerous <hi>Sinew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprain:</hi> And even tho' the Sinew were ſwoll'n as big as your Arm, I wou'd not uſe any other Remedy than what I have preſcrib'd, only the <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> muſt be omitted in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That when a <hi>Strain</hi> ſeems to be cur'd, inſtead of Riding your Horſe, you muſt <hi>give the Fire,</hi> beginning very high with a Stroke or Line in the middle of the Sinew, and two under it from the upper part of the Thigh, till you come under the top or elbow of the Hough, over againſt the uſual place of the <hi>Spavin;</hi> then burn the Part between thoſe Lines, making croſs Lines about a Finger's breadth diſtant from each other, till the Skin be of a bright Cherry Colour, but without piercing it. Then ſear the Thigh-Vein with a Star of Fire; and ſear the lower part of the ſame Vein with ſeveral Lines. Cover the burnt Parts with a good Plaiſter of <hi>Black-Pitch,</hi> and over that lay on Saddle-ſtuffings, or the ſhavings of Cloth. When the Scabs fall off
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:179659:366"/>waſh the Sores with good <hi>Brandy</hi> till they be dry, and afterwards walk your Horſe gently for ſome time before you begin to Travel him.</p>
                     <p>By this Method I cur'd a fine <hi>Barbary-Horſe,</hi> who was afterwards ſold for 500 Crowns, and continu'd very fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>The following Method is alſo very good, and requires not ſo much care as the other. Bleed your Horſe in the Neck, place him in a kind of Frame as before, and anoint the place with the above-mention'd <hi>Oils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſpread the <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLXXIV. on a very ſoft piece of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, large enough to cover the whole Hough, and over that fit on Splents of Paſt-board wrapt about with Flax, laying 'em length-wiſe on the <hi>Maſter-Sinew,</hi> to keep the whole Hough, and eſpecially that Sinew in its natural poſture. Bind on the Splents with three Ells of Inch-broad Lace, and afterwards put a lay of Flax over the Splents, and the whole Hough, with a Cloth over all, which muſt be dexterouſly ſow'd on with ſtrong Thread. Ten Days after untie the Bandage, and anoint the Parts with the above-mention'd <hi>Oils,</hi> and then apply a new <hi>Plaiſter, Splents, Flax,</hi> &amp;c. as before; renewing the Application every ten Days, without ſuffering the Horſe to ſtir till he be perfectly ſound, and the Sinew no longer moveable; after which you may proceed to <hi>give the Fire,</hi> according to the above-mention'd Directions. In the mean time 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that while the Part is bound up, you muſt pour ſome <hi>Oil of Roſes,</hi> and of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil</hi> from the top of the Thigh along the Sinew to moiſten the <hi>Plaiſter.</hi>

                     <p>You may eaſily reſtore decay'd and tyr'd Legs, by chaſing them twice a Day with this Remedy: It ſpeedily cures <hi>Pricks</hi> with a <hi>Nail</hi> in Shooing, or in the Street, <hi>Stubs;</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis alſo good for all manner of cold Pains and Aches, and is even of excellent uſe for Men.</p>
                     <p>You may, if you think fit, prepare only the half or fourth part of the quantity here preſcrib'd: But ſince 'tis an admirable Remedy for ſeveral Diſtempers, and can only be prepar'd at a certain Seaſon of the Year, when the Herbs that enter the Compoſition are in Flower, the beſt way is to prepare as great a quantity of it as your conveniency will permit.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Balſam</hi> is alſo good againſt <hi>Felanders,</hi> and all other extraneous and corrupt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that grow in Wounds or Sores, if it be pour'd hot into the Sore, and the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> afterwards ſtrew'd with the Powder of <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> prepar'd as follows. Beat a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> to Powder, and put it upon a Fire-ſhovel heated till it be pretty red, ſtirring it perpetually till it leave off Smoaking, and change its Colour; and when 'tis cold, mix it with half the quantity of <hi>Aloes</hi> in Powder. After you have ſtrew'd the Sore with this Powder of <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> lay over it a Bolſter of Flax dipt in the heated <hi>Balſam,</hi> and the <hi>Felander</hi> will quickly fall away; after which dreſs the Sore with the <hi>Counteſſes Ointment</hi> till it be heal'd.</p>
                     <p>All Country Gentlemen, who have Horſes, ought to be ſtill furniſh'd with this <hi>Balſam,</hi> by reaſon of its excellent Virtues againſt ſeveral Diſtempers. And thoſe who carry many Horſes to the Army, ought ſtill to make Proviſion of this Remedy, to prevent the dangerous conſequences of the Accidents that happen ſo frequently in a Camp.</p>

                     <p>THis is a Tumour generated of <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Flegmatic</hi> Matter that grows hard by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its toughneſs, and ſeldom cauſes any conſiderable Pain.</p>
                     <p>It grows on the top or elbow of the Hough, and appears ſeparated from the Bone. 'Tis occaſion'd by hard Riding, and never grows very big.</p>
                     <p>It comes after Fatigues, or by rubbing the place againſt ſome hard Body, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a defluxion of the Humours.</p>
                     <p>'Tis eaſily curable at its firſt appearance, but when 'tis inveterate it grows painful, and can be hardly cur'd without <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> and even that violent Remedy is not able to diſſolve it entirely, or to prevent its growing again after immoderate Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure, you muſt foment the Swelling with a mixture of two parts of <hi>Brandy,</hi> and one part of <hi>Oil of Walnuts,</hi> rubbing it in diligently with your Hand.</p>
                     <p>Then ſhave off the Hair, and apply the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLXXIV. or that which follows.</p>

Then boil away one half of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and ſtrain what remains thro' a Linnen-Cloth while 'tis hot: Set it again upon the Fire till it begin to thicken, then adding <hi>black Pitch</hi> and <hi>Roſin,</hi> of each four Ounces, <hi>Turpentine,</hi> two Ounces, mix and make a Plaiſter to be apply'd to the Part, and renew'd once in nine Days, till the Swelling be conſum'd.</p>
                        <p>You may alſo diſſolve the Tumours by a long continu'd Application of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Ointment,</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> XLVIII. and the ſame effect is produc'd by the <hi>Oil of Walnuts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Tumour be not conſum'd by theſe Remedies, take <hi>Sal-Armoniac, Salt-Petre,</hi> and <hi>Gum-Ammoniacum,</hi> of each an Ounce; melt 'em by the Fire in a Pint of a very ſtrong <hi>Vinegar;</hi> then add four Ounces of <hi>Honey,</hi> and remove the Veſſel from the Fire. Anoint and chafe the Part twice a Day with this Compoſition; but if the Tumour be inveterate, hard and big it will not yield to the Remedy. Theſe Swellings are more offenſive to the Eye, than hurtful to the Horſe; tho' when they are old and hard, his Body is uſually waſted, by reaſon of the Pain, and at laſt he begins to Halt. And I have even ſeen ſome Horſes irrecoverably Lam'd, but this happens only in <hi>Manages,</hi> where the Horſes are kept to harder Exerciſe and Diet than they are able to bear.</p>
                        <p>If all theſe Remedies prove ineffectual you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Fire,</hi> making the Figure of a <hi>Star</hi> with a red-hot Knife, the Lines or Raſes being very near one another, and ſurrounding the Tumour. Then with a Pencil, dipt in <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> touch the burnt Parts, and as ſoon as they are dry apply hot <hi>Pitch</hi> with Saddle-ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings, or ſhavings of Cloth over all. You muſt wait till the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> ſink into the burnt Part, for the <hi>Pitch</hi> will not ſtick if it be apply'd before the Part be dry. After the Scabs are fall'n off, chaſe the Sore every Day till it be heal'd with <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and the Tumour will vaniſh by degrees; but if after the Cure you make the Horſe lean too much on his hinder Parts, he will grow irrecoverably Lame.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXXII. <hi>Of</hi> Wind-Galls.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Wind-Gall</hi> is a ſoft Swelling, caus'd by a cold, flegmatic, and ſerous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: If you preſs it with your Hand it yields and moves towards the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Swellings are uſually occaſion'd by violent and immoderate Exerciſe when a Horſe is young, the ſmallneſs, weakneſs, and fleſhineſs of the Hough, and by being kept too long on a ſloping Floor, which raiſes the fore-part of a Horſe much higher than the reſt of his Body.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they grow on both ſides of the Hough, but in the beginning they appear only on the out-ſide. The Cure is difficult in either place.</p>
                     <p>The Tumour is ſoft, and without Pain, of the bigneſs of a little Apple more or leſs, ſeated between the great Sinew of the Hough and the end of the Thigh-Bone. This Diſeaſe is often Hereditary, and deriv'd from the Stallion.</p>
                     <p>When the Tumour is hard and inveterate, there is little hope of diſſolving it by any other Method than by <hi>giving the Fire;</hi> but the Cure may be perform'd by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Remedies before the Swelling grow hard and big.</p>
                     <p>Shave away the Hair, and apply ſuch Remedies as are endu'd with a Virtue to <hi>ſoften,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>diſſolve</hi> the Tumour.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>ſoftening</hi> of the Swelling, take the Roots of <hi>Briony</hi> and <hi>wild Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber;</hi> or for want of the latter, common <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> of each two Ounces; beat 'em groſsly, and boil 'em in an equal mixture of <hi>Oil-Olive</hi> and <hi>Hog's-Greaſe</hi> till they begin to ſoften: Then beat 'em to a Maſh, and preſs 'em thro' a Hair-Sieve: Mix the Straining with the <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Greaſe,</hi> adding <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Roſin,</hi> of each four Ounces; <hi>Reſumptive Ointment,</hi> half a Pound; and after the whole is melted, thicken it with a ſufficient quantity of the Flower or Powder of <hi>Linſeed</hi> or <hi>Fenugreek-ſeed;</hi> mix and make a <hi>Pultiſs</hi> to be apply'd with Flax, ſowing a Piece of Cloth about the Part. Renew the Application once in forty eight Hours: This will <hi>ſoften</hi> the Tumour, and you muſt afterwards endeavour to <hi>reſolve</hi> it. You may with leſs trouble, but at leaſt equal Charge, <hi>ſoften</hi> theſe Tumours with a Plaiſter made of equal quantities of <hi>Oxy-croceum,</hi> and <hi>Melilote Plaiſter.</hi>

                           <hi>To</hi> Reſolve <hi>a</hi> Tumour.</head>
                        <p>Quench four or five pieces of <hi>unſlak'd Lime,</hi> in three Quarts of ſtrong <hi>Vinegar;</hi> and after it has ſtood two Hours to ſettle, ſtrain out the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and put into it two Handfuls of the hot Aſhes of <hi>Vine-Branches;</hi> let it ſtand till it ſettle, and pour off the clear Liquor into another Pot. To a Quart of this <hi>Vinegar</hi> add dry <hi>Pigeon's-Dung,</hi> and <hi>Oil of Peter,</hi> of each four Ounces; burnt <hi>Allom</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> of each two Ounces; <hi>Oil of Caſtor,</hi> four Ounces; boil all together for the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour, and anoint the Tumour once every Day, which will probably be diſſolv'd in ſeven or eight Days. If the Horſes Skin be thin and tender, this Remedy will break it, and draw forth a reddiſh Water, without raiſing a Scab; but if the Skin be hard and dry, it produces a ſort of Scurf, which muſt be anointed, that it may fall off. The <hi>Plaiſter of Walnuts</hi> is a powerful Reſolver, but can hardly be made to ſtick to the Part.</p>
                        <p>After the Tumour is diſſolv'd, <hi>take up</hi> the Veins above and under the Hough, which may alſo be done in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>I might eaſily name a great number of <hi>Simples</hi> that are endu'd with a ſoftening, rarefying, and diſcuſſing quality. If the two above-mention'd Remedies do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your expectation, you may try that which follows; and if that prove unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you muſt proceed to <hi>give the Fire.</hi>

Then pour the Ointment into another Pot, and fifteen or twenty Days after ſtir it about, that the <hi>Oil</hi> which ſwims on the Top may be incorporated with the <hi>Ointment:</hi> After which cover the Pot, and in a Month (and not ſooner) the <hi>Ointment</hi> will be fit for Uſe.</p>
                     <p>This is a kind of <hi>Cauſtic,</hi> endu'd with an admirable Efficacy to diſſolve and conſume <hi>Wind-Galls, Splints, Water-Farcin,</hi> and the <hi>Knots</hi> of the <hi>Farcin;</hi> and is oftentimes found alone to be ſufficient for the Cure of the laſt of theſe Diſtempers.

                     <p>You muſt apply it cold, anointing the Parts ſlightly once a day, that it may not occaſion a Swelling. For the Cure of a <hi>Splent,</hi> make a Plaiſter of this Oinment ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cover the Tumours, bind it on, and let it ſtick forty eight Hours; then anoint the Scabs with <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> till it fall away.</p>
                     <p>You muſt apply it with a Pencil, that you may be the better able to judge of the Quantity.</p>
                     <p>It may be kept very long without loſing its Strength; and even encreaſes in Virtue the longer 'tis kept.</p>
                     <p>You may apply the following Remedy to aſſwage one of theſe Tumours; but it will grow again if the Horſe be over-ridden.</p>
                     <p>Take a Quart of ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> three Ounces of <hi>Galbanum,</hi> and a like Quantity of <hi>Maſtic;</hi> boil away two thirds of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> till the <hi>Gumms</hi> be diſſolv'd. Then add <hi>Oriental Bole</hi> and common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> of each one Pound, incorporating 'em over a gentle Fire to the Conſiſtence of a <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> which muſt be apply'd not to the Swelling, and cover'd with a piece of Paper.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>giving of the Fire</hi> ſucceeds beſt, and operates moſt effectually, after the Application of <hi>ſoftening</hi> Remedies. It muſt be given in the <hi>Wane of the Moon,</hi> and at the ſame time you muſt <hi>barr</hi> or ſear the Vein both above and under the Hough. But this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:179659:369"/>is not always attended with Succeſs, when the Tumour is grown very big; for only one part of it is diſſolv'd by the Fire: And therefore the ſureſt way is to give the Fire on both ſides of the Hough, aſſoon as you perceive the Swelling; for if it be only given on that ſide where the Tumour is ſeated, it will drive the Swelling to the other ſide.

                     <p>THis is a callous Tumour, caus'd by tough and flegmatic Matter, which by reaſon of its hardneſs, preſſes the Sinews and Tendons that are the Inſtruments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and is attended with ſuch a violent Pain, that the Horſe pines away, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grows lame. This is a very dangerous Diſtemper, for it may make a Horſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably lame, and unfit for Service. 'Tis almoſt always Hereditary, tho' it may be ſometimes occaſion'd by Fatigues, and eſpecially by making a Horſe, whoſe Houghs are naturally weak and ſmall, gallop and perform other Exerciſes, ſuch as Riding up or down a Hill, leaping and curvetting, in which the whole Weight of the Body lies upon the Houghs. But nothing hurts the Hough more dangerouſly than a ſhort and ſudden ſtop after hard Galloping: For one ſuch ill-tim'd ſtop may cauſe either a <hi>Jardon</hi> or a <hi>Spavin,</hi> and for ever deprive the Horſe of the right Uſe of his Limbs.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſtemper, ſhave away the Hair, and lay a Plaiſter upon the Place, which will diſſipate the Swelling for ſome time, if the Horſe be not lame; in which Caſe, or if he be ridden very hard, the Tumour will grow again; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſureſt way is to <hi>give the Fire</hi> after the Application of the Plaiſter.

                     <p>THis is a ſort of <hi>Convulſive</hi> or deprav'd Motion, without any viſible Swelling in the Hough, which proceeds from a certain thick and tough Matter that falls from the upper Parts upon the Muſcles, and obſtructs the Motion of the Hough, ſo that the Horſe is forc'd to perform the whole Motion with his Hip, ſnatching up his Leg on a ſudden, and lifting it up higher than the other. Moſt Horſes that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd with this Diſtemper, aſſoon as the Hough is heal'd, that is, after they have walk'd five or ſix ſteps, ſeem perfectly ſound; but if you make 'em ſtand till the Hough cool, the firſt ſteps they make will be attended with the ſame unſeemly ſnatching up of the Leg, as before. This Infirmity appears viſibly to the Eye: Sometimes it ſeizes on both Houghs; 'tis not always painful, nor ſo dangerous as the <hi>Bone-Spavin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Perſons ſcruple not to buy a Horſe that is troubl'd with this Infirmity, but they ought at leaſt to beat down the Price as low as they can; for 'tis certainly a great Defect in a Horſe, and 'tis not only impoſſible for him to go ſwiftly, but he's in great danger of being irrecoverably lam'd by it.</p>
                     <p>I never ſaw the Cure of this Diſtemper attempted by any other Method, than by <hi>giving the Fire;</hi> and therefore I will not pretend to give any Directions to thoſe who are unwilling to venture on that Operation.</p>
                     <p>When a Horſe that is troubl'd with the <hi>String-halt,</hi> begins to grow lame, as it happens not unfrequently, you muſt immediately <hi>give the Fire,</hi> as in the Cure of a <hi>Bone-Spavin,</hi> and perhaps your Horſe will recover in two or three Months: and even tho' the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be not attended with Lameneſs, 'tis highly convenient to <hi>give the Fire;</hi> for it diſſolves and conſumes a part of that thick and tough Matter, which obſtructing the Muſcles of the Hough, cauſes this unſeemly Motion, and uſually makes the Horſe halt at laſt.</p>

                     <p>THis Diſtemper takes its Name from <hi>Oxen,</hi> who are almoſt always troubl'd with it when they grow old. 'Tis a Tumour generated by cold Humours, which by degrees grows as hard as a Bone, the moſt ſubtil parts of the Humours being diſſolv'd and evaporated. 'Tis occaſion'd by the ſame Accidents that are aſſign'd for the Cauſes of the <hi>Jardon,</hi> and is ſeated below on the inſide of the Hough, where 'tis join'd to the Leg in the part mark'd 30 in the Figure. 'Tis ſmall at firſt, but afterwards grows big.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is ſometimes, but not always, attended with Lameneſs.</p>
                     <p>It cauſes ſo violent a Pain that the Horſe pines away, eſpecially about the Flanks, and cannot bear Labour. This is a very dangerous Diſeaſe, and for my part I wou'd not buy a Horſe that was troubl'd with it at any Rate.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen ſome Horſes with great <hi>Bone-Spavins</hi> on their Legs, who nevertheleſs did not halt, nor were waſted, and even trotted equally with both their hinder Legs on a pav'd Cauſey. Theſe Horſes may do Service in plain Grounds, but in a Mountainous Country 'tis not ſafe to truſt to 'em.</p>
                     <p>The moſt skilful <hi>Horſe-Courſers</hi> buy Horſes that are troubl'd with ſuch a kind of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> provided they do not halt, but go well and even. But 'tis to be conſider'd that they do not buy 'em for their own Uſe, and all the Service they require of 'em is to bring more Money than they coſt; for they uſually ſell 'em for ſound Horſes: But they who will be rul'd by my Advice, ſhall never meddle with 'em, eſpecially in Mountainous Countries, where the Houghs are much exercis'd.</p>
                     <p>This is a very dangerous Diſtemper, and requires the moſt violent Remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fire;</hi> and even that is oftentimes apply'd without Succeſs.</p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:179659:370"/>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is <hi>hereditary,</hi> 'tis in vain to attempt the Cure by any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, than by <hi>giving the Fire:</hi> otherwiſe you may in the beginning try ſome external Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Ointments of Agrippa, Marſh-Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Martiatum,</hi> of each two Ounces; <hi>Oil of Flower-de-luce</hi> one Ounce; <hi>Oil of Earth-Worms,</hi> and of <hi>Dwarf-Elder</hi> Seeds, of each three Ounces; Mix 'em all together, and apply 'em warm by way of Plaiſter to the <hi>Spavin.</hi> Continue after the ſame Manner eight or ten Days, after which if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Amendment, ſhave away the Hair, and lay on one of the Plaiſters preſcrib'd in the preceding Chapters, keeping it on for the ſpace of five or ſix Days, and then <hi>give the Fire</hi> very dexterouſly, but not too gently. At the ſame time fear the Vein above and under the Thigh, and draw a Line along it, from the part where 'tis ſear'd, or barr'd above to that where 'tis barr'd below, half a Foot under the Hough; for if this great Vein be not ſtopp'd, it will perpetually feed the Tumour.</p>
                     <p>It will not be improper to admoniſh the Reader, to prevent his being cheated or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, that no Perſon can promiſe a certain Cure in this Caſe, or to make a Horſe ſound that is troubl'd with the <hi>Spavin,</hi> by <hi>giving the Fire;</hi> tho' there is no other effectual Remedy. 'Tis true, it cures many Horſes, but there are others who remain lame all their Life, eſpecially thoſe who have been long troubl'd with the <hi>Spavin;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Maſters continue to make uſe of 'em, but the Service of a lame Horſe can never be either pleaſant, or very uſeful.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Blood-Spavin</hi> is by ſeveral Farriers miſtaken for a <hi>Curb;</hi> but it grows ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wide of the Place where that Tumour is uſefully ſeated, and a little lower. 'Tis originally occaſion'd by the exceſſive Bigneſs of the <hi>Maſter-Vein</hi> of the Thigh; for if the Hough happen to be ſtrain'd when the Horſe is young, the Blood flows too plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, and with too great impetuoſity into that Part, and dilates the Vein under the Hough where the <hi>Blood-Spavin</hi> grows. 'Tis a ſoft Swelling, and yields to your Finger when you touch it: It may be compar'd to a <hi>Varix</hi> in Men, ſince it is only a Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Maſter-Vein,</hi> which paſſes under it, and feeds it. 'Tis ſeated under the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt apparent Bone on the inſide of the Hough, and is not accompany'd with Pain. The only Remedy for this Diſtemper, is to pluck out a Piece of the Vein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLXXXV. Coach-Horſes that are full of Fleſh are moſt uſually troubl'd with the <hi>Blood-Spavin:</hi> It does not make the Horſe halt, nor is it very prejudicial to him; but thoſe who are more timorous than skilful, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fanſie it to be a <hi>Curb,</hi> which is a hard Swelling, and grows in a different Place. The <hi>Blood-Spavin</hi> may be diſſolv'd by the following Method, but you muſt expect that it will grow again aſſoon as you begin to ride your Horſe: Rub the Swelling from time to time with <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Bay,</hi> and there will ariſe a Scurf which may be taken away by Bathing the Part with the Scowrings of Diſhes; then anoint it again with the <hi>Oil,</hi> and continue after the ſame manner, taking up the Vein above and under the Hough.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the uſual Cuſtom of Farriers to attempt the Cure of a <hi>Blood-Spavin</hi> by <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> but this Method does not anſwer Expectation; for it does not take away the Tumour, tho' it often times hinders it from growing.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear taking this Occaſion to admoniſh the Reader, from my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to beware of the dangerous Conſequences occaſion'd by the Application of the <hi>Ointment of Beetles,</hi> or <hi>Ruptory-Plaiſters,</hi> to theſe Tumours. This is an important Caution, and ought never to be forgotten.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXXVIII <hi>Of the</hi> Curb.</head>
                     <p>THE Curb is a large and hard Tumour, generated of Flegmatic Matter, ſeated on the inſide of the Hough, higher than the <hi>Spavin,</hi> on the ſubſtance of the Tendon that ſtrengthens the Part: 'Tis a long Swelling, reſembling a Pear, cleft thro' the middle, into two Pieces, higher above than below, and ſometimes makes the Horſe halt.</p>
                     <p>It appears moſt commonly in the Legs of thoſe Horſes that are employ'd in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Carts, Coaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Hough is apt to be ſtrain'd by that kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the great Sinew being afterwards weaken'd, all the Humours flow thither, and are fed by the <hi>Maſter-Vein</hi> of the Thigh, that runs very near this place. It may be alſo occaſion'd by backing a Horſe too ſoon, and ſometimes proceeds from the weakneſs and ſmallneſs of the Hough, and from the other cauſes I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in healing of the other Diſeaſes of the Hough.</p>
                     <p>The Cure may be attempted by the ſame Remedies that are preſcrib'd for the <hi>Spavin,</hi> but with little Succeſs; for our only hope in this caſe muſt be in <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> which nevertheleſs does frequently diſappoint us; for it only prevents the encreaſe of the <hi>Curb,</hi> but does not effectually diſſolve it.</p>
                     <p>Since the <hi>giving of the Fire</hi> is ſo general and ſo uſeful a Remedy for Horſes, I ſhall take this occaſion to explain the way of performing the Operation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXXIX. <hi>Of the manner of</hi> giving the Fire <hi>to Horſes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>'TIS a general Rule that admits of no Exceptions, unleſs in caſes of extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that the <hi>Fire</hi> muſt be always given during the <hi>Wane of the Moon.</hi> The beſt time is about five or ſix Days after the <hi>Full-Moon.</hi> I have oftentimes had occaſion, in this Book, to treat of the Parts where the <hi>Fire</hi> muſt be given; and of the Diſeaſes which it cures. Nevertheleſs, I think my ſelf oblig'd to add ſome Conſiderations to what has been ſaid on that ſubject, for a further clearing of a Doubt which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently propos'd, namely, whether this Operation can be perform'd ſafely on <hi>Nervous</hi> or <hi>Sinewy</hi> Parts. In anſwer to this Queſtion I maintain, that the <hi>Fire</hi> may be given without any danger, provided the Skin be not pierc'd with the red-hot Knives, or other Inſtruments that are made uſe of: And therefore, that you may proceed with greater Security, you muſt obſerve theſe three Directions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Preſs not too hard upon the Part.</item>
                        <item>2. Let the Knife be red-hot, not flaming.</item>
                        <item>3. Let it be heated in a Charcoal Fire.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>With a due obſervance of theſe Cautions, the Operation may be perform'd in any part of the Body, without the leaſt prejudice to the Sinews, or any other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency whatſoever. This aſſertion is grounded upon undoubted Experience, which is the moſt demonſtrative Argument in ſuch caſes: For can you imagine a Part fuller of Nerves and Ligaments than the <hi>Hough,</hi> and the hinder part of the <hi>Shank-Bone</hi> of the Fore-Legs; and yet I can aſſure you, that the <hi>Fire</hi> has been given a hundred times on all theſe places by my order, on the inſide, on the outſide, on the bending, both the ſides and hinder Part of the Leg, and even on the <hi>Paſtern-Joints,</hi> both of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Legs,</hi> where there is a great number of <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and the Skin is very near the Bones that move the Joint; ſo that the leaſt alteration or hurt wou'd have been eaſily perceiv'd. In all theſe caſes I obſerv'd, that the Horſe was at leaſt <hi>eas'd,</hi> if not perfectly <hi>cur'd;</hi> for the <hi>Fire</hi> is the moſt powerful Reſolvent that can be apply'd,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:179659:371"/>and aſſwages thoſe hard and congeal'd Swellings that reſiſt the Operation of all other Remedies; ſo that the Leg which was ſwoll'n and deform'd before, becomes clean and fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> who deſerve to be commended for their extraordinary Skill in Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and for their Care not to venture on any dangerous Operation, without a due Examination and Knowledge of the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, are frequently wont to <hi>give the Fire</hi> on the legs and Houghs of their Horſes by way of Preſervation, and never eſteem a Horſe the leſs valuable becauſe he has ſuffer'd this Operation. And the ſame Cuſtom prevails among the <hi>Turks, Arabs,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> who uſually <hi>give the Fire,</hi> to prevent the ill Conſequences of thoſe fatiguing Marches to which their Horſes are daily expos'd.</p>
                     <p>'Twou'd be an endleſs Labour to undertake the Confutation of all the Errours that are introduc'd by Ignorance and want of Experience in thoſe who are entruſted with the Cure of Horſes: But I may ſay without Vanity, that I have made ſeveral ſucceſsful Attempts in order to the rooting out of thoſe Abuſes, and particularly that I have brought this Method into Reputation and Credit; eſpecially at <hi>Paris:</hi> and I can aſſure the Reader, that in a vaſt Number of Tryals, I have always found the Effect to anſwer, and even ſometimes to exceed my Expectation. 'Tis true, that if the Horſe be ſuffer'd to rub off the Skin, or to lick the Sores, the Marks uſually remain for a long time after: But theſe unſeemly Scars ought not to be aſcrib'd to the Fire, but to the Neglect of thoſe who undertake the Cure. 'Tis highly convenient, or rather neceſſary in this Caſe to hinder the Horſe from rubbing, biting, licking, or peeling the burnt Parts, after the falling of the Scab, when the Fleſh is raw: For if this Caution be not obſerv'd, all the Dexterity of the Operator cannot prevent the enſuing Deformity of the Part. But ſince 'tis extremely difficult to reſtrain Horſes from endeavouring ſome way or other to eaſe themſelves of the Itch that torments 'em when the Sores begin to heal, you muſt put Collars upon 'em as upon Horſes that are troubl'd with the <hi>Farcin,</hi> or tye 'em up ſo faſt, that they may not be able to lick their Sores. And at the ſame time ſtrew the Part with Powder of burnt <hi>Allom,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> calcin'd to Redneſs, uſually call'd <hi>Colcothar,</hi> or waſh 'em with the <hi>Vulnerary Water</hi> once a day, which wonderfully allays that troubleſome Itching. For want of the <hi>Vulnerary Water,</hi> you may apply either the <hi>Second,</hi> or the <hi>Yellow Water;</hi> and frequent walking is alſo very uſeful in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Directions be obſerv'd, there will be ſcarce any apparent Marks of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially in Winter when the Hair is long; and even ſome Horſes, who ſuffer'd this Operation under my Inſpection, have been afterwards ſold without any ſuſpicion on the Buyer's ſide, that the Fire had ever been apply'd to any part of 'em. In <hi>giving the Fire,</hi> unleſs in Caſes of extreme Neceſſity, you muſt never pierce the Skin, at leaſt in ſuch Parts as are of neceſſary Uſe, but only ſear it gently, and by degrees, till it be of a reddiſh Colour, reſembling a Cherry.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Cure of thoſe Holes that are made by piercing the Skin, is extremely difficult. Sometimes certain Bunches or Tumours, grow upon the Cheeks, which if they were ſeated in any other part of the Body, ought to be pierc'd with a red-hot Iron aſſoon as they are fully ripen'd, and the Matter fit to be evacuated: But the <hi>giving of the Fire</hi> is extremely dangerous on the flat part of the Cheek, for it uſually produces an Ulcer that cannot be heal'd without great difficulty.</p>
                     <p>The Skin is uſually pierc'd for <hi>Ring-Bones, Scratches, Quitter-Bones, Over-Reaches</hi> on the <hi>Cronet</hi> or <hi>Hoof, Strains</hi> in the <hi>Hips</hi> or <hi>Shoulders:</hi> And ſometimes there are only ſmall Holes made which ſcarce pierce the Skin, and a Plaiſter laid over 'em. Theſe are almoſt the only Caſes in which the Skin may be ſafely pierc'd; for 'tis very dangerous to make ſuch an Attempt in the Houghs, and other Nervous Parts. The right Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Operation requires time; for 'tis incomparably better to make uſe of a moderately hot Knife, and to draw the ſame Stroak five or ſix times over, then to make it at one daſh with a very hot Knife. Many Farriers are guilty of an Errour on the other ſide; for they only burn the Hair, which they call <hi>giving of the Fire lightly,</hi> tho' it hardly deſerves the Name of <hi>Fire</hi> at all, ſince it produces no Effect. 'Tis true, indeed, thoſe who commend the way of <hi>giving the Fire lightly,</hi> may be ſaid to ſpeak more reaſonably than they think; but tho' we muſt not imitate 'em, in burning only the Hair, and ſcarce touching the Skin; 'tis certain the Operation muſt be perform'd with a light and ſteddy Hand, but, as I intimated before, the Skin muſt be ſear'd till it acquire a bright Cherry-Colour.</p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:179659:371"/>
                     <p>Seven or eight Days before the Application of the Fire, the Parts muſt be ſoften'd either with <hi>Baths</hi> or <hi>Fomentations,</hi> ſuch as are mention'd in the Chapters that treat of <hi>tyr'd</hi> and <hi>decay'd Legs,</hi> or with ſoftening Remedies, ſuch as are preſcrib'd for the Cure of <hi>Splents:</hi> For thus the Humours are diſpos'd to yield to the Operation of the <hi>Fire,</hi> which finds leſs Reſiſtance, and more effectually diſſipates and diſſolves 'em.</p>
                     <p>The Part being ſoften'd, you muſt proceed to <hi>give the Fire</hi> gently and dexterouſly, according to the Nature and Situation of the Part, either in the Form of a <hi>Feather, Roſe, Shield, Palm of the Hand,</hi> or any other convenient Figure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fire</hi> thus dextrouſly and lightly given to a Part that is already <hi>ſoften'd,</hi> will produce a much more conſiderable Effect, than the moſt violent <hi>Fire</hi> that can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, without a due Preparation of the Part by <hi>ſoftening</hi> Remedies.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>giving of the Fire</hi> you may apply <hi>yellow Wax</hi> melted, and mixt with <hi>black Pitch</hi> alſo melted, with Shavings of Cloth over all; and after nine, ten, or twelve Days, when the Scabs fall away, waſh the burnt Part once a day with <hi>Brandy.</hi> I ſeldom uſe <hi>Plaiſters</hi> in theſe Caſes, ſince the Cure may be effectually perform'd by anointing the burnt Parts once a day with a Mixture of <hi>Brandy</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> and by waſhing the Sores with <hi>Brandy</hi> alone after the Scabs are fall'n. 'Tis true when the Skin is pierc'd, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to apply a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> to concentrate the Heat of the <hi>Fire,</hi> that it may operate with greater Vigour: But when the Skin is only ſear'd, as in the Cure of a <hi>Farcin,</hi> the Fire does not ſtand in need of that Aſſiſtance. The Scab falls away of it ſelf, and leaves a leſs viſible Mark, than when <hi>Wax, Pitch,</hi> or any <hi>Plaiſter</hi> is apply'd, which commonly brings away ſuch large Pieces of the Skin, that the Place remains ever afterwards mark'd and deform'd.</p>
                     <p>You muſt <hi>give the Fire</hi> with a Knife that has a pretty thin Edge, but rather round than ſharp, and always rub it on a piece of Wood when you take it out of the Fire; for the Aſhes that ſtick to it wou'd cut and feſter the Skin. You muſt alſo obſerve to follow the Hair, that it may cover the Marks after the Sores are heal'd. Thus, for Example, when you have occaſion to <hi>give the Fire</hi> on the <hi>Sinews</hi> of the <hi>Fore-Legs,</hi> you muſt draw a Line or Raſe downwards between the <hi>Sinew</hi> and the <hi>Bone</hi> on both ſides, and three or four more upon the <hi>Sinews</hi> at equal Diſtances, rather than imitate thoſe who draw croſs Lines, as if they were going to broil a Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a needleſs Piece of Curioſity to apply <hi>drying</hi> and <hi>Reſtringent Ointments</hi> to the burnt Parts, unleſs when the Skin is pierc'd, and there is Reaſon to fear a large and unſeemly Scar. Theſe <hi>Ointments</hi> are thus compos'd; Take <hi>Tarr</hi> and <hi>Burgundy Pitch,</hi> of each half a Pound; <hi>Bole-Armenic</hi> and <hi>Seal'd-Earth,</hi> of each ſix Ounces; <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Roſin,</hi> of each four Ounces; Powder of <hi>Roſes</hi> an Ounce: Mix and make an <hi>Ointment.</hi> But <hi>Farriers</hi> uſe only <hi>black Pitch,</hi> becauſe 'tis cheaper, and more eaſily procur'd.</p>
                     <p>I will not pretend to reſtrain any Man from obſerving this Method; but I believe it may be better omitted, for when a Scab falls away of it ſelf, it leaves the Skin that is next to it entire, and the Scar is leſs apparent. I acknowledge 'tis neceſſary to apply a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> in ſome Places, to concentrate the Heat of the Fire, that it may diſſolve the Swelling more effectually, eſpecially in ſuch Parts of the Body, where a Scar does not occaſion any conſiderable Deformity. 'Tis alſo to be obſerv'd, that thoſe who deſign to apply a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> muſt draw the Stroaks at a greater diſtance than 'twou'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be neceſſary to do. Almoſt every <hi>Farrier</hi> has a peculiar Method of <hi>giving the Fire;</hi> ſome perform the Operation with a Piece of <hi>four Piſtoles,</hi> ſome with a <hi>Silver Knife,</hi> and others with one of <hi>Copper,</hi> which I believe is the moſt convenient Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for <hi>Copper</hi> reſiſts Corruption, and cleanſes Wounds. <hi>Gold</hi> is certainly endu'd with many excellent Virtues, but I have often obſerv'd, that, contrary to the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it makes a very large Scab, and leaves and ugly Scar. There is ſomething very ſoft in <hi>Silver,</hi> and its Fire is not ſo ſharp and fierce as that of <hi>Gold:</hi> But to avoid a needleſs Charge, I have hitherto us'd <hi>Copper</hi> Knives with very good Succeſs, and I ſhall always prefer 'em before <hi>Gold,</hi> tho' not before <hi>Silver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear repeating the important Advice I have already given you, never to make your Knife too hot, and to heat it always in a <hi>Charcoal-Fire;</hi> for there is a certain Sharpneſs in <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Pit-Coals,</hi> which makes a very large Scab.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd that the <hi>Fire</hi> does not generally produce a very quick Effect; and I have ſometimes obſerv'd that it exerts not its utmoſt Vigour till ſix Months after it is given: For 'tis an inſenſible and ſlow-pac'd <hi>Reſolvent,</hi> and requires a very conſiderable ſpace of time, before it can digeſt and concoct the Humour; and therefore every Man that reſolves to have Recourſe to this Method, muſt arm himſelf with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:179659:372"/>Patience; but the <hi>Sureneſs</hi> of the Effect will make amends for the <hi>Slowneſs</hi> of it. For oftentimes a Horſe continues to halt three or four Months after the <hi>giving of the Fire,</hi> but at laſt perfectly recovers his former Soundneſs and Vigour. Nevertheleſs you muſt not imagine that the <hi>Fire</hi> is a never-failing Remedy, for there are ſome inveterate Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that can neither be cur'd by this, nor any other Method.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, in the next place, proceed to give you ſome Directions, concerning the <hi>Reſt</hi> that is neceſſary for a Horſe after he has receiv'd the <hi>Fire</hi> in his Legs, Houghs, and other low and hanging Parts of his Body. The Effect of the Fire laſts twenty ſeven Days, which may be divided into three equal Periods, for its Augmentation, State, and Declination. Now 'twou'd be convenient to let the Horſe repoſe all that while: But the ſhorteſt time of Reſt that can be allow'd on this Occaſion, is at leaſt eighteen Days. I know that many Perſons begin to work their Horſes ſooner; but in my Opinion it is better to neglect the Cure wholly than to perform it imperfectly. In the mean time the Horſe muſt not be ſuffer'd to lie perpetually loitering in the Stable; for the Fire will operate more vigorouſly, and the Swelling will be ſooner abated, if you walk him gently half an Hour every Day: But even this Exerciſe muſt not be begun till eighteen Days after <hi>giving the Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Farriers</hi> are wonderfully afraid of <hi>giving the Fire</hi> on the <hi>ſinewy</hi> Parts of the Body; but their Fear is certainly an Effect their Ignorance. I dare boldly affirm, that this Operation may be ſafely perform'd without piercing the Skin, and with a due Dexterity and Nimbleneſs, in any Part without Exception: Nor wou'd I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Aſſertion with ſo much Confidence, if I were not convinc'd of the Truth of it by a hundred different Experiments. But the three Cautions mention'd in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> are of ſo great a Importance in this Caſe, that to make a ſtronger Impreſſion upon the Reader's Mind, 'twill not be improper to ſubjoin the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Example. I ſaw two Farriers perform this Operation on the two Fore-Legs of the ſame Horſe, and I obſerv'd alſo that the Number of the Stroaks or Raſes, was equal on both Legs. One of 'em did the Work dexterouſly, and with a light Hand, and the Succeſs was ſuitable to his Performance: But the other, who preſs'd too hard upon the Part, and over-heated his Knives, had the Mortification to ſee the whole Skin of the Leg fall away, and the remaining Sores were not cur'd without extreme Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>To make the Fire penetrate and reſolve a hard Swelling, ſuppoſing you had not time to prepare the Part with ſoftening Remedies; you muſt immediately after the <hi>giving of the Fire,</hi> touch the Stroaks two or three times with a Pencil dipt in Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which will concentrate the Heat of the Fire, and make it operate more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than it cou'd otherwiſe do. If you deſign afterwards to apply a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> to the burnt Part, you muſt wait till the Spirit be imbib'd or ſuck'd in; for thus the Scabs will fall away ſooner, and leave the Sore fair and clean.</p>
                     <p>I took occaſion to intimate before, that I might juſtly reckon my ſelf among the Number of thoſe who have brought this Method into Faſhion at <hi>Paris,</hi> and baniſh thoſe ill-grounded Fears and Apprehenſions that formerly deterr'd People from the Uſe of it. I think I may be allow'd to ſay, that in this Reſpect I have done a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service to the Public, for I have <hi>given the Fire</hi> to ſo many Horſes, that thoſe who are Witneſſes of the good Effect of it, were at laſt freed from their Prejudices, and ſubmitted to <hi>Experience,</hi> which is certainly the beſt and ſureſt Inſtructer. About twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Years ago the <hi>giving of the Fire</hi> was reckon'd to be as effectual a way to diſpatch a Horſe as the diſcharging of a <hi>Muſquet</hi> at his Head; but now the Caſe is alter'd, and this Method is commonly practis'd without the leaſt Scruple.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. CLXXX. <hi>Of all the</hi> Sores, Pains, Swellings, <hi>and</hi> Diſtempers <hi>of</hi> hinder Legs, <hi>from the</hi> Hough <hi>downwards.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>'TIS a common Inconvenience of the large Horſes of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> that by reaſon of their Flegmatic Conſtitution, and the Moiſtneſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they were brought up, their Legs are ſo full of Fleſh and Hair, that the Grooms and Coach-Men are not able to keep 'em clean: And the Dirt, which is full of a ſort of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>corroſive Salt,</hi> frets the Skin, and draws down the Humours which generate all the Ulcers and Sores that are commonly obſerv'd in the Legs of <hi>Coach-Horſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fat and fleſhy Houghs are more ſubject to theſe Sores, than thoſe that are dry and ſinewy: For they abound with Humours, which foment and nouriſh all the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that happen in theſe Parts, of which I deſign to treat in Order.</p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe noiſome Sores, call'd the <hi>Pains</hi> in the Legs of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſes, ſome Perſons obſerve the following Method.</p>
                     <p>They cleave the <hi>Spur,</hi> which is a ſoft horny Subſtance, that almoſt all Horſes have behind their <hi>Paſtern-Joint;</hi> and dividing the Skin beneath that Part, they ſeparate a Piece of ſpongy and glandulous Fleſh of the Bigneſs of a <hi>Walnut,</hi> which they ſay is the Receptacle of the flowing Humours that occaſion <hi>Running Sores, Pains, Warts,</hi> &amp;c. having taken out this Piece of Fleſh, they ſtop the Hole with Flax dipt in hot <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,</hi> which they keep in ſeven or eight Days, with <hi>Shooe-Maker's</hi> Thread faſten'd to the Lips of the Wound; afterwards they waſh it with warm Wine, and put in Flax dipt in hot <hi>Turpentine,</hi> as before. This Operation is only perform'd in the Legs, and I believe does neither good nor Harm.</p>
                     <p>Others, by way of Preſervation, aſſoon as they have bought a <hi>Coach-Horſe, take up</hi> the Veins of the Legs above and under the <hi>Hough,</hi> to intercept the Paſſage of the Humours that feed theſe Sores. This Method, in my Opinion, is much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than the former; but the beſt way to preſerve Horſes from theſe noiſome Sores that break out on the Legs, after they have been ſeveral times heal'd, is to make him drink a Decoction of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> or for want of that, of <hi>Box-wood,</hi> for the ſpace of ſeven or eight Days in the <hi>Spring,</hi> according to the Method deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXLVI. and afterwards to <hi>purge</hi> him; repeating the ſame Courſe the next Year. This Method not only prevents the breaking forth of thoſe Sores, but is the only effectual Way to cure 'em, when they actually over-run the Legs: For the <hi>Decoction</hi> with the ſubſequent <hi>Purgation,</hi> diverts, conſumes, and evacuates the Humour that falls upon the Legs.</p>

                        <p>This Diſtemper is ſeated on the <hi>Maſter-Sinew,</hi> or at the ſide of it, a good ſpace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Hough,</hi> that is, about the midſt of the Leg or lower, reaching to the <hi>Paſtern-Joint:</hi> And the Hair falling off diſcovers very callous and rough Tumours, which are call'd <hi>Ratt-Tails,</hi> from the Reſemblance of their Figure; as the other Name is taken from their Likeneſs to the <hi>Arreſts,</hi> or ſmall Bones of a <hi>Fiſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cut off theſe <hi>Callus's</hi> with a red-hot Knife, and apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> till the Scab fall away; then dry up the Sore with the <hi>Counteſs's Ointment,</hi> or with the <hi>Powder</hi> mention'd in the Chapter of <hi>Wounds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Arreſts</hi> be moiſt without any <hi>Callus</hi> or Swelling, apply the <hi>Neat-Herd's Ointment,</hi> or that of <hi>Oldenburg.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Diſtemper offends the Eye, and occaſions an unſeemly Deformity, by peeling off the Hair of the Leg, but without any conſiderable Prejudice to the Horſe.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Mules</hi> are ſeated in the Bending of the <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> of the <hi>hinder Legs,</hi> fretting the Part, and diſcharging a ſharp and malignant Humour. Theſe are painful Sores, and oftentimes make the Horſe halt, being feſter'd by the Motion of the Horſe's Leg, which continually opens and ſhuts the Bought of the Joint where they grow. There are a hundred Receipts to dry 'em up; but if the <hi>Paſtern-Joints</hi> be ſwoll'n, you muſt rub the ſore Place with an equal Mixture of thin <hi>Linſeed-Oil</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Glaſs, till they be throughly incorporated, continuing the Application for the ſpace of eight Days; during which time you may ride or work the Horſe.</p>
                        <p>If the Swelling continue, apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> which will dry up the Sores, and draw out the Humour that cauſes the Swelling. If the <hi>Mules</hi> be neither accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with a Swelling, nor with ſo much Pain as to make the Horſe halt, you may dry 'em up with the <hi>Neat-Herd's Ointment,</hi> or with the <hi>black Ointment,</hi> deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLXXXII. or with the <hi>Water,</hi> mention'd immediately before it: Or you may apply the <hi>Ointment of Oldenburg,</hi> which is the ſtrongeſt Dryer propos'd in this Book.</p>

                        <p>Theſe <hi>Wart-like</hi> Tumours over-ſpread the <hi>Paſterns</hi> and <hi>Fetlock-Joints</hi> almoſt to the <hi>Fruſh,</hi> on the <hi>hinder Legs,</hi> ſending forth Matter when they are green. Cut off all the <hi>Warts</hi> entirely, and apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge</hi> to the Sores, till they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly heal'd.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Warts</hi> have no apparent Roots or Filaments, but are fed with a nervous Juice, which cauſes the intolerable Stench that accompanies 'em. For this Juice being out of its natural Place, degenerates immediately into Putrefaction, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continual Supplies of Nouriſhment to the Warts, occaſions the Growth of new ones, after thoſe that appear'd firſt are taken off.</p>
                        <p>Theſe troubleſome Tumours may be extirpated with <hi>Lapis Infernalis,</hi> or the <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cauſtic.</hi> But you muſt renew the Application after the Scabs are fall'n off, till it eat to the very Bottom of the <hi>Wart,</hi> and the Place appear perfectly ſmooth.</p>
                        <p>The following Remedy cures <hi>Warts,</hi> but they grow again three, four, five, or ſix Months after, ſometimes ſooner, and ſometimes later, during which time the Horſe continues fit for Service: However 'tis better to begin the Cure as often as the <hi>Warts</hi> appear, than to ſuffer 'em to grow abſolutely incurable. Mix an Ounce of <hi>crude Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> with three Ounces of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> or (which is better) <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 'em ſtand till the <hi>Mercury</hi> be conſum'd: For if it remain undiſſolv'd 'tis a Sign of the Weakneſs of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and you muſt promote the Solution with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Degree of Heat. This is an excellent <hi>Cauſtic</hi> for <hi>Farcin-Knots,</hi> which it cures in few Days, raiſing a little Scab without any Inflammation: And as for <hi>Warts,</hi> you muſt firſt make 'em clean, and wipe 'em with a Penſil of Hog's-Briſtles, then touch 'em from time to time with this <hi>Water,</hi> for three or four Days; after which they will fall quite away, and the Place will appear fair and clean, which you may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dry up with the <hi>Black Ointment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or, with leſs trouble, having rubb'd the <hi>Warts</hi> very hard, you may ſtrew it with a <hi>Powder,</hi> conſiſting of an equal Mixture of <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> endeavouring by all Means to make a conſiderable Quantity of the <hi>Powder</hi> ſtick to the <hi>Warts.</hi> Then burn the <hi>Warts</hi> with a red-hot Iron, and apply <hi>Leeks</hi> beaten with <hi>Hog's Lard</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Eſcar; after which if the <hi>Wart</hi> be not extirpated, begin again as before, and repeat the whole Proceſs three times, if need require, till the <hi>Wart</hi> be wholly conſum'd; then heal and dry up the Sore with the <hi>Ointment of Oldenburg,</hi> or the <hi>Coach-Man's Ointment,</hi> which is a very effectual Remedy for ſmall <hi>Warts:</hi> But the large ones muſt be cut off with a red-hot Knife.</p>

                     <p>PUT three Ounces of Powder of <hi>Copperas</hi> into a Crucible, with one Ounce of <hi>Arſenic</hi> in Powder. Place the <hi>Crucible</hi> in a Charcoal-Fire, ſtirring the Subſtances from time to time, but carefully avoiding their Malignant Steams. Continue a pretty ſmart degree of Heat, till the whole Matter be ſomewhat Reddiſh, then take the <hi>Crucible</hi> out of the Fire, and after it is cool'd, break it, and beat the Matter to a very fine Powder. Incorporate four Ounces of this Powder with five Ounces of <hi>Album Rhaſis,</hi> and make an Ointment to be apply'd cold to the <hi>Warts,</hi> anointing 'em lightly every Day, and they will fall off like <hi>Kernels</hi> of <hi>Nuts,</hi> without cauſing any Swelling in the Legs. But you muſt obſerve diligently theſe two Cautions; that only the <hi>Warts</hi> be anointed, and that the Horſe muſt not be wrought or ridden during the Application of the <hi>Ointment.</hi> After the <hi>Warts</hi> are fall'n off, dreſs the Sores with the <hi>Counteſs's Ointment;</hi> and thus the Cure will be compleated. This is one of the beſt <hi>Secrets</hi> in the World for <hi>Warts,</hi> and is alſo a very excellent Remedy for the <hi>Knots</hi> of the <hi>Farcin.</hi> The <hi>Warts</hi> fall off in leſs than a Month, and it will require as much time to heal the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sores, which are uſually very deep when the <hi>Warts</hi> are large. I have ſometimes extirpated <hi>Warts</hi> utterly by this Method; tho' at other times I cou'd only take 'em away for a time, after which they grew again as before.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Effect may be produc'd by anointing the <hi>Warts</hi> lightly every Day with the <hi>Duke of Newburg's Ointment;</hi> for ſometimes they are wholly rooted out, and ſometimes they begin again to appear after ſome time: The Horſe may be ridden or kept to his uſual Work during the Cure, if it be perform'd in <hi>Summer,</hi> but in the <hi>Winter</hi> you muſt obſerve a contrary Method.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Clefts appear on the Bought of the <hi>Paſterns,</hi> and are occaſion'd by a ſharp and malignant Humour that frets the Skin, and is accompany'd with Pain, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noiſome Stench.</p>
                        <p>Shave away the Hair from the ſore places, and if there be no Swelling, apply the <hi>Neat-herd's</hi> or <hi>Coach-man's Ointment,</hi> or, if neither of theſe can be procur'd, the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> which will quickly heal the <hi>Chops.</hi> If the Fleſh be foul, and retard the Cure, you muſt touch it with <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> and two Hours after apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> renewing the Application of the <hi>Charge</hi> till the <hi>Cleft</hi> be heal'd.</p>
                        <p>Some will hardly be perſuaded to ſhave away the Hair, pretending that it pricks and feſters the Sores when it grows again; but this is an Abuſe, for 'tis abſolutely impoſſible to keep the Part clean, and extremely difficult to perform the Cure while the Sores remain cover'd with Hair. And therefore to prevent any Inconveniency that may be occaſion'd by the cutting of the Hair, you muſt ſhave it very cloſe; and in my Opinion when a Horſe is ſubject to theſe <hi>Clefts,</hi> the beſt way is to keep the <hi>Paſterns</hi> continually ſhav'd, and to cut the Hair of thoſe Places as often as the <hi>Manc;</hi> but you muſt not cut the <hi>Fetlock.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Oil of Hemp-ſeed,</hi> or, for want of that, of <hi>Linſeed,</hi> is an excellent Remedy in this Caſe; for it allays the Sharpneſs of the Humours, and very often heals and dries up the Chops.</p>

                        <p>There is a certain ſtinking or fretting Matter that iſſues out of the Pores, and deadens the Skin of the <hi>Paſtern, Fetlock-Joint,</hi> and ſometimes of the whole <hi>Leg.</hi> And 'tis even ſo Corroſive, that it looſens the <hi>Hoof</hi> from the <hi>Cronet</hi> at the <hi>Heel,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Skin in the form of a very white and malignant Matter, which denotes the greatneſs of the Corruption.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:179659:374"/>quality, 'tis ſucceeded by <hi>Warts</hi> and <hi>Clefts.</hi> It appears uſually at firſt at the ſide of the <hi>Paſterns,</hi> and afterwards aſcends to the middle of the <hi>Leg,</hi> peeling off ſome part of the Hair.</p>
                        <p>The Cure is not very difficult in the beginning; but when the Diſeaſe is invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the Courſe of the Humours conſtantly determin'd to the ſore Place, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as it were the Sink of all the Corruption in the Body: The Part ſwells, and is over-ſpread with <hi>Warts, Mules,</hi> and <hi>Clefts,</hi> which make the Cure very difficult.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as you perceive that your Horſe is troubl'd with this Diſtemper, let him Blood, but ſparingly, for 'twill be ſufficient to take away two Pounds of Blood; then give him every Morning for eight Days together, the Decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> or <hi>Box-Wood,</hi> and afterwards <hi>purge</hi> him, obſerving the ſame Method both in preparing and adminiſtring the Decoction, which is deſcrib'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> CXLVI. Theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines reach the Cauſe of the Diſtemper, by deſtroying and conſuming the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that occaſion it, and are not only very uſeful in this Caſe, but alſo for the Healing of all the Scabs and Sores that appear in <hi>Coach-Horſes</hi> Legs. And if a Horſe begin to be troubl'd with theſe Diſtempers while he is young, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevent the return of theſe Infirmities in his Legs, that diminiſh conſiderably both his Price and Goodneſs, by repeating the ſame Doſes of the <hi>Decoction</hi> and <hi>Purgative</hi> the two following Years.

                     <p>Shave away the Hair upon and about the ſore place as cloſe as you can, and anoint it with <hi>Oil of Linſeed</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> ſhaken together till they be perfectly mixt, and renewing the Mixture as often as you have occaſion to uſe it; becauſe

                     <p>
                        <hi>Warts</hi> muſt be cut off with a red-hot Knife; or you may endeavour to take 'em away with the <hi>Ointment</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> CLXXXI. or thoſe preſcrib'd for the <hi>Farcin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral others mention'd in this Book.

                        <p>Put an Ounce of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> with half an Ounce of <hi>Silver-Lace,</hi> burnt, waſh'd, and dry'd, into a <hi>Matraſs,</hi> placing it on hot Aſhes till the <hi>Silver</hi> be diſſolv'd, which quickly turns reddiſh: Then augmenting the Fire, evaporate all the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and there will remain at the bottom a brown Matter, uſually call'd <hi>Lapis Infernalis,</hi> or the <hi>perpetual Cauſtic,</hi> which muſt be kept dry and cover'd.</p>
                        <p>This Preparation is ſufficient for thoſe whoſe Curioſity never leads 'em out of the beaten Road; but it might be made much more effectual and proper for Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the following Directions.</p>
                        <p>Take two Ounces of either the <hi>Filings</hi> or <hi>thin Plates</hi> of fine <hi>Silver,</hi> and diſſolve 'em in five Ounces of ſtrong <hi>Aqua-fortis:</hi> Then pour the Solution into a <hi>Glaſs Cucurbit,</hi> cover'd with its <hi>Alembic,</hi> and draw off one half of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> with a Heat of Aſhes or Sand. Afterwards let the Veſſel ſtand ſome Hours to cool, and you will find at the bottom of the <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> a certain Matter in a <hi>Saline</hi> form, which muſt be put into a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large <hi>German Crucible,</hi> to prevent its boiling over. Set the <hi>Crucible</hi> in a ſmall Fire, till the Ebullition ceaſe, and the Matter ſink to the bottom; after which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Fire a little, and you will perceive the Matter reduc'd to the form of <hi>Oil</hi> at the bottom of the <hi>Crucible.</hi> Pour this <hi>Oil-like</hi> Subſtance into a very clean Mould, ſomewhat hot, and anointed with Tallow, where it will grow as hard as a Stone; and afterwards keep it in a well-ſtopp'd Glaſs-Bottle, and in a dry Place.</p>
                        <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the uſual Effect of this Stone is owing to the <hi>Corroſive Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> intangl'd and retain'd by this <hi>Silver:</hi> And all the reaſon why it might not be as well made with <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> is, that when 'tis prepar'd with thoſe imperfect Metals, it ſucks in too much Air, and ſoon turns to a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi> which, nevertheleſs, wou'd be an excellent <hi>Cauſtic:</hi> But that which is made with <hi>Silver</hi> retains its ſolid Form, and may be kept in a Bottle. 'Tis call'd <hi>Infernal</hi> both from its <hi>black</hi> Colour, and its <hi>cauſtic</hi> or <hi>burning</hi> Quality, in both which reſpects it may be ſaid to reſemble <hi>Hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Stone</hi> is alone ſufficient, without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Fire, Honey-Charge, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or any other Application, to conſume and deſtroy <hi>Warts,</hi> if they be rubb'd with it every Day till they be quite eaten away; but ſince 'tis ſomewhat dear, to prevent any uſeleſs waſte, you may beat the ſmalleſt pieces of it to Powder, and ſtrew it upon the <hi>Warts,</hi> after which the Scab will quickly fall away.</p>
                        <p>It may be alſo apply'd to <hi>Figs, Proud Fleſh,</hi> and other Tumours and Excreſcences that are to be extirpated. The ſame <hi>Stone</hi> ſerves a great while, ſince 'tis only made uſe of to rub the Part; but its Virtue is ſomewhat abated by wearing. This ſecond Preparation of the <hi>Infernal Stone</hi> is a very effectual Remedy for Men that are troubl'd with <hi>Cancers,</hi> which may be touch'd every Day with it till they fall away.</p>
                        <p>If by reaſon of the Malignity of the <hi>Pains,</hi> or other filthy Sores, the <hi>Hoof</hi> be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the <hi>Cronet</hi> at the <hi>Heel,</hi> you muſt apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> which will remove that Inconveniency, and make the <hi>Hoof</hi> grow. This ſeparation of the <hi>Hoof</hi> at the <hi>Heel</hi> of the hinder Leg, is not ſo conſiderable a Symptom as ſome may imagine, ſince it affects only the <hi>Hoof,</hi> without penetrating between the <hi>Foot</hi> and the <hi>Coffin-Bone;</hi> ſo that there is no danger of an Impoſtume in the Hairy part of the <hi>Foot.</hi>

                     <p>BOil eighteen large <hi>Lilly</hi> Roots chopt, with at leaſt two Gallons of <hi>Beer,</hi> or for want of that, of <hi>Barley-Water,</hi> or <hi>Whey,</hi> which, in my Opinion, is better in this Caſe than <hi>Beer:</hi> When the Roots begin to grow ſoft, and cleave under your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, add the Leaves of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows</hi> freed from their Stalks, of each ten Handfuls, or for want of the latter, double the quantity of the former. Continue boiling till the Roots and Herbs be reduc'd to a Maſh, pouring in <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Whey</hi> from time to time, to ſupply the place of that which is evaporated. When the whole is throughly boil'd, ſtrain the Maſh thro' a Hair-Sieve, turn'd upſide down, as the <hi>Pulp of Caſſia</hi> is uſually extracted, and throwing away the groſs Subſtance, boil the ſtraining for ſome time with a Pound of <hi>Tallow,</hi> and a like quantity of <hi>Butter,</hi> ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the while. Then remove the Veſſel from the Fire, and aſſoon as you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Boiling is perfectly ceas'd, add <hi>Honey</hi> and common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> of each one Pound, and incorporate 'em throughly with the reſt of the Ingredients, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole Mixture with a ſufficient Quantity of <hi>Wheat-Flower</hi> when it begins to grow luke-warm; tho' the Remedy might be made more effectual by boiling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way almoſt all the Moiſture before it be ſtrain'd, that there may be no need of thickening it with <hi>Flower:</hi> and therefore towards the end of the Boiling, when you ſee the Herbs begin to grow ſoft, and turn to a Maſh, you muſt not pour in any more <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Whey,</hi> to prevent the Liquidity of the Matter, which requires the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Flower.</hi> The ſtraining of the Maſh is a Circumſtance that ought not lightly to be omitted, for without that the Remedy wou'd neither be ſo grateful to the Eye, nor ſo effectual. It may be kept two Months in a dry place, if there be but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Beer</hi> left at the end of the Boiling. It retains its Virtues beſt when 'tis well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; and though the upper part appear Mouldy, it may be very good nearer the bottom.</p>
                     <p>If it be too <hi>thick,</hi> you may add ſome <hi>Beer</hi> when you have occaſion to uſe it; and if it be too <hi>thin,</hi> it may be thicken'd with a little <hi>Flower.</hi>

It muſt be added to the reſt of the Ingredients while they are luke-warm, before you put in the <hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To proceed, in the next place, to to the uſe and manner of Application. You muſt firſt ſhave away the Hair from the ſore place, and then apply the <hi>Honey-Charge</hi> cold with Flax, after the manner of a <hi>Pultiſs,</hi> renewing the Application once a Day, till the Sores be dry'd up: You muſt be very diligent to keep the part clean, and to take away all the Matter which the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> or <hi>Honey-Charge</hi> draws forth; and beſides, you muſt not forget to keep the Hair ſhort, for it grows very faſt during the uſe of this Remedy. Bind it on with broad Liſts of Cloth, and make uſe of that ſort of Bandage which Surgeons call <hi>expulſive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of this <hi>Honey-Charge, Farriers</hi> uſe another Remedy, call'd the <hi>White Plaiſter,</hi> which does a little qualifie and temper the ſharpneſs of the Humours, but is not at all proper to aſſwage the Swelling, or take the Fire out of a Leg. The <hi>White Plaiſter</hi> is prepar'd thus: They boil half a pound of <hi>Honey,</hi> a <hi>Litron</hi> of fine <hi>Wheat Flower,</hi> and a Pint of <hi>Milk,</hi> ſtirring 'em gently over a little Fire, till they begin to incorporate, and grow thick. Then adding four Ounces of common <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Oil-Olive,</hi> they continue boiling and ſtirring for ſome time, and apply it as I do the <hi>Honey-Charge.</hi> This is a cheap Remedy, and not altogether ineffectual, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Sores are not very great nor inveterate.</p>
                     <p>It happens not unfrequently in the Cure of ſwoll'n Legs, that the Humours being ſtopt, are condens'd upon the Fleſh, and grow hard by degrees; ſo that after a long continu'd Application of the <hi>Honey-Charge,</hi> the Moiſture being dry'd up, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

To proceed metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in the Cure of all the Infirmities of the <hi>Hough</hi> and <hi>Leg,</hi> you muſt never <hi>take up</hi> a Vein <hi>above,</hi> without taking it up alſo <hi>below.</hi> For ſince the modern Opinion, concerning the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> is undoubtedly certain, 'twou'd be in vain to ſtop its <hi>deſcent</hi> without barring at the ſame time its <hi>aſcent.</hi> For Example; a Sore or Swelling in the <hi>Hough</hi> can never be dry'd up or aſſwag'd by <hi>taking up</hi> the Vein <hi>above,</hi> ſince 'tis nouriſh'd by the Blood that aſcends from the Ends of the Veins; but this Inconveniency may be effectually prevented, and the Courſe of the Blood intirely intercepted, by <hi>taking up</hi> the Vein both <hi>above</hi> and <hi>below.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood</hi> is eſtabliſh'd on ſuch ſure Foundations, and all the Objections againſt it are ſo ſolidly refuted, that none but thoſe that are wilfully blind, refuſe their aſſent to it; and therefore 'tis meerly out of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to thoſe who are ſtill poſſeſt with their old Prejudices, that I order'd the Vein to be <hi>taken up</hi> both <hi>above</hi> and <hi>below,</hi> ſince the only neceſſary part of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that which is perform'd <hi>below;</hi> for the <hi>Veins</hi> bring back the Blood to the Heart, and from the Circumference to the Centre; whereas the <hi>Arteries</hi> carry it from the Heart to the Circumference: and 'tis only the groſſer part of the Blood that paſſes out of the <hi>Arteries</hi> into the <hi>Veins,</hi> by the <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> or Communications of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. From theſe Principles I might eaſily deduce ſeveral important Concluſions, in oppoſition to the common Practice; but I cou'd never take pleaſure in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:179659:376"/>others; and in ſuch Caſes as theſe, we ought rather to ſtudy how to <hi>do</hi> than how to <hi>ſpeak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every <hi>Farrier</hi> knows how to <hi>take up a Vein.</hi> Firſt they rub the Part very hard, to make the <hi>Vein</hi> ſwell, that they may diſcern it more diſtinctly from the Neighbouring <hi>Nerves;</hi> afterwards making an Inciſion length-ways, they ſeparate the <hi>Vein</hi> with the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and tying it at one end of the Inciſion with a double Silk Thread, they open it lengthways, either above or below the Ligature. Having taken away as much Blood as they can, they tie the <hi>Vein</hi> at the other end of the Inciſion, either above or below the former Ligature, and then cut it in the middle between the two Knots. But this laſt Circumſtance, tho' generally practis'd, is abſolutely unneceſſary, for without cutting the Vein, that part of it which is intercepted between the two Ligatures falls away, and the two Ends of it are clos'd: And even 'tis ſufficient to make only one Ligature, without opening the Vein; for the Knot cuts and corrupts the Vein, and the two Ends are afterwards clos'd and conſolidated. Some <hi>Farriers</hi> content themſelves with letting the Blood flow till it ſtop of it ſelf, and then dreſs the Wound without tying the Vein: And 'tis certainly the beſt way with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſpeedineſs of the Cure, to cut the Vein, and after it has bled plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bind it up without a Ligature, I mean in ſuch places where the Wound can be conveniently bound up; for when a Vein is ty'd, the Cure is extreamly tedious, ſince you muſt expect the Putrefaction and falling away of a piece of the Veſſel, and the cloſing or healing of the Ends of it. In the mean time 'tis the ſureſt way to prevent a further loſs of Blood by a Ligature, which muſt be kept ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tight for the ſpace of two Days. The ſame Operation is perform'd both above and below the <hi>Hough;</hi> but the ſecond Ligature ought to be as near the Foot as it can poſſibly be made, and directly oppoſite to the firſt, and after you have taken away a large quantity of Blood, you muſt proceed as before.</p>
                     <p>When the Horſes Legs are ſwoll'n and fleſhy, in which caſe the Cure is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, 'tis the uſual Cuſtom of ſome skilful <hi>Farriers</hi> to take out a piece of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Vein</hi> of the Thigh, beginning half a Foot above the <hi>Hough,</hi> and reaching about four Fingers breadth beneath it. This Operation is very effectual, but requires a skilful Hand: It produces a very good Effect, but frequently occaſions a very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pain, and an extraordinary Swelling in the <hi>Hough</hi> and <hi>Thigh;</hi> but when 'tis skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform'd, it drys the Thigh and Leg admirably, and is not attended with thoſe ill Conſequences: So that if you have a good Opinion of your <hi>Farrier's</hi> Skill, you may venture boldly on this Operation, which I have both perform'd and caus'd to be perform'd very frequently, eſpecially for the <hi>Blood-Spavin</hi> in the <hi>Hough.</hi> If the Legs be very much ſwoll'n, you may tie a Ribbon about the Vein at the Top of the Piece which you intend to take out; for after the Vein is ſeparated, the Ribbon remains in its place, and ſerves for a <hi>Seton,</hi> which muſt be dreſs'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Morning and Evening for nine Days together, that the ſwelling may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwag'd by the Evacuation of the <hi>Matter.</hi> In the mean time it will be highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to anoint the whole <hi>Hough</hi> every Day with the <hi>Duke's Ointment,</hi> to allay the Pain, and prevent an Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>I never order a piece of the Vein to be taken out when there is no apparent Swelling in the Legs, otherwiſe I immediately proceed to that Operation, eſpecially in the caſe of a <hi>Blood-Spavin,</hi> which is a ſoft Swelling, nouriſh'd by the great Vein. For tho' theſe Tumours do not make the Horſe halt, they occaſion an intolerable Deformity, and the only way to cure 'em is to take out a piece of the Vein, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the above-mention'd Directions.</p>
                     <p>After the Vein is <hi>taken up,</hi> apply the <hi>Duke's Ointment</hi> round the whole Leg and Thigh, to prevent a Swelling and Inflammation: Ten Days after, and ſometimes ſooner, the Vein will be heal'd, and the Horſe fit for Service.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Farcin</hi> is occaſion'd by the <hi>taking up</hi> of a Vein with a <hi>ruſty Lancet,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Knot</hi> appears in the place where the Vein was <hi>taken up.</hi> This is the uſual Fate of all Horſes that have an ill Habit of Body, and are ſo diſpos'd to the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin,</hi> that the leaſt Wound with the Tongue of a <hi>Buckle</hi> throws 'em into that Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner you may <hi>take up</hi> Veins in ſeveral Parts of the Body; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the <hi>Paſterns</hi> for the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Sole,</hi> for ill-ſhap'd <hi>Hoofs</hi> reſembling <hi>Oiſter-Shells,</hi> and after <hi>Foundering in the Feet;</hi> and for the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> you may <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>Eye-Veins</hi> with a crooked <hi>Needle,</hi> without Inciſion. See <hi>Chap.</hi> XXVIII.</p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:179659:377"/>
                     <p>You may alſo take up the <hi>Neck-Vein</hi> on both ſides, for the <hi>Glanders,</hi> and for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions in the <hi>Eyes;</hi> and there are ſeveral other Parts of the Body where the <hi>Veins</hi> may be <hi>taken up</hi> fort he Cure of their reſpective Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>You muſt never <hi>take up</hi> a Vein when the Leg is ſwoll'n; for beſides the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Operation, the Swelling will ſtill continue: And therefore you muſt wait till the Swelling be abated, before you <hi>take up the Vein.</hi>

                     <p>Take <hi>Linſeed-Oil</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> of each an equal quantity; ſhake 'em together in a Glaſs till they be well mixt, and anoint the Part Morning and Evening, having firſt clipt away the Hair. <hi>Note;</hi> That the <hi>Foot</hi> muſt be kept very clean.</p>
                     <p>I had a Horſe who being ty'd with two Chains entangl'd his Foot, and with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtruggling cut the Inſide of the <hi>Paſtern</hi> to the Bone, which occaſion'd a great Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his Leg and <hi>Paſtern,</hi> not without danger of a <hi>Gangrene.</hi> Immediately I order'd the Hair about the Part to be clipt away, (for his Foot was very hairy) and apply'd once a day the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> rubbing always the Leg with the <hi>Duke's Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He had been doom'd to irrecoverable Lameneſs by the <hi>Farriers,</hi> yet he was cur'd in a Month, and did not halt above ſix Weeks, tho' the Sinews and Bones were laid bare; but they were neither broken nor bruis'd. This was certainly a very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Cure, and even prevented my Expectation; for the <hi>Cronet</hi> was ſwoll'n and inflam'd, and I was afraid the Horſe ſhou'd have <hi>caſt</hi> his <hi>Hoof:</hi> And therefore before I dreſs'd the Hurt in the Hollow of the <hi>Paſtern</hi> with the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> I apply'd a good <hi>Aſtringent</hi> to the <hi>Cronet,</hi> made of Powder of <hi>unſlak'd Lime</hi> mix'd with the <hi>ſecond Water,</hi> binding it up with a Cover, and another upon the <hi>Honey-Charge.</hi> By this Method the Swelling of the <hi>Cronet</hi> was quickly aſſwag'd, and the Hurt was afterwards heal'd; tho' during the Cure there fell away Eſcars, that wou'd have frighten'd a Novice. Thus the Cure went on very ſucceſsfully, but ſome Horſes do not eſcape ſo well; for it has been often obſerv'd, that ſuch Accidents as thoſe have occaſion'd irrecoverable Lameneſs.</p>
                     <p>This may ſerve for an Inſtance of the Efficacy of the <hi>white Honey-Charge.</hi>

                     <p>I might propoſe ſeveral other Remedies, if this Example were not alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for your Inſtruction.

                     <p>THis Diſtemper is rarely obſerv'd, and ſometimes deceives the moſt expert <hi>Farriers:</hi> For 'tis impoſſible to know by any external Sign, that a Horſe is troubl'd with this Diſeaſe, when the Fit is not upon him, unleſs by his <hi>Leanneſs.</hi> 'Twou'd be a needleſs and impertinent piece of Formality, to write a Diſſertation about the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Cauſes</hi> of a Diſtemper that admits not of any Cure, and is beſides, ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that a Horſe who labours under it, is altogether unfit for hard Service, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may endure a little moderate Exerciſe. For aſſoon as the Natural Heat has finiſh'd its Work and Aliments in the Stomach, it acts with ſo much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt it ſelf, or againſt the neighbouring Parts, that the Horſe is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner depriv'd of the Uſe of his Limbs, and almoſt unable to ſtir his Feet, being equally inſenſible of Careſſes and Threatnings. He ſtands moveleſs, and ſuffers himſelf to be beaten and ſpurr'd without ſtirring, and even without feeling any other Pain than that which is caus'd by the violent Action of the Heat againſt the neighbouring Parts.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as you perceive your Horſe to be in this Condition, give him good ſtore of Provender, which will quickly make him fit for ſuch Service as he is able to perform. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that Horſes who are troubl'd with this Diſtemper, which in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies is call'd a <hi>Dog-like Appetite,</hi> eat three times as much as other Horſes, or even as themſelves did when in Health; tho' in the mean time they neither thrive, nor grow luſty. They are uſually ſeiz'd with the Fit about three Hours after eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If ſuch an Accident happen on the Road, you muſt immediately unbridle your Horſe, and let him eat as much as he can; after which you may take his Back again, and proceed on your Journey. But this Advice is not practicable in Winter, when there is no Graſs in the Fields, and therefore they that are Maſters of ſuch Horſes ought not to expoſe themſelves to the Danger of being ſuddenly ſtopt on the Road, and the beſt Advice I can give 'em is to rid themſelves of ſuch unſerviceable Horſes aſſoon as they can.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Horſes are uſuall Lean, tho' great Eaters, or rather Devourers of their Meat: But tho' it is impoſſible to fatten 'em, they ſtill retain ſome Vigour, unleſs in the time of the Fit, when they are altogether inſenſible. I know no Remedy to prevent the Return of the Paroxiſm: Perhaps ſome Perſon of more Learning than I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, may improve theſe Hints to a ſatisfactory Account of the Diſtemper; for my part, I have always made Conſcience of Writing nothing but what is grounded upon often-repeated Experiments. 'Tis true, I might make a great Noiſe with <hi>occult Cauſes,</hi> and fill whole Pages with <hi>Gibberiſh:</hi> But in my Opinion, it becomes a Man of Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to own his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as well as to communicate his <hi>Knowledge.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Cure is perform'd by waſhing the ſore Place with warm <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Urine;</hi> and if it be accompany'd with a <hi>Swelling,</hi> or <hi>Inflammation,</hi> you may apply the <hi>white Honey-Charge,</hi> which will <hi>abate</hi> the one, and <hi>allay</hi> the other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Crepances;</hi> the firſt, which is that I have already deſcrib'd, is attended with more Deformity than Danger: It is almoſt the ſame with <hi>Rat-Tails,</hi> and the other Sores that uſually over-ſpread the <hi>hinder Legs:</hi> But the ſecond Kind is much more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Horſes that have <hi>falſe Quarters,</hi> or cloven Hoofs like <hi>Oxen,</hi> are ſometimes troubl'd with <hi>Crepances.</hi> Theſe <hi>Cracks</hi> or <hi>Clefts,</hi> proceed from the Dryneſs of the Hoof, which bruiſes the Fleſh between the Hoof and the Bone of the Foot; and the putrefy'd Fleſh infects the <hi>Tendon</hi> or Griſtle: So that Nature, endeavouring to expel what offends her, burſts the Hoof in the middle of the Quarter, and the Matter finds a Paſſage thro' the Cleft, near the hairy part of the Foot.

                     <head>CHAP. CLXXXIX. <hi>Of the</hi> Numneſs of the Hoof.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Name</hi> of a Diſtemper uſually gives us a confus'd Idea of the <hi>Nature</hi> of it; but the Word, introduc'd by Cuſtom to expreſs the Diſeaſe treated off in this Chapter, ſeems not to have the leaſt Relation to what it ſignifies. However I will not quarrel about <hi>Words,</hi> but rather proceed to a brief Explication of the Diſtemper, commonly known by this Name, to which I ſhall ſubjoin an Account of its <hi>Signs, Cauſes,</hi> and ſureſt <hi>Remedies,</hi> after I have told you that the Cure is extremely difficult, or at leaſt very tedious.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, you muſt know, that there is a Bone in the Middle of the <hi>Coffin-Bone,</hi> which is almoſt of the ſame Figure with the Foot, but much ſmaller, ſince 'tis contain'd within it. This is that which we uſually call the <hi>Bone of the Foot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now a Horſe is ſaid to be troubl'd with this Diſtemper, when the Bone of the Foot, by reaſon of a Relaxation at the End oppoſite to the Toe, leaves its Place, and natural Situation; and the Fleſh that ſurrounded it, and united it to the Hoof growing dry, there remains a hollow or empty Space: Beſides the Bone of the Foot being looſen'd at one end, falls down, and preſſing againſt the <hi>Sole</hi> that covers it, appears in Form of a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> as if there were another Bone faſten'd to the Outſide of the Bone of the Foot, whereas it is only that Bone it ſelf fall'n down out of its natural Place, and appearing in the Figure of a Creſcent, which is greater or ſmaller, as the Bone is more or leſs looſen'd.</p>
                     <p>This Bone is ſeldom looſen'd towards the <hi>Heel,</hi> to which 'tis faſten'd by two great <hi>Sinews,</hi> that paſs thro' it in two ſeveral Places, and bind it ſo faſt to the Foot, that unleſs it be looſen'd by ſome violent Accident, it never deſcends but towards the <hi>Toe;</hi> in which Caſe there remains a void ſpace that was formerly fill'd with the Fleſh that ſurrounded the Bone before it was looſen'd, ſo that the <hi>Coffin-Bone,</hi> and the Bone of the Foot, were in a manner one continu'd Body, ſo cloſely were they united; whereas in this Caſe there is a hollow Space along the Hoof towards the <hi>Toe,</hi> and the Extent of that Hollowneſs is proportionable to the Relaxation of the Bone.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper may be known by theſe Signs. The Horſe halts right down; he trots, and even walks upon his Heels, and brings down his Toes ſoftly to the Ground, without laying any ſtreſs upon 'em: The Fore-part of the Foot ſounds hollow when
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:179659:378"/>you knock upon it with your <hi>Shooing-Hammer;</hi> at laſt it ſhrinks in the Middle, and the Foot loſes its natural Shape.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe has ſome Affinity with <hi>Foundering in the Feet,</hi> but is leſs malignant, and more eaſily cur'd. The Effects are almoſt the ſame in both Caſes, for when a Horſe is <hi>founder'd in the Feet,</hi> the Bone of the Foot is looſen'd before, and forms <hi>Creſcents,</hi> like thoſe deſcrib'd in this Chapter, only they are greater, and appear uſually on both Feet, whereas this Diſtemper rarely attacks more than one. Theſe <hi>Creſcents</hi> in either Caſe, are only the Bone of the Foot relax'd; deſcending from its natural Place, and appearing like a <hi>Creſcent</hi> without the Fleſh that formerly us'd to cover it: So that you muſt not give Credit to the Opinion of certain <hi>Farriers,</hi> who imagine it to be a Bone, or bony Excreſcency, growing upon the Bone of the Foot. This Bone thus relax'd, and appearing in the above-mention'd Form, is at laſt depriv'd of Nouriſhment, and grows, as it were, one extraneous or preternatural Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt either fall away, or be cut out.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things were neceſſary to be premis'd, in order to a clearer underſtanding of the Diſtemper; but ſince I have hitherto only explain'd the Effect of the Cauſe, I ſhall, in the next place, conſider the Cauſe it ſelf. When a Horſe by reaſon of vehement labour, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated, the Humours are put in Motion by this Impreſſion of Heat, and the Agitation is encreas'd by other more ſubtil Humours, which being out of their natural Place, and beſides, thin, ſharp, and ſpirituous, ferment the groſſer Humours with which they are mix'd. This Ebullition occaſions the riſing of very ſharp Vapours, full of a volatile and corroſive Salt, which inſinuating into the Parts where they find leaſt Reſiſtance, and in their way paſſing thro' ſome places where the natural Heat is moderate, being no longer agitated nor ſupported by the Fermentation that rais'd 'em, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd into Water, which is carry'd by its own Weight to the Foot; where they find an eaſie Admittance into the ſpongy Fleſh, between the Hoof and the Bone.</p>
                     <p>Now this Water or Liquor retaining the ſharp and corroſive Nature of its primitive Vapours, and in many Reſpects reſembling <hi>Aqua-Fortis;</hi> it conſumes all the Fleſh that united the Hoof and the Bone, and at the ſame time dries up and ſeparates a vaſt Number of little Nerves that proceed from the Bone of the Foot, and faſten it to the Hoof: So that the Bone being no longer ſuſtain'd or kept in it places by the Fleſh, or thoſe little Nerves, falls down towards the ſore-part of the Foot, forms a <hi>Creſcent</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Sole,</hi> and leaves the fore-part of the Hoof empty and hollow.</p>
                     <p>Having already explain'd the Nature of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and illuſtrated that Explication with clear and proper Examples, I know no reaſonable Objection that can be made againſt the Account I have given of this Diſtemper. Only methinks I hear ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Wou'd-be-Wits</hi> enquire, who told me all theſe fine Stories, and whether I or my Informers were ever Witneſſes of thoſe Tranſactions in the Body. But a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtock of Senſe wou'd enable 'em to conceive, that tho' neither I, nor any Man elſe can pretend to have ſeen thoſe internal Motions and Revolutions, 'tis not at all impoſſible that a ſtudious Enquirer into Nature may diſcover the <hi>Cauſes</hi> by their <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</hi> And withal, I aſſure 'em, that if they can produce a more probable <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and confirm it with more, or better Experiments, I will receive it in ſuch a Manner, that they themſelves ſhall acknowledge, that I am neither of a very obſtinate Nature, nor over-fond of my own Notions.</p>
                     <p>'Twill not be improper in the next place, to examine the Difference between the Humour that cauſes this Diſtemper, and that which cauſes <hi>Foundering.</hi> The latter of theſe Humours is more ſubtil, and penetrating the Nerves, obſtructs their Motion, and occaſions Pain; whereas the Humour from whence this Diſtemper proceeds, takes its Courſe thro' ways unknown to us, without cauſing thoſe Diſturbances that are obſerv'd in the other Caſe. And perhaps I may venture to ſay, that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is the ſame tho' the <hi>Effects</hi> be different, according to the various degrees of the Acrimony of the Salt of which theſe Spirits are full.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Diſtemper, you muſt endeavour by all means, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the <hi>Sole</hi> about the <hi>Toe,</hi> for Nature may perhaps in time diſſolve the <hi>Creſcent:</hi> And to aſſiſt her in the Execution of that Work, 'twill be convenient to pour a ſufficient quantity of the fineſt <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> into the Foot, without paring it or cutting the <hi>Sole;</hi> after which you muſt ſtop the Foot with Flax, and lay Splents over all. At the ſame time anoint the <hi>Cronet,</hi> eſpecially about the <hi>Toe,</hi> with the ſame <hi>Oil,</hi> covering it with Flax and a convenient Bandage. <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Oil</hi> muſt be apply'd cold to the <hi>Cronet,</hi> and pour'd boiling-hot into the <hi>Foot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:179659:379"/>
                     <p>After you have contiunu'd for ſome time in the Uſe of this Method, without any conſiderable Sign of Amendment, if the the Horſe be ſtill very lean, you muſt take out the <hi>Sole,</hi> and if you find the point of the Bone of the Foot ſeparated from the Hoof with an empty Space between 'em, you muſt burn all that part of the Bone that ſeems to be ſeparated both above and below, to haſten its falling away: Then apply <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> to the burnt Bone, and charge the whole <hi>Sole</hi> with a Mixture of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Honey,</hi> and <hi>Tarr</hi> melted together. Continue to dreſs the Bone with <hi>Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or <hi>Schmit's Ointment,</hi> till it fall out, after which, dreſs the part of the Bone from which the Piece that fell away was ſeparated, with <hi>Monſieur Curty's Ointment</hi> apply'd cold, or only with Flax dipt in <hi>Brandy,</hi> renewing the Application every two Days, which will make the Fleſh grow again, and cover the Bone: After which the Sole will grow again alſo. To promote the Growth of the <hi>Sole,</hi> and make it firm and vigorous, you may obſerve the Directions in the LXXXIXth. Chapter, <hi>Concerning the Method of taking out the Sole.</hi> Aſſoon as you perceive that the <hi>Sole</hi> is grown ſtrong, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to walk your Horſe on ſoft Ground, and by degrees accuſtom him to travel.</p>
                     <p>If by looking into the Foot you perceive that the <hi>Creſcent</hi> is not great, and have reaſon to conclude that the Diſeaſe is not very dangerous, you ought not to take out the <hi>Sole</hi> without Neceſſity, but rather endeavour to ſtrengthen it by pouring boiling <hi>Oil of Bay</hi> into the <hi>Foot,</hi> as I order'd before; and continuing after the ſame manner till the Cure be compleated.</p>
                     <p>This may be juſtly reckon'd a dangerous Diſtemper, the Cure is long and difficult, and very frequently the Horſe continues lame for the ſpace of a Year, and longer. Several <hi>Farriers</hi> confound this Infirmity with <hi>Surbating,</hi> and other Diſeaſes in the <hi>Feet:</hi> But the Eaſineſs of the Cure in theſe Caſes, ought to convince 'em of their Errour.</p>
